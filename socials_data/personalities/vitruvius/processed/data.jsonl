PROFESSOR OF ARCHITECTURE\nIN HARVARD UNIVERSITY\nCAMBRIDGE\nHARVARD UNIVERSITY PRESS\nLONDON: HUMPHREY MILFORD\nOXFORD UNIVERSITY PRESS\n1914\nCOPYRIGHT, HARVARD UNIVERSITY PRESS\n*       *       *       *       *\nPREFACE\nDuring the last years of his life, Professor Morgan had devoted much\ntime and energy to the preparation of a translation of Vitruvius, which\nhe proposed to supplement with a revised text, illustrations, and notes.\nHe had completed the translation, with the exception of the last four\nchapters of the tenth book, and had discussed, with Professor Warren,\nthe illustrations intended for the first six books of the work; the\nnotes had not been arranged or completed, though many of them were\noutlined in the manuscript, or the intention to insert them indicated.\nThe several books of the translation, so far as it was completed, had\nbeen read to a little group of friends, consisting of Professors Sheldon\nand Kittredge, and myself, and had received our criticism, which had, at\ntimes, been utilized in the revision of the work.\nAfter the death of Professor Morgan, in spite of my obvious incompetency\nfrom a technical point of view, I undertook, at the request of his\nfamily, to complete the translation, and to see the book through the\npress. I must, therefore, assume entire responsibility for the\ntranslation of the tenth book, beginning with chapter thirteen, and\nfurther responsibility for necessary changes made by me in the earlier\npart of the translation, changes which, in no case, affect any theory\nheld by Professor Morgan, but which involve mainly the adoption of\nsimpler forms of statement, or the correction of obvious oversights.\nThe text followed is that of Valentine Rose in his second edition\n(Leipzig, 1899), and the variations from this text are, with a few\nexceptions which are indicated in the footnotes, in the nature of a\nreturn to the consensus of the manuscript readings.\nThe illustrations in the first six books are believed to be\nsubstantially in accord with the wishes of Professor Morgan. The\nsuggestions for illustrations in the later books were incomplete, and\ndid not indicate, in all cases, with sufficient definiteness to allow\nthem to be executed, the changes from conventional plans and designs\nintended by the translator. It has, therefore, been decided to include\nin this part of the work only those illustrations which are known to\nhave had the full approval of Professor Morgan. The one exception to\nthis principle is the reproduction of a rough model of the Ram of\nHegetor, constructed by me on the basis of the measurements given by\nVitruvius and Athenaeus.\nIt does not seem to me necessary or even advisable to enter into a long\ndiscussion as to the date of Vitruvius, which has been assigned to\nvarious periods from the time of Augustus to the early centuries of our\nera. Professor Morgan, in several articles in the _Harvard Studies in\nClassical Philology_, and in the _Proceedings of the American Academy_,\nall of which have been reprinted in a volume of _Addresses and Essays_\n(New York, 1909), upheld the now generally accepted view that Vitruvius\nwrote in the time of Augustus, and furnished conclusive evidence that\nnothing in his language is inconsistent with this view. In revising the\ntranslation, I met with one bit of evidence for a date before the end of\nthe reign of Nero which I have never seen adduced. In viii, 3, 21, the\nkingdom of Cottius is mentioned, the name depending, it is true, on an\nemendation, but one which has been universally accepted since it was\nfirst proposed in 1513. The kingdom of Cottius was made into a Roman\nprovince by Nero (cf. Suetonius, _Nero_, 18), and it is inconceivable\nthat any Roman writer subsequently referred to it as a kingdom.\nIt does seem necessary to add a few words about the literary merits of\nVitruvius in this treatise, and about Professor Morgan's views as to the\ngeneral principles to be followed in the translation.\nVitruvius was not a great literary personage, ambitious as he was to\nappear in that character. As Professor Morgan has aptly said, \"he has\nall the marks of one unused to composition, to whom writing is a painful\ntask.\" In his hand the measuring-rod was a far mightier implement than\nthe pen. His turgid and pompous rhetoric displays itself in the\nintroductions to the different books, where his exaggerated effort to\nintroduce some semblance of style into his commonplace lectures on the\nnoble principles which should govern the conduct of the architect, or\ninto the prosaic lists of architects and writers on architecture, is\neverywhere apparent. Even in the more technical portions of his work, a\nlike conscious effort may be detected, and, at the same time, a lack of\nconfidence in his ability to express himself in unmistakable language.\nHe avoids periodic sentences, uses only the simpler subjunctive\nconstructions, repeats the antecedent in relative clauses, and, not\ninfrequently, adopts a formal language closely akin to that of\nspecifications and contracts, the style with which he was, naturally,\nmost familiar. He ends each book with a brief summary, almost a formula,\nsomewhat like a sigh of relief, in which the reader unconsciously\nshares. At times his meaning is ambiguous, not because of grammatical\nfaults, which are comparatively few and unimportant, but because, when\nhe does attempt a periodic sentence, he becomes involved, and finds it\ndifficult to extricate himself.\nSome of these peculiarities and crudities of expression Professor Morgan\npurposely imitated, because of his conviction that a translation should\nnot merely reproduce the substance of a book, but should also give as\nclear a picture as possible of the original, of its author, and of the\nworking of his mind. The translation is intended, then, to be faithful\nand exact, but it deliberately avoids any attempt to treat the language\nof Vitruvius as though it were Ciceronian, or to give a false impression\nof conspicuous literary merit in a work which is destitute of that\nquality. The translator had, however, the utmost confidence in the\nsincerity of Vitruvius and in the serious purpose of his treatise on\narchitecture.\nTo those who have liberally given their advice and suggestions in\nresponse to requests from Professor Morgan, it is impossible for me to\nmake adequate acknowledgment. Their number is so great, and my knowledge\nof the indebtedness in individual cases is so small, that each must be\ncontent with the thought of the full and generous acknowledgment which\nhe would have received had Professor Morgan himself written this\npreface.\nPersonally I am under the greatest obligations to Professor H. L.\nWarren, who has freely given both assistance and criticism; to Professor\nG. L. Kittredge, who has read with me most of the proof; to the Syndics\nof the Harvard University Press, who have made possible the publication\nof the work; and to the members of the Visiting Committee of the\nDepartment of the Classics and the classmates of Professor Morgan, who\nhave generously supplied the necessary funds for the illustrations.\nALBERT A.

While your divine intelligence and will, Imperator Caesar, were\nengaged in acquiring the right to command the world, and while your\nfellow citizens, when all their enemies had been laid low by your\ninvincible valour, were glorying in your triumph and victory,--while all\nforeign nations were in subjection awaiting your beck and call, and the\nRoman people and senate, released from their alarm, were beginning to be\nguided by your most noble conceptions and policies, I hardly dared, in\nview of your serious employments, to publish my writings and long\nconsidered ideas on architecture, for fear of subjecting myself to your\ndispleasure by an unseasonable interruption.\n2. But when I saw that you were giving your attention not only to the\nwelfare of society in general and to the establishment of public order,\nbut also to the providing of public buildings intended for utilitarian\npurposes, so that not only should the State have been enriched with\nprovinces by your means, but that the greatness of its power might\nlikewise be attended with distinguished authority in its public\nbuildings, I thought that I ought to take the first opportunity to lay\nbefore you my writings on this theme. For in the first place it was this\nsubject which made me known to your father, to whom I was devoted on\naccount of his great qualities. After the council of heaven gave him a\nplace in the dwellings of immortal life and transferred your father's\npower to your hands, my devotion continuing unchanged as I remembered\nhim inclined me to support you. And so with Marcus Aurelius, Publius\nMinidius, and Gnaeus Cornelius, I was ready to supply and repair\nballistae, scorpiones, and other artillery, and I have received rewards\nfor good service with them. After your first bestowal of these upon me,\nyou continued to renew them on the recommendation of your sister.\n3. Owing to this favour I need have no fear of want to the end of my\nlife, and being thus laid under obligation I began to write this work\nfor you, because I saw that you have built and are now building\nextensively, and that in future also you will take care that our public\nand private buildings shall be worthy to go down to posterity by the\nside of your other splendid achievements. I have drawn up definite rules\nto enable you, by observing them, to have personal knowledge of the\nquality both of existing buildings and of those which are yet to be\nconstructed. For in the following books I have disclosed all the\nprinciples of the art.\nCHAPTER I\nTHE EDUCATION OF THE ARCHITECT\n1. The architect should be equipped with knowledge of many branches of\nstudy and varied kinds of learning, for it is by his judgement that all\nwork done by the other arts is put to test. This knowledge is the child\nof practice and theory. Practice is the continuous and regular exercise\nof employment where manual work is done with any necessary material\naccording to the design of a drawing. Theory, on the other hand, is the\nability to demonstrate and explain the productions of dexterity on the\nprinciples of proportion.\n2. It follows, therefore, that architects who have aimed at acquiring\nmanual skill without scholarship have never been able to reach a\nposition of authority to correspond to their pains, while those who\nrelied only upon theories and scholarship were obviously hunting the\nshadow, not the substance. But those who have a thorough knowledge of\nboth, like men armed at all points, have the sooner attained their\nobject and carried authority with them.\n3. In all matters, but particularly in architecture, there are these two\npoints:--the thing signified, and that which gives it its significance.\nThat which is signified is the subject of which we may be speaking; and\nthat which gives significance is a demonstration on scientific\nprinciples. It appears, then, that one who professes himself an\narchitect should be well versed in both directions. He ought, therefore,\nto be both naturally gifted and amenable to instruction. Neither natural\nability without instruction nor instruction without natural ability can\nmake the perfect artist. Let him be educated, skilful with the pencil,\ninstructed in geometry, know much history, have followed the\nphilosophers with attention, understand music, have some knowledge of\nmedicine, know the opinions of the jurists, and be acquainted with\nastronomy and the theory of the heavens.\n4. The reasons for all this are as follows. An architect ought to be an\neducated man so as to leave a more lasting remembrance in his treatises.\nSecondly, he must have a knowledge of drawing so that he can readily\nmake sketches to show the appearance of the work which he proposes.\nGeometry, also, is of much assistance in architecture, and in particular\nit teaches us the use of the rule and compasses, by which especially we\nacquire readiness in making plans for buildings in their grounds, and\nrightly apply the square, the level, and the plummet. By means of\noptics, again, the light in buildings can be drawn from fixed quarters\nof the sky. It is true that it is by arithmetic that the total cost of\nbuildings is calculated and measurements are computed, but difficult\nquestions involving symmetry are solved by means of geometrical theories\nand methods.\n5. A wide knowledge of history is requisite because, among the\nornamental parts of an architect's design for a work, there are many the\nunderlying idea of whose employment he should be able to explain to\ninquirers. For instance, suppose him to set up the marble statues of\nwomen in long robes, called Caryatides, to take the place of columns,\nwith the mutules and coronas placed directly above their heads, he will\ngive the following explanation to his questioners. Caryae, a state in\nPeloponnesus, sided with the Persian enemies against Greece; later the\nGreeks, having gloriously won their freedom by victory in the war, made\ncommon cause and declared war against the people of Caryae. They took\nthe town, killed the men, abandoned the State to desolation, and carried\noff their wives into slavery, without permitting them, however, to lay\naside the long robes and other marks of their rank as married women, so\nthat they might be obliged not only to march in the triumph but to\nappear forever after as a type of slavery, burdened with the weight of\ntheir shame and so making atonement for their State. Hence, the\narchitects of the time designed for public buildings statues of these\nwomen, placed so as to carry a load, in order that the sin and the\npunishment of the people of Caryae might be known and handed down even\nto posterity.\n[Illustration: Photo. H. B. Warren CARYATIDES OF THE ERECHTHEUM AT\nATHENS]\n[Illustration: CARYATIDES FROM THE TREASURY OF THE CNIDIANS AT DELPHI]\n[Illustration: Photo. Anderson CARYATIDES NOW IN THE VILLA ALBANI AT\nROME]\n[Illustration: CARYATIDES (From the edition of Vitruvius by Fra\nGiocondo, Venice, 1511)]\n6. Likewise the Lacedaemonians under the leadership of Pausanias, son of\nAgesipolis, after conquering the Persian armies, infinite in number,\nwith a small force at the battle of Plataea, celebrated a glorious\ntriumph with the spoils and booty, and with the money obtained from the\nsale thereof built the Persian Porch, to be a monument to the renown and\nvalour of the people and a trophy of victory for posterity. And there\nthey set effigies of the prisoners arrayed in barbarian costume and\nholding up the roof, their pride punished by this deserved affront,\nthat enemies might tremble for fear of the effects of their courage,\nand that their own people, looking upon this ensample of their valour\nand encouraged by the glory of it, might be ready to defend their\nindependence. So from that time on, many have put up statues of Persians\nsupporting entablatures and their ornaments, and thus from that motive\nhave greatly enriched the diversity of their works. There are other\nstories of the same kind which architects ought to know.\n7. As for philosophy, it makes an architect high-minded and not\nself-assuming, but rather renders him courteous, just, and honest\nwithout avariciousness. This is very important, for no work can be\nrightly done without honesty and incorruptibility. Let him not be\ngrasping nor have his mind preoccupied with the idea of receiving\nperquisites, but let him with dignity keep up his position by cherishing\na good reputation. These are among the precepts of philosophy.\nFurthermore philosophy treats of physics (in Greek [Greek: physiologia])\nwhere a more careful knowledge is required because the problems which\ncome under this head are numerous and of very different kinds; as, for\nexample, in the case of the conducting of water. For at points of intake\nand at curves, and at places where it is raised to a level, currents of\nair naturally form in one way or another; and nobody who has not learned\nthe fundamental principles of physics from philosophy will be able to\nprovide against the damage which they do. So the reader of Ctesibius or\nArchimedes and the other writers of treatises of the same class will not\nbe able to appreciate them unless he has been trained in these subjects\nby the philosophers.\n8. Music, also, the architect ought to understand so that he may have\nknowledge of the canonical and mathematical theory, and besides be able\nto tune ballistae, catapultae, and scorpiones to the proper key. For to\nthe right and left in the beams are the holes in the frames through\nwhich the strings of twisted sinew are stretched by means of windlasses\nand bars, and these strings must not be clamped and made fast until they\ngive the same correct note to the ear of the skilled workman. For the\narms thrust through those stretched strings must, on being let go,\nstrike their blow together at the same moment; but if they are not in\nunison, they will prevent the course of projectiles from being straight.\n[Illustration: PERSIANS\n(From the edition of Vitruvius by Fra Giocondo, Venice, 1511)]\n9. In theatres, likewise, there are the bronze vessels (in Greek [Greek:\n\u00eacheia]) which are placed in niches under the seats in accordance with\nthe musical intervals on mathematical principles. These vessels are\narranged with a view to musical concords or harmony, and apportioned in\nthe compass of the fourth, the fifth, and the octave, and so on up to\nthe double octave, in such a way that when the voice of an actor falls\nin unison with any of them its power is increased, and it reaches the\nears of the audience with greater clearness and sweetness. Water\norgans, too, and the other instruments which resemble them cannot be\nmade by one who is without the principles of music.\n10. The architect should also have a knowledge of the study of medicine\non account of the questions of climates (in Greek [Greek: klimata]),\nair, the healthiness and unhealthiness of sites, and the use of\ndifferent waters. For without these considerations, the healthiness of a\ndwelling cannot be assured. And as for principles of law, he should know\nthose which are necessary in the case of buildings having party walls,\nwith regard to water dripping from the eaves, and also the laws about\ndrains, windows, and water supply. And other things of this sort should\nbe known to architects, so that, before they begin upon buildings, they\nmay be careful not to leave disputed points for the householders to\nsettle after the works are finished, and so that in drawing up contracts\nthe interests of both employer and contractor may be wisely\nsafe-guarded. For if a contract is skilfully drawn, each may obtain a\nrelease from the other without disadvantage. From astronomy we find the\neast, west, south, and north, as well as the theory of the heavens, the\nequinox, solstice, and courses of the stars. If one has no knowledge of\nthese matters, he will not be able to have any comprehension of the\ntheory of sundials.\n11. Consequently, since this study is so vast in extent, embellished and\nenriched as it is with many different kinds of learning, I think that\nmen have no right to profess themselves architects hastily, without\nhaving climbed from boyhood the steps of these studies and thus, nursed\nby the knowledge of many arts and sciences, having reached the heights\nof the holy ground of architecture.\n12. But perhaps to the inexperienced it will seem a marvel that human\nnature can comprehend such a great number of studies and keep them in\nthe memory. Still, the observation that all studies have a common bond\nof union and intercourse with one another, will lead to the belief that\nthis can easily be realized. For a liberal education forms, as it were,\na single body made up of these members. Those, therefore, who from\ntender years receive instruction in the various forms of learning,\nrecognize the same stamp on all the arts, and an intercourse between all\nstudies, and so they more readily comprehend them all. This is what led\none of the ancient architects, Pytheos, the celebrated builder of the\ntemple of Minerva at Priene, to say in his Commentaries that an\narchitect ought to be able to accomplish much more in all the arts and\nsciences than the men who, by their own particular kinds of work and the\npractice of it, have brought each a single subject to the highest\nperfection. But this is in point of fact not realized.\n13. For an architect ought not to be and cannot be such a philologian as\nwas Aristarchus, although not illiterate; nor a musician like\nAristoxenus, though not absolutely ignorant of music; nor a painter like\nApelles, though not unskilful in drawing; nor a sculptor such as was\nMyron or Polyclitus, though not unacquainted with the plastic art; nor\nagain a physician like Hippocrates, though not ignorant of medicine; nor\nin the other sciences need he excel in each, though he should not be\nunskilful in them. For, in the midst of all this great variety of\nsubjects, an individual cannot attain to perfection in each, because it\nis scarcely in his power to take in and comprehend the general theories\nof them.\n14. Still, it is not architects alone that cannot in all matters reach\nperfection, but even men who individually practise specialties in the\narts do not all attain to the highest point of merit. Therefore, if\namong artists working each in a single field not all, but only a few in\nan entire generation acquire fame, and that with difficulty, how can an\narchitect, who has to be skilful in many arts, accomplish not merely the\nfeat--in itself a great marvel--of being deficient in none of them, but\nalso that of surpassing all those artists who have devoted themselves\nwith unremitting industry to single fields?\n15. It appears, then, that Pytheos made a mistake by not observing that\nthe arts are each composed of two things, the actual work and the theory\nof it. One of these, the doing of the work, is proper to men trained in\nthe individual subject, while the other, the theory, is common to all\nscholars: for example, to physicians and musicians the rhythmical beat\nof the pulse and its metrical movement. But if there is a wound to be\nhealed or a sick man to be saved from danger, the musician will not\ncall, for the business will be appropriate to the physician. So in the\ncase of a musical instrument, not the physician but the musician will be\nthe man to tune it so that the ears may find their due pleasure in its\nstrains.\n16. Astronomers likewise have a common ground for discussion with\nmusicians in the harmony of the stars and musical concords in tetrads\nand triads of the fourth and the fifth, and with geometricians in the\nsubject of vision (in Greek [Greek: logos optikos]); and in all other\nsciences many points, perhaps all, are common so far as the discussion\nof them is concerned. But the actual undertaking of works which are\nbrought to perfection by the hand and its manipulation is the function\nof those who have been specially trained to deal with a single art. It\nappears, therefore, that he has done enough and to spare who in each\nsubject possesses a fairly good knowledge of those parts, with their\nprinciples, which are indispensable for architecture, so that if he is\nrequired to pass judgement and to express approval in the case of those\nthings or arts, he may not be found wanting. As for men upon whom nature\nhas bestowed so much ingenuity, acuteness, and memory that they are able\nto have a thorough knowledge of geometry, astronomy, music, and the\nother arts, they go beyond the functions of architects and become pure\nmathematicians. Hence they can readily take up positions against those\narts because many are the artistic weapons with which they are armed.\nSuch men, however, are rarely found, but there have been such at times;\nfor example, Aristarchus of Samos, Philolaus and Archytas of Tarentum,\nApollonius of Perga, Eratosthenes of Cyrene, and among Syracusans\nArchimedes and Scopinas, who through mathematics and natural philosophy\ndiscovered, expounded, and left to posterity many things in connexion\nwith mechanics and with sundials.\n17. Since, therefore, the possession of such talents due to natural\ncapacity is not vouchsafed at random to entire nations, but only to a\nfew great men; since, moreover, the function of the architect requires a\ntraining in all the departments of learning; and finally, since reason,\non account of the wide extent of the subject, concedes that he may\npossess not the highest but not even necessarily a moderate knowledge of\nthe subjects of study, I request, Caesar, both of you and of those who\nmay read the said books, that if anything is set forth with too little\nregard for grammatical rule, it may be pardoned. For it is not as a very\ngreat philosopher, nor as an eloquent rhetorician, nor as a grammarian\ntrained in the highest principles of his art, that I have striven to\nwrite this work, but as an architect who has had only a dip into those\nstudies. Still, as regards the efficacy of the art and the theories of\nit, I promise and expect that in these volumes I shall undoubtedly show\nmyself of very considerable importance not only to builders but also to\nall scholars.\nCHAPTER II\nTHE FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES OF ARCHITECTURE\n1. Architecture depends on Order (in Greek [Greek: taxis]), Arrangement\n(in Greek [Greek: diathesis]), Eurythmy, Symmetry, Propriety, and\nEconomy (in Greek [Greek: oikonomia]).\n2. Order gives due measure to the members of a work considered\nseparately, and symmetrical agreement to the proportions of the whole.\nIt is an adjustment according to quantity (in Greek [Greek: posot\u00eas]).\nBy this I mean the selection of modules from the members of the work\nitself and, starting from these individual parts of members,\nconstructing the whole work to correspond. Arrangement includes the\nputting of things in their proper places and the elegance of effect\nwhich is due to adjustments appropriate to the character of the work.\nIts forms of expression (Greek [Greek: ideai]) are these: groundplan,\nelevation, and perspective. A groundplan is made by the proper\nsuccessive use of compasses and rule, through which we get outlines for\nthe plane surfaces of buildings. An elevation is a picture of the front\nof a building, set upright and properly drawn in the proportions of the\ncontemplated work. Perspective is the method of sketching a front with\nthe sides withdrawing into the background, the lines all meeting in the\ncentre of a circle. All three come of reflexion and invention. Reflexion\nis careful and laborious thought, and watchful attention directed to the\nagreeable effect of one's plan. Invention, on the other hand, is the\nsolving of intricate problems and the discovery of new principles by\nmeans of brilliancy and versatility. These are the departments belonging\nunder Arrangement.\n3. Eurythmy is beauty and fitness in the adjustments of the members.\nThis is found when the members of a work are of a height suited to their\nbreadth, of a breadth suited to their length, and, in a word, when they\nall correspond symmetrically.\n4. Symmetry is a proper agreement between the members of the work\nitself, and relation between the different parts and the whole general\nscheme, in accordance with a certain part selected as standard. Thus in\nthe human body there is a kind of symmetrical harmony between forearm,\nfoot, palm, finger, and other small parts; and so it is with perfect\nbuildings. In the case of temples, symmetry may be calculated from the\nthickness of a column, from a triglyph, or even from a module; in the\nballista, from the hole or from what the Greeks call the [Greek:\nperitr\u00eatos]; in a ship, from the space between the tholepins [Greek:\n(diap\u00eagma)]; and in other things, from various members.\n5. Propriety is that perfection of style which comes when a work is\nauthoritatively constructed on approved principles. It arises from\nprescription [Greek: (thematism\u00f4)], from usage, or from nature. From\nprescription, in the case of hypaethral edifices, open to the sky, in\nhonour of Jupiter Lightning, the Heaven, the Sun, or the Moon: for these\nare gods whose semblances and manifestations we behold before our very\neyes in the sky when it is cloudless and bright. The temples of\nMinerva, Mars, and Hercules, will be Doric, since the virile strength of\nthese gods makes daintiness entirely inappropriate to their houses. In\ntemples to Venus, Flora, Proserpine, Spring-Water, and the Nymphs, the\nCorinthian order will be found to have peculiar significance, because\nthese are delicate divinities and so its rather slender outlines, its\nflowers, leaves, and ornamental volutes will lend propriety where it is\ndue. The construction of temples of the Ionic order to Juno, Diana,\nFather Bacchus, and the other gods of that kind, will be in keeping with\nthe middle position which they hold; for the building of such will be an\nappropriate combination of the severity of the Doric and the delicacy of\nthe Corinthian.\n6. Propriety arises from usage when buildings having magnificent\ninteriors are provided with elegant entrance-courts to correspond; for\nthere will be no propriety in the spectacle of an elegant interior\napproached by a low, mean entrance. Or, if dentils be carved in the\ncornice of the Doric entablature or triglyphs represented in the Ionic\nentablature over the cushion-shaped capitals of the columns, the effect\nwill be spoilt by the transfer of the peculiarities of the one order of\nbuilding to the other, the usage in each class having been fixed long\nago.\n7. Finally, propriety will be due to natural causes if, for example, in\nthe case of all sacred precincts we select very healthy neighbourhoods\nwith suitable springs of water in the places where the fanes are to be\nbuilt, particularly in the case of those to Aesculapius and to Health,\ngods by whose healing powers great numbers of the sick are apparently\ncured. For when their diseased bodies are transferred from an unhealthy\nto a healthy spot, and treated with waters from health-giving springs,\nthey will the more speedily grow well. The result will be that the\ndivinity will stand in higher esteem and find his dignity increased, all\nowing to the nature of his site. There will also be natural propriety in\nusing an eastern light for bedrooms and libraries, a western light in\nwinter for baths and winter apartments, and a northern light for picture\ngalleries and other places in which a steady light is needed; for that\nquarter of the sky grows neither light nor dark with the course of the\nsun, but remains steady and unshifting all day long.\n8. Economy denotes the proper management of materials and of site, as\nwell as a thrifty balancing of cost and common sense in the construction\nof works. This will be observed if, in the first place, the architect\ndoes not demand things which cannot be found or made ready without great\nexpense. For example: it is not everywhere that there is plenty of\npitsand, rubble, fir, clear fir, and marble, since they are produced in\ndifferent places and to assemble them is difficult and costly. Where\nthere is no pitsand, we must use the kinds washed up by rivers or by the\nsea; the lack of fir and clear fir may be evaded by using cypress,\npoplar, elm, or pine; and other problems we must solve in similar ways.\n9. A second stage in Economy is reached when we have to plan the\ndifferent kinds of dwellings suitable for ordinary householders, for\ngreat wealth, or for the high position of the statesman. A house in town\nobviously calls for one form of construction; that into which stream the\nproducts of country estates requires another; this will not be the same\nin the case of money-lenders and still different for the opulent and\nluxurious; for the powers under whose deliberations the commonwealth is\nguided dwellings are to be provided according to their special needs:\nand, in a word, the proper form of economy must be observed in building\nhouses for each and every class.\nCHAPTER III\nTHE DEPARTMENTS OF ARCHITECTURE\n1. There are three departments of architecture: the art of building, the\nmaking of timepieces, and the construction of machinery. Building is, in\nits turn, divided into two parts, of which the first is the construction\nof fortified towns and of works for general use in public places, and\nthe second is the putting up of structures for private individuals.\nThere are three classes of public buildings: the first for defensive,\nthe second for religious, and the third for utilitarian purposes. Under\ndefence comes the planning of walls, towers, and gates, permanent\ndevices for resistance against hostile attacks; under religion, the\nerection of fanes and temples to the immortal gods; under utility, the\nprovision of meeting places for public use, such as harbours, markets,\ncolonnades, baths, theatres, promenades, and all other similar\narrangements in public places.\n2. All these must be built with due reference to durability,\nconvenience, and beauty. Durability will be assured when foundations are\ncarried down to the solid ground and materials wisely and liberally\nselected; convenience, when the arrangement of the apartments is\nfaultless and presents no hindrance to use, and when each class of\nbuilding is assigned to its suitable and appropriate exposure; and\nbeauty, when the appearance of the work is pleasing and in good taste,\nand when its members are in due proportion according to correct\nprinciples of symmetry.\nCHAPTER IV\nTHE SITE OF A CITY\n1. For fortified towns the following general principles are to be\nobserved. First comes the choice of a very healthy site. Such a site\nwill be high, neither misty nor frosty, and in a climate neither hot nor\ncold, but temperate; further, without marshes in the neighbourhood. For\nwhen the morning breezes blow toward the town at sunrise, if they bring\nwith them mists from marshes and, mingled with the mist, the poisonous\nbreath of the creatures of the marshes to be wafted into the bodies of\nthe inhabitants, they will make the site unhealthy. Again, if the town\nis on the coast with a southern or western exposure, it will not be\nhealthy, because in summer the southern sky grows hot at sunrise and is\nfiery at noon, while a western exposure grows warm after sunrise, is hot\nat noon, and at evening all aglow.\n2. These variations in heat and the subsequent cooling off are harmful\nto the people living on such sites. The same conclusion may be reached\nin the case of inanimate things. For instance, nobody draws the light\nfor covered wine rooms from the south or west, but rather from the\nnorth, since that quarter is never subject to change but is always\nconstant and unshifting. So it is with granaries: grain exposed to the\nsun's course soon loses its good quality, and provisions and fruit,\nunless stored in a place unexposed to the sun's course, do not keep\nlong.\n3. For heat is a universal solvent, melting out of things their power of\nresistance, and sucking away and removing their natural strength with\nits fiery exhalations so that they grow soft, and hence weak, under its\nglow. We see this in the case of iron which, however hard it may\nnaturally be, yet when heated thoroughly in a furnace fire can be easily\nworked into any kind of shape, and still, if cooled while it is soft and\nwhite hot, it hardens again with a mere dip into cold water and takes on\nits former quality.\n4. We may also recognize the truth of this from the fact that in summer\nthe heat makes everybody weak, not only in unhealthy but even in healthy\nplaces, and that in winter even the most unhealthy districts are much\nhealthier because they are given a solidity by the cooling off.\nSimilarly, persons removed from cold countries to hot cannot endure it\nbut waste away; whereas those who pass from hot places to the cold\nregions of the north, not only do not suffer in health from the change\nof residence but even gain by it.\n5. It appears, then, that in founding towns we must beware of districts\nfrom which hot winds can spread abroad over the inhabitants. For while\nall bodies are composed of the four elements (in Greek [Greek:\nstoicheia]), that is, of heat, moisture, the earthy, and air, yet there\nare mixtures according to natural temperament which make up the natures\nof all the different animals of the world, each after its kind.\n6. Therefore, if one of these elements, heat, becomes predominant in any\nbody whatsoever, it destroys and dissolves all the others with its\nviolence. This defect may be due to violent heat from certain quarters\nof the sky, pouring into the open pores in too great proportion to admit\nof a mixture suited to the natural temperament of the body in question.\nAgain, if too much moisture enters the channels of a body, and thus\nintroduces disproportion, the other elements, adulterated by the liquid,\nare impaired, and the virtues of the mixture dissolved. This defect, in\nturn, may arise from the cooling properties of moist winds and breezes\nblowing upon the body. In the same way, increase or diminution of the\nproportion of air or of the earthy which is natural to the body may\nenfeeble the other elements; the predominance of the earthy being due to\novermuch food, that of air to a heavy atmosphere.\n7. If one wishes a more accurate understanding of all this, he need only\nconsider and observe the natures of birds, fishes, and land animals, and\nhe will thus come to reflect upon distinctions of temperament. One form\nof mixture is proper to birds, another to fishes, and a far different\nform to land animals. Winged creatures have less of the earthy, less\nmoisture, heat in moderation, air in large amount. Being made up,\ntherefore, of the lighter elements, they can more readily soar away into\nthe air. Fish, with their aquatic nature, being moderately supplied with\nheat and made up in great part of air and the earthy, with as little of\nmoisture as possible, can more easily exist in moisture for the very\nreason that they have less of it than of the other elements in their\nbodies; and so, when they are drawn to land, they leave life and water\nat the same moment. Similarly, the land animals, being moderately\nsupplied with the elements of air and heat, and having less of the\nearthy and a great deal of moisture, cannot long continue alive in the\nwater, because their portion of moisture is already abundant.\n8. Therefore, if all this is as we have explained, our reason showing us\nthat the bodies of animals are made up of the elements, and these\nbodies, as we believe, giving way and breaking up as a result of excess\nor deficiency in this or that element, we cannot but believe that we\nmust take great care to select a very temperate climate for the site of\nour city, since healthfulness is, as we have said, the first requisite.\n9. I cannot too strongly insist upon the need of a return to the method\nof old times. Our ancestors, when about to build a town or an army post,\nsacrificed some of the cattle that were wont to feed on the site\nproposed and examined their livers. If the livers of the first victims\nwere dark-coloured or abnormal, they sacrificed others, to see whether\nthe fault was due to disease or their food. They never began to build\ndefensive works in a place until after they had made many such trials\nand satisfied themselves that good water and food had made the liver\nsound and firm. If they continued to find it abnormal, they argued from\nthis that the food and water supply found in such a place would be just\nas unhealthy for man, and so they moved away and changed to another\nneighbourhood, healthfulness being their chief object.\n10. That pasturage and food may indicate the healthful qualities of a\nsite is a fact which can be observed and investigated in the case of\ncertain pastures in Crete, on each side of the river Pothereus, which\nseparates the two Cretan states of Gnosus and Gortyna. There are cattle\nat pasture on the right and left banks of that river, but while the\ncattle that feed near Gnosus have the usual spleen, those on the other\nside near Gortyna have no perceptible spleen. On investigating the\nsubject, physicians discovered on this side a kind of herb which the\ncattle chew and thus make their spleen small. The herb is therefore\ngathered and used as a medicine for the cure of splenetic people. The\nCretans call it [Greek: haspl\u00eanon]. From food and water, then, we may\nlearn whether sites are naturally unhealthy or healthy.\n11. If the walled town is built among the marshes themselves, provided\nthey are by the sea, with a northern or north-eastern exposure, and are\nabove the level of the seashore, the site will be reasonable enough. For\nditches can be dug to let out the water to the shore, and also in times\nof storms the sea swells and comes backing up into the marshes, where\nits bitter blend prevents the reproductions of the usual marsh\ncreatures, while any that swim down from the higher levels to the shore\nare killed at once by the saltness to which they are unused. An instance\nof this may be found in the Gallic marshes surrounding Altino, Ravenna,\nAquileia, and other towns in places of the kind, close by marshes. They\nare marvellously healthy, for the reasons which I have given.\n12. But marshes that are stagnant and have no outlets either by rivers\nor ditches, like the Pomptine marshes, merely putrefy as they stand,\nemitting heavy, unhealthy vapours. A case of a town built in such a spot\nwas Old Salpia in Apulia, founded by Diomede on his way back from Troy,\nor, according to some writers, by Elpias of Rhodes. Year after year\nthere was sickness, until finally the suffering inhabitants came with a\npublic petition to Marcus Hostilius and got him to agree to seek and\nfind them a proper place to which to remove their city. Without delay he\nmade the most skilful investigations, and at once purchased an estate\nnear the sea in a healthy place, and asked the Senate and Roman people\nfor permission to remove the town. He constructed the walls and laid out\nthe house lots, granting one to each citizen for a mere trifle. This\ndone, he cut an opening from a lake into the sea, and thus made of the\nlake a harbour for the town. The result is that now the people of Salpia\nlive on a healthy site and at a distance of only four miles from the old\ntown.\nCHAPTER V\nTHE CITY WALLS\n1. After insuring on these principles the healthfulness of the future\ncity, and selecting a neighbourhood that can supply plenty of food\nstuffs to maintain the community, with good roads or else convenient\nrivers or seaports affording easy means of transport to the city, the\nnext thing to do is to lay the foundations for the towers and walls. Dig\ndown to solid bottom, if it can be found, and lay them therein, going as\ndeep as the magnitude of the proposed work seems to require. They should\nbe much thicker than the part of the walls that will appear above\nground, and their structure should be as solid as it can possibly be\nlaid.\n2. The towers must be projected beyond the line of wall, so that an\nenemy wishing to approach the wall to carry it by assault may be exposed\nto the fire of missiles on his open flank from the towers on his right\nand left. Special pains should be taken that there be no easy avenue by\nwhich to storm the wall. The roads should be encompassed at steep\npoints, and planned so as to approach the gates, not in a straight line,\nbut from the right to the left; for as a result of this, the right hand\nside of the assailants, unprotected by their shields, will be next the\nwall. Towns should be laid out not as an exact square nor with salient\nangles, but in circular form, to give a view of the enemy from many\npoints. Defence is difficult where there are salient angles, because the\nangle protects the enemy rather than the inhabitants.\n3. The thickness of the wall should, in my opinion, be such that armed\nmen meeting on top of it may pass one another without interference. In\nthe thickness there should be set a very close succession of ties made\nof charred olive wood, binding the two faces of the wall together like\npins, to give it lasting endurance. For that is a material which neither\ndecay, nor the weather, nor time can harm, but even though buried in the\nearth or set in the water it keeps sound and useful forever. And so not\nonly city walls but substructures in general and all walls that require\na thickness like that of a city wall, will be long in falling to decay\nif tied in this manner.\n4. The towers should be set at intervals of not more than a bowshot\napart, so that in case of an assault upon any one of them, the enemy may\nbe repulsed with scorpiones and other means of hurling missiles from the\ntowers to the right and left. Opposite the inner side of every tower the\nwall should be interrupted for a space the width of the tower, and have\nonly a wooden flooring across, leading to the interior of the tower but\nnot firmly nailed. This is to be cut away by the defenders in case the\nenemy gets possession of any portion of the wall; and if the work is\nquickly done, the enemy will not be able to make his way to the other\ntowers and the rest of the wall unless he is ready to face a fall.\n5. The towers themselves must be either round or polygonal. Square\ntowers are sooner shattered by military engines, for the battering rams\npound their angles to pieces; but in the case of round towers they can\ndo no harm, being engaged, as it were, in driving wedges to their\ncentre. The system of fortification by wall and towers may be made\nsafest by the addition of earthen ramparts, for neither rams, nor\nmining, nor other engineering devices can do them any harm.\n[Illustration: CONSTRUCTION OF CITY WALLS\n(From the edition of Vitruvius by Fra Giocondo, Venice, 1511)]\n6. The rampart form of defence, however, is not required in all places,\nbut only where outside the wall there is high ground from which an\nassault on the fortifications may be made over a level space lying\nbetween. In places of this kind we must first make very wide, deep\nditches; next sink foundations for a wall in the bed of the ditch and\nbuild them thick enough to support an earth-work with ease.\n7. Then within this substructure lay a second foundation, far enough\ninside the first to leave ample room for cohorts in line of battle to\ntake position on the broad top of the rampart for its defence. Having\nlaid these two foundations at this distance from one another, build\ncross walls between them, uniting the outer and inner foundation, in a\ncomb-like arrangement, set like the teeth of a saw. With this form of\nconstruction, the enormous burden of earth will be distributed into\nsmall bodies, and will not lie with all its weight in one crushing mass\nso as to thrust out the substructures.\n8. With regard to the material of which the actual wall should be\nconstructed or finished, there can be no definite prescription, because\nwe cannot obtain in all places the supplies that we desire. Dimension\nstone, flint, rubble, burnt or unburnt brick,--use them as you find\nthem. For it is not every neighbourhood or particular locality that can\nhave a wall built of burnt brick like that at Babylon, where there was\nplenty of asphalt to take the place of lime and sand, and yet possibly\neach may be provided with materials of equal usefulness so that out of\nthem a faultless wall may be built to last forever.\nCHAPTER VI\nTHE DIRECTIONS OF THE STREETS; WITH REMARKS ON THE WINDS\n1. The town being fortified, the next step is the apportionment of house\nlots within the wall and the laying out of streets and alleys with\nregard to climatic conditions. They will be properly laid out if\nforesight is employed to exclude the winds from the alleys. Cold winds\nare disagreeable, hot winds enervating, moist winds unhealthy. We must,\ntherefore, avoid mistakes in this matter and beware of the common\nexperience of many communities. For example, Mytilene in the island of\nLesbos is a town built with magnificence and good taste, but its\nposition shows a lack of foresight. In that community when the wind is\nsouth, the people fall ill; when it is northwest, it sets them coughing;\nwith a north wind they do indeed recover but cannot stand about in the\nalleys and streets, owing to the severe cold.\n2. Wind is a flowing wave of air, moving hither and thither\nindefinitely. It is produced when heat meets moisture, the rush of heat\ngenerating a mighty current of air. That this is the fact we may learn\nfrom bronze eolipiles, and thus by means of a scientific invention\ndiscover a divine truth lurking in the laws of the heavens. Eolipiles\nare hollow bronze balls, with a very small opening through which water\nis poured into them. Set before a fire, not a breath issues from them\nbefore they get warm; but as soon as they begin to boil, out comes a\nstrong blast due to the fire. Thus from this slight and very short\nexperiment we may understand and judge of the mighty and wonderful laws\nof the heavens and the nature of winds.\n3. By shutting out the winds from our dwellings, therefore, we shall not\nonly make the place healthful for people who are well, but also in the\ncase of diseases due perhaps to unfavourable situations elsewhere, the\npatients, who in other healthy places might be cured by a different form\nof treatment, will here be more quickly cured by the mildness that comes\nfrom the shutting out of the winds. The diseases which are hard to cure\nin neighbourhoods such as those to which I have referred above are\ncatarrh, hoarseness, coughs, pleurisy, consumption, spitting of blood,\nand all others that are cured not by lowering the system but by building\nit up. They are hard to cure, first, because they are originally due to\nchills; secondly, because the patient's system being already exhausted\nby disease, the air there, which is in constant agitation owing to winds\nand therefore deteriorated, takes all the sap of life out of their\ndiseased bodies and leaves them more meagre every day. On the other\nhand, a mild, thick air, without draughts and not constantly blowing\nback and forth, builds up their frames by its unwavering steadiness, and\nso strengthens and restores people who are afflicted with these\ndiseases.\n4. Some have held that there are only four winds: Solanus from due east;\nAuster from the south; Favonius from due west; Septentrio from the\nnorth. But more careful investigators tell us that there are eight.\nChief among such was Andronicus of Cyrrhus who in proof built the marble\noctagonal tower in Athens. On the several sides of the octagon he\nexecuted reliefs representing the several winds, each facing the point\nfrom which it blows; and on top of the tower he set a conical shaped\npiece of marble and on this a bronze Triton with a rod outstretched in\nits right hand. It was so contrived as to go round with the wind, always\nstopping to face the breeze and holding its rod as a pointer directly\nover the representation of the wind that was blowing.\n5. Thus Eurus is placed to the southeast between Solanus and Auster:\nAfricus to the southwest between Auster and Favonius; Caurus, or, as\nmany call it, Corus, between Favonius and Septentrio; and Aquilo between\nSeptentrio and Solanus. Such, then, appears to have been his device,\nincluding the numbers and names of the wind and indicating the\ndirections from which particular winds blow. These facts being thus\ndetermined, to find the directions and quarters of the winds your method\nof procedure should be as follows.\n6. In the middle of the city place a marble amussium, laying it true by\nthe level, or else let the spot be made so true by means of rule and\nlevel that no amussium is necessary. In the very centre of that spot set\nup a bronze gnomon or \"shadow tracker\" (in Greek [Greek: skiath\u00earas]).\nAt about the fifth hour in the morning, take the end of the shadow cast\nby this gnomon, and mark it with a point. Then, opening your compasses\nto this point which marks the length of the gnomon's shadow, describe a\ncircle from the centre. In the afternoon watch the shadow of your gnomon\nas it lengthens, and when it once more touches the circumference of\nthis circle and the shadow in the afternoon is equal in length to\nthat of the morning, mark it with a point.\n[Illustration: THE TOWER OF THE WINDS AT ATHENS]\n7. From these two points describe with your compasses intersecting arcs,\nand through their intersection and the centre let a line be drawn to the\ncircumference of the circle to give us the quarters of south and north.\nThen, using a sixteenth part of the entire circumference of the circle\nas a diameter, describe a circle with its centre on the line to the\nsouth, at the point where it crosses the circumference, and put points\nto the right and left on the circumference on the south side, repeating\nthe process on the north side. From the four points thus obtained draw\nlines intersecting the centre from one side of the circumference to the\nother. Thus we shall have an eighth part of the circumference set out\nfor Auster and another for Septentrio. The rest of the entire\ncircumference is then to be divided into three equal parts on each side,\nand thus we have designed a figure equally apportioned among the eight\nwinds. Then let the directions of your streets and alleys be laid down\non the lines of division between the quarters of two winds.\n8. On this principle of arrangement the disagreeable force of the winds\nwill be shut out from dwellings and lines of houses. For if the streets\nrun full in the face of the winds, their constant blasts rushing in from\nthe open country, and then confined by narrow alleys, will sweep through\nthem with great violence. The lines of houses must therefore be directed\naway from the quarters from which the winds blow, so that as they come\nin they may strike against the angles of the blocks and their force thus\nbe broken and dispersed.\n9. Those who know names for very many winds will perhaps be surprised at\nour setting forth that there are only eight. Remembering, however, that\nEratosthenes of Cyrene, employing mathematical theories and geometrical\nmethods, discovered from the course of the sun, the shadows cast by an\nequinoctial gnomon, and the inclination of the heaven that the\ncircumference of the earth is two hundred and fifty-two thousand stadia,\nthat is, thirty-one one million five hundred thousand paces, and\nobserving that an eighth part of this, occupied by a wind, is three\nmillion nine hundred and thirty-seven thousand five hundred paces, they\nshould not be surprised to find that a single wind, ranging over so wide\na field, is subject to shifts this way and that, leading to a variety of\nbreezes.\n10. So we often have Leuconotus and Altanus blowing respectively to the\nright and left of Auster; Libonotus and Subvesperus to the right and\nleft of Africus; Argestes, and at certain periods the Etesiae, on either\nside of Favonius; Circias and Corus on the sides of Caurus; Thracias and\nGallicus on either side of Septentrio; Supernas and Caecias to the right\nand left of Aquilo; Carbas, and at a certain period the Ornithiae, on\neither side of Solanus; while Eurocircias and Volturnus blow on the\nflanks of Eurus which is between them. There are also many other names\nfor winds derived from localities or from the squalls which sweep from\nrivers or down mountains.\n11. Then, too, there are the breezes of early morning; for the sun on\nemerging from beneath the earth strikes humid air as he returns, and as\nhe goes climbing up the sky he spreads it out before him, extracting\nbreezes from the vapour that was there before the dawn. Those that still\nblow on after sunrise are classed with Eurus, and hence appears to come\nthe Greek name [Greek: euros] as the child of the breezes, and the word\nfor \"to-morrow,\" [Greek: aurion], named from the early morning breezes.\nSome people do indeed say that Eratosthenes could not have inferred the\ntrue measure of the earth. Whether true or untrue, it cannot affect the\ntruth of what I have written on the fixing of the quarters from which\nthe different winds blow.\n[Illustration: DIAGRAM OF THE WINDS (From the edition of Vitruvius by\nFra Giocondo, Venice, 1511)]\n12. If he was wrong, the only result will be that the individual winds\nmay blow, not with the scope expected from his measurement, but with\npowers either more or less widely extended. For the readier\nunderstanding of these topics, since I have treated them with brevity,\nit has seemed best to me to give two figures, or, as the Greeks say,\n[Greek: sch\u00eamata], at the end of this book: one designed to show the\nprecise quarters from which the winds arise; the other, how by turning\nthe directions of the rows of houses and the streets away from their\nfull force, we may avoid unhealthy blasts. Let A be the centre of a\nplane surface, and B the point to which the shadow of the gnomon reaches\nin the morning. Taking A as the centre, open the compasses to the point\nB, which marks the shadow, and describe a circle. Put the gnomon back\nwhere it was before and wait for the shadow to lessen and grow again\nuntil in the afternoon it is equal to its length in the morning,\ntouching the circumference at the point C. Then from the points B and C\ndescribe with the compasses two arcs intersecting at D. Next draw a line\nfrom the point of intersection D through the centre of the circle to the\ncircumference and call it E F. This line will show where the south and\nnorth lie.\n[Illustration]\n13. Then find with the compasses a sixteenth part of the entire\ncircumference; then centre the compasses on the point E where the line\nto the south touches the circumference, and set off the points G and H\nto the right and left of E. Likewise on the north side, centre the\ncompasses on the circumference at the point F on the line to the north,\nand set off the points I and K to the right and left; then draw lines\nthrough the centre from G to K and from H to I. Thus the space from G to\nH will belong to Auster and the south, and the space from I to K will be\nthat of Septentrio. The rest of the circumference is to be divided\nequally into three parts on the right and three on the left, those to\nthe east at the points L and M, those to the west at the points N and\nO. Finally, intersecting lines are to be drawn from M to O and from L\nto N. Thus we shall have the circumference divided into eight equal\nspaces for the winds. The figure being finished, we shall have at the\neight different divisions, beginning at the south, the letter G between\nEurus and Auster, H between Auster and Africus, N between Africus and\nFavonius, O between Favonius and Caurus, K between Caurus and\nSeptentrio, I between Septentrio and Aquilo, L between Aquilo and\nSolanus, and M between Solanus and Eurus. This done, apply a gnomon to\nthese eight divisions and thus fix the directions of the different\nalleys.\nCHAPTER VII\nTHE SITES FOR PUBLIC BUILDINGS\n1. Having laid out the alleys and determined the streets, we have next\nto treat of the choice of building sites for temples, the forum, and all\nother public places, with a view to general convenience and utility. If\nthe city is on the sea, we should choose ground close to the harbour as\nthe place where the forum is to be built; but if inland, in the middle\nof the town. For the temples, the sites for those of the gods under\nwhose particular protection the state is thought to rest and for\nJupiter, Juno, and Minerva, should be on the very highest point\ncommanding a view of the greater part of the city. Mercury should be in\nthe forum, or, like Isis and Serapis, in the emporium: Apollo and Father\nBacchus near the theatre: Hercules at the circus in communities which\nhave no gymnasia nor amphitheatres; Mars outside the city but at the\ntraining ground, and so Venus, but at the harbour. It is moreover shown\nby the Etruscan diviners in treatises on their science that the fanes of\nVenus, Vulcan, and Mars should be situated outside the walls, in order\nthat the young men and married women may not become habituated in the\ncity to the temptations incident to the worship of Venus, and that\nbuildings may be free from the terror of fires through the religious\nrites and sacrifices which call the power of Vulcan beyond the walls.\nAs for Mars, when that divinity is enshrined outside the walls, the\ncitizens will never take up arms against each other, and he will defend\nthe city from its enemies and save it from danger in war.\n2. Ceres also should be outside the city in a place to which people need\nnever go except for the purpose of sacrifice. That place should be under\nthe protection of religion, purity, and good morals. Proper sites should\nbe set apart for the precincts of the other gods according to the nature\nof the sacrifices offered to them.\nThe principle governing the actual construction of temples and their\nsymmetry I shall explain in my third and fourth books. In the second I\nhave thought it best to give an account of the materials used in\nbuildings with their good qualities and advantages, and then in the\nsucceeding books to describe and explain the proportions of buildings,\ntheir arrangements, and the different forms of symmetry.\nBOOK II\nINTRODUCTION\n1. Dinocrates, an architect who was full of confidence in his own ideas\nand skill, set out from Macedonia, in the reign of Alexander, to go to\nthe army, being eager to win the approbation of the king. He took with\nhim from his country letters from relatives and friends to the principal\nmilitary men and officers of the court, in order to gain access to them\nmore readily. Being politely received by them, he asked to be presented\nto Alexander as soon as possible. They promised, but were rather slow,\nwaiting for a suitable opportunity. So Dinocrates, thinking that they\nwere playing with him, had recourse to his own efforts. He was of very\nlofty stature and pleasing countenance, finely formed, and extremely\ndignified. Trusting, therefore, to these natural gifts, he undressed\nhimself in his inn, anointed his body with oil, set a chaplet of poplar\nleaves on his head, draped his left shoulder with a lion's skin, and\nholding a club in his right hand stalked forth to a place in front of\nthe tribunal where the king was administering justice.\n2. His strange appearance made the people turn round, and this led\nAlexander to look at him. In astonishment he gave orders to make way for\nhim to draw near, and asked who he was. \"Dinocrates,\" quoth he, \"a\nMacedonian architect, who brings thee ideas and designs worthy of thy\nrenown. I have made a design for the shaping of Mount Athos into the\nstatue of a man, in whose left hand I have represented a very spacious\nfortified city, and in his right a bowl to receive the water of all the\nstreams which are in that mountain, so that it may pour from the bowl\ninto the sea.\"\n3. Alexander, delighted with the idea of his design, immediately\ninquired whether there were any fields in the neighbourhood that could\nmaintain the city in corn. On finding that this was impossible without\ntransport from beyond the sea, \"Dinocrates,\" quoth he, \"I appreciate\nyour design as excellent in composition, and I am delighted with it, but\nI apprehend that anybody who should found a city in that spot would be\ncensured for bad judgement. For as a newborn babe cannot be nourished\nwithout the nurse's milk, nor conducted to the approaches that lead to\ngrowth in life, so a city cannot thrive without fields and the fruits\nthereof pouring into its walls, nor have a large population without\nplenty of food, nor maintain its population without a supply of it.\nTherefore, while thinking that your design is commendable, I consider\nthe site as not commendable; but I would have you stay with me, because\nI mean to make use of your services.\"\n4. From that time, Dinocrates did not leave the king, but followed him\ninto Egypt. There Alexander, observing a harbour rendered safe by\nnature, an excellent centre for trade, cornfields throughout all Egypt,\nand the great usefulness of the mighty river Nile, ordered him to build\nthe city of Alexandria, named after the king. This was how Dinocrates,\nrecommended only by his good looks and dignified carriage, came to be so\nfamous. But as for me, Emperor, nature has not given me stature, age has\nmarred my face, and my strength is impaired by ill health. Therefore,\nsince these advantages fail me, I shall win your approval, as I hope, by\nthe help of my knowledge and my writings.\n5. In my first book, I have said what I had to say about the functions\nof architecture and the scope of the art, as well as about fortified\ntowns and the apportionment of building sites within the fortifications.\nAlthough it would next be in order to explain the proper proportions and\nsymmetry of temples and public buildings, as well as of private houses,\nI thought best to postpone this until after I had treated the practical\nmerits of the materials out of which, when they are brought together,\nbuildings are constructed with due regard to the proper kind of material\nfor each part, and until I had shown of what natural elements those\nmaterials are composed. But before beginning to explain their natural\nproperties, I will prefix the motives which originally gave rise to\nbuildings and the development of inventions in this field, following in\nthe steps of early nature and of those writers who have devoted\ntreatises to the origins of civilization and the investigation of\ninventions. My exposition will, therefore, follow the instruction which\nI have received from them.\nCHAPTER I\nTHE ORIGIN OF THE DWELLING HOUSE\n1. The men of old were born like the wild beasts, in woods, caves, and\ngroves, and lived on savage fare. As time went on, the thickly crowded\ntrees in a certain place, tossed by storms and winds, and rubbing their\nbranches against one another, caught fire, and so the inhabitants of the\nplace were put to flight, being terrified by the furious flame. After it\nsubsided, they drew near, and observing that they were very comfortable\nstanding before the warm fire, they put on logs and, while thus keeping\nit alive, brought up other people to it, showing them by signs how much\ncomfort they got from it. In that gathering of men, at a time when\nutterance of sound was purely individual, from daily habits they fixed\nupon articulate words just as these had happened to come; then, from\nindicating by name things in common use, the result was that in this\nchance way they began to talk, and thus originated conversation with one\nanother.\n2. Therefore it was the discovery of fire that originally gave rise to\nthe coming together of men, to the deliberative assembly, and to social\nintercourse. And so, as they kept coming together in greater numbers\ninto one place, finding themselves naturally gifted beyond the other\nanimals in not being obliged to walk with faces to the ground, but\nupright and gazing upon the splendour of the starry firmament, and also\nin being able to do with ease whatever they chose with their hands and\nfingers, they began in that first assembly to construct shelters. Some\nmade them of green boughs, others dug caves on mountain sides, and some,\nin imitation of the nests of swallows and the way they built, made\nplaces of refuge out of mud and twigs. Next, by observing the shelters\nof others and adding new details to their own inceptions, they\nconstructed better and better kinds of huts as time went on.\n3. And since they were of an imitative and teachable nature, they would\ndaily point out to each other the results of their building, boasting of\nthe novelties in it; and thus, with their natural gifts sharpened by\nemulation, their standards improved daily. At first they set up forked\nstakes connected by twigs and covered these walls with mud. Others made\nwalls of lumps of dried mud, covering them with reeds and leaves to keep\nout the rain and the heat. Finding that such roofs could not stand the\nrain during the storms of winter, they built them with peaks daubed with\nmud, the roofs sloping and projecting so as to carry off the rain water.\n4. That houses originated as I have written above, we can see for\nourselves from the buildings that are to this day constructed of like\nmaterials by foreign tribes: for instance, in Gaul, Spain, Portugal, and\nAquitaine, roofed with oak shingles or thatched. Among the Colchians in\nPontus, where there are forests in plenty, they lay down entire trees\nflat on the ground to the right and the left, leaving between them a\nspace to suit the length of the trees, and then place above these\nanother pair of trees, resting on the ends of the former and at right\nangles with them. These four trees enclose the space for the dwelling.\nThen upon these they place sticks of timber, one after the other on the\nfour sides, crossing each other at the angles, and so, proceeding with\ntheir walls of trees laid perpendicularly above the lowest, they build\nup high towers. The interstices, which are left on account of the\nthickness of the building material, are stopped up with chips and mud.\nAs for the roofs, by cutting away the ends of the crossbeams and making\nthem converge gradually as they lay them across, they bring them up to\nthe top from the four sides in the shape of a pyramid. They cover it\nwith leaves and mud, and thus construct the roofs of their towers in a\nrude form of the \"tortoise\" style.\n5. On the other hand, the Phrygians, who live in an open country, have\nno forests and consequently lack timber. They therefore select a natural\nhillock, run a trench through the middle of it, dig passages, and extend\nthe interior space as widely as the site admits. Over it they build a\npyramidal roof of logs fastened together, and this they cover with reeds\nand brushwood, heaping up very high mounds of earth above their\ndwellings. Thus their fashion in houses makes their winters very warm\nand their summers very cool. Some construct hovels with roofs of rushes\nfrom the swamps. Among other nations, also, in some places there are\nhuts of the same or a similar method of construction. Likewise at\nMarseilles we can see roofs without tiles, made of earth mixed with\nstraw. In Athens on the Areopagus there is to this day a relic of\nantiquity with a mud roof. The hut of Romulus on the Capitol is a\nsignificant reminder of the fashions of old times, and likewise the\nthatched roofs of temples or the Citadel.\n6. From such specimens we can draw our inferences with regard to the\ndevices used in the buildings of antiquity, and conclude that they were\nsimilar.\nFurthermore, as men made progress by becoming daily more expert in\nbuilding, and as their ingenuity was increased by their dexterity so\nthat from habit they attained to considerable skill, their intelligence\nwas enlarged by their industry until the more proficient adopted the\ntrade of carpenters. From these early beginnings, and from the fact that\nnature had not only endowed the human race with senses like the rest of\nthe animals, but had also equipped their minds with the powers of\nthought and understanding, thus putting all other animals under their\nsway, they next gradually advanced from the construction of buildings to\nthe other arts and sciences, and so passed from a rude and barbarous\nmode of life to civilization and refinement.\n7. Then, taking courage and looking forward from the standpoint of\nhigher ideas born of the multiplication of the arts, they gave up huts\nand began to build houses with foundations, having brick or stone\nwalls, and roofs of timber and tiles; next, observation and application\nled them from fluctuating and indefinite conceptions to definite rules\nof symmetry. Perceiving that nature had been lavish in the bestowal of\ntimber and bountiful in stores of building material, they treated this\nlike careful nurses, and thus developing the refinements of life,\nembellished them with luxuries. Therefore I shall now treat, to the best\nof my ability, of the things which are suitable to be used in buildings,\nshowing their qualities and their excellencies.\n8. Some persons, however, may find fault with the position of this book,\nthinking that it should have been placed first. I will therefore explain\nthe matter, lest it be thought that I have made a mistake. Being engaged\nin writing a complete treatise on architecture, I resolved to set forth\nin the first book the branches of learning and studies of which it\nconsists, to define its departments, and to show of what it is composed.\nHence I have there declared what the qualities of an architect should\nbe. In the first book, therefore, I have spoken of the function of the\nart, but in this I shall discuss the use of the building materials which\nnature provides. For this book does not show of what architecture is\ncomposed, but treats of the origin of the building art, how it was\nfostered, and how it made progress, step by step, until it reached its\npresent perfection.\n9. This book is, therefore, in its proper order and place.\nI will now return to my subject, and with regard to the materials suited\nto the construction of buildings will consider their natural formation\nand in what proportions their elementary constituents were combined,\nmaking it all clear and not obscure to my readers. For there is no kind\nof material, no body, and no thing that can be produced or conceived of,\nwhich is not made up of elementary particles; and nature does not admit\nof a truthful exploration in accordance with the doctrines of the\nphysicists without an accurate demonstration of the primary causes of\nthings, showing how and why they are as they are.\nCHAPTER II\nON THE PRIMORDIAL SUBSTANCE ACCORDING TO THE PHYSICISTS\n1. First of all Thales thought that water was the primordial substance\nof all things. Heraclitus of Ephesus, surnamed by the Greeks [Greek:\nskoteinos] on account of the obscurity of his writings, thought that it\nwas fire. Democritus and his follower Epicurus thought that it was the\natoms, termed by our writers \"bodies that cannot be cut up,\" or, by\nsome, \"indivisibles.\" The school of the Pythagoreans added air and the\nearthy to the water and fire. Hence, although Democritus did not in a\nstrict sense name them, but spoke only of indivisible bodies, yet he\nseems to have meant these same elements, because when taken by\nthemselves they cannot be harmed, nor are they susceptible of\ndissolution, nor can they be cut up into parts, but throughout time\neternal they forever retain an infinite solidity.\n2. All things therefore appear to be made up and produced by the coming\ntogether of these elements, so that they have been distributed by nature\namong an infinite number of kinds of things. Hence I believed it right\nto treat of the diversity and practical peculiarities of these things as\nwell as of the qualities which they exhibit in buildings, so that\npersons who are intending to build may understand them and so make no\nmistake, but may gather materials which are suitable to use in their\nbuildings.\nCHAPTER III\nBRICK\n1. Beginning with bricks, I shall state of what kind of clay they ought\nto be made. They should not be made of sandy or pebbly clay, or of fine\ngravel, because when made of these kinds they are in the first place\nheavy; and, secondly, when washed by the rain as they stand in walls,\nthey go to pieces and break up, and the straw in them does not hold\ntogether on account of the roughness of the material. They should rather\nbe made of white and chalky or of red clay, or even of a coarse grained\ngravelly clay. These materials are smooth and therefore durable; they\nare not heavy to work with, and are readily laid.\n2. Bricks should be made in Spring or Autumn, so that they may dry\nuniformly. Those made in Summer are defective, because the fierce heat\nof the sun bakes their surface and makes the brick seem dry while inside\nit is not dry. And so the shrinking, which follows as they dry, causes\ncracks in the parts which were dried before, and these cracks make the\nbricks weak. Bricks will be most serviceable if made two years before\nusing; for they cannot dry thoroughly in less time. When fresh undried\nbricks are used in a wall, the stucco covering stiffens and hardens into\na permanent mass, but the bricks settle and cannot keep the same height\nas the stucco; the motion caused by their shrinking prevents them from\nadhering to it, and they are separated from their union with it. Hence\nthe stucco, no longer joined to the core of the wall, cannot stand by\nitself because it is so thin; it breaks off, and the walls themselves\nmay perhaps be ruined by their settling. This is so true that at Utica\nin constructing walls they use brick only if it is dry and made five\nyears previously, and approved as such by the authority of a magistrate.\n3. There are three kinds of bricks. First, the kind called in Greek\nLydian, being that which our people use, a foot and a half long and one\nfoot wide. The other two kinds are used by the Greeks in their\nbuildings. Of these, one is called [Greek: pentad\u00f4ron], the other\n[Greek: tetrad\u00f4ron]. [Greek: D\u00f4ron] is the Greek for \"palm,\" for in\nGreek [Greek: d\u00f4ron] means the giving of gifts, and the gift is always\npresented in the palm of the hand. A brick five palms square is called\n\"pentadoron\"; one four palms square \"tetradoron.\" Public buildings are\nconstructed of [Greek: pentad\u00f4ra], private of [Greek: tetrad\u00f4ra].\n4. With these bricks there are also half-bricks. When these are used in\na wall, a course of bricks is laid on one face and a course of\nhalf-bricks on the other, and they are bedded to the line on each face.\nThe walls are bonded by alternate courses of the two different kinds,\nand as the bricks are always laid so as to break joints, this lends\nstrength and a not unattractive appearance to both sides of such walls.\n[Illustration: VITRUVIUS' BRICK-BOND ACCORDING TO REBER]\nIn the states of Maxilua and Callet, in Further Spain, as well as in\nPitane in Asia Minor, there are bricks which, when finished and dried,\nwill float on being thrown into water. The reason why they can float\nseems to be that the clay of which they are made is like pumice-stone.\nSo it is light, and also it does not, after being hardened by exposure\nto the air, take up or absorb liquid. So these bricks, being of this\nlight and porous quality, and admitting no moisture into their texture,\nmust by the laws of nature float in water, like pumice, no matter what\ntheir weight may be. They have therefore great advantages; for they are\nnot heavy to use in building and, once made, they are not spoiled by bad\nweather.\nCHAPTER IV\nSAND\n1. In walls of masonry the first question must be with regard to the\nsand, in order that it may be fit to mix into mortar and have no dirt in\nit. The kinds of pitsand are these: black, gray, red, and carbuncular.\nOf these the best will be found to be that which crackles when rubbed in\nthe hand, while that which has much dirt in it will not be sharp enough.\nAgain: throw some sand upon a white garment and then shake it out; if\nthe garment is not soiled and no dirt adheres to it, the sand is\nsuitable.\n2. But if there are no sandpits from which it can be dug, then we must\nsift it out from river beds or from gravel or even from the sea beach.\nThis kind, however, has these defects when used in masonry: it dries\nslowly; the wall cannot be built up without interruption but from time\nto time there must be pauses in the work; and such a wall cannot carry\nvaultings. Furthermore, when sea-sand is used in walls and these are\ncoated with stucco, a salty efflorescence is given out which spoils the\nsurface.\n3. But pitsand used in masonry dries quickly, the stucco coating is\npermanent, and the walls can support vaultings. I am speaking of sand\nfresh from the sandpits. For if it lies unused too long after being\ntaken out, it is disintegrated by exposure to sun, moon, or hoar frost,\nand becomes earthy. So when mixed in masonry, it has no binding power on\nthe rubble, which consequently settles and down comes the load which the\nwalls can no longer support. Fresh pitsand, however, in spite of all its\nexcellence in concrete structures, is not equally useful in stucco, the\nrichness of which, when the lime and straw are mixed with such sand,\nwill cause it to crack as it dries on account of the great strength of\nthe mixture. But river sand, though useless in \"signinum\" on account of\nits thinness, becomes perfectly solid in stucco when thoroughly worked\nby means of polishing instruments.\nCHAPTER V\nLIME\n1. Sand and its sources having been thus treated, next with regard to\nlime we must be careful that it is burned from a stone which, whether\nsoft or hard, is in any case white. Lime made of close-grained stone of\nthe harder sort will be good in structural parts; lime of porous stone,\nin stucco. After slaking it, mix your mortar, if using pitsand, in the\nproportions of three parts of sand to one of lime; if using river or\nsea-sand, mix two parts of sand with one of lime. These will be the\nright proportions for the composition of the mixture. Further, in using\nriver or sea-sand, the addition of a third part composed of burnt brick,\npounded up and sifted, will make your mortar of a better composition to\nuse.\n2. The reason why lime makes a solid structure on being combined with\nwater and sand seems to be this: that rocks, like all other bodies, are\ncomposed of the four elements. Those which contain a larger proportion\nof air, are soft; of water, are tough from the moisture; of earth, hard;\nand of fire, more brittle. Therefore, if limestone, without being\nburned, is merely pounded up small and then mixed with sand and so put\ninto the work, the mass does not solidify nor can it hold together. But\nif the stone is first thrown into the kiln, it loses its former property\nof solidity by exposure to the great heat of the fire, and so with its\nstrength burnt out and exhausted it is left with its pores open and\nempty. Hence, the moisture and air in the body of the stone being burned\nout and set free, and only a residuum of heat being left lying in it, if\nthe stone is then immersed in water, the moisture, before the water can\nfeel the influence of the fire, makes its way into the open pores; then\nthe stone begins to get hot, and finally, after it cools off, the heat\nis rejected from the body of the lime.\n3. Consequently, limestone when taken out of the kiln cannot be as heavy\nas when it was thrown in, but on being weighed, though its bulk remains\nthe same as before, it is found to have lost about a third of its weight\nowing to the boiling out of the water. Therefore, its pores being thus\nopened and its texture rendered loose, it readily mixes with sand, and\nhence the two materials cohere as they dry, unite with the rubble, and\nmake a solid structure.\nCHAPTER VI\nPOZZOLANA\n1. There is also a kind of powder which from natural causes produces\nastonishing results. It is found in the neighbourhood of Baiae and in\nthe country belonging to the towns round about Mt. Vesuvius. This\nsubstance, when mixed with lime and rubble, not only lends strength to\nbuildings of other kinds, but even when piers of it are constructed in\nthe sea, they set hard under water. The reason for this seems to be that\nthe soil on the slopes of the mountains in these neighbourhoods is hot\nand full of hot springs. This would not be so unless the mountains had\nbeneath them huge fires of burning sulphur or alum or asphalt. So the\nfire and the heat of the flames, coming up hot from far within through\nthe fissures, make the soil there light, and the tufa found there is\nspongy and free from moisture. Hence, when the three substances, all\nformed on a similar principle by the force of fire, are mixed together,\nthe water suddenly taken in makes them cohere, and the moisture quickly\nhardens them so that they set into a mass which neither the waves nor\nthe force of the water can dissolve.\n2. That there is burning heat in these regions may be proved by the\nfurther fact that in the mountains near Baiae, which belongs to the\nCumaeans, there are places excavated to serve as sweating-baths, where\nthe intense heat that comes from far below bores its way through the\nearth, owing to the force of the fire, and passing up appears in these\nregions, thus making remarkably good sweating-baths. Likewise also it is\nrelated that in ancient times the tides of heat, swelling and\noverflowing from under Mt. Vesuvius, vomited forth fire from the\nmountain upon the neighbouring country. Hence, what is called\n\"sponge-stone\" or \"Pompeian pumice\" appears to have been reduced by\nburning from another kind of stone to the condition of the kind which we\nsee.\n3. The kind of sponge-stone taken from this region is not produced\neverywhere else, but only about Aetna and among the hills of Mysia which\nthe Greeks call the \"Burnt District,\" and in other places of the same\npeculiar nature. Seeing that in such places there are found hot springs\nand warm vapour in excavations on the mountains, and that the ancients\ntell us that there were once fires spreading over the fields in those\nvery regions, it seems to be certain that moisture has been extracted\nfrom the tufa and earth, by the force of fire, just as it is from\nlimestone in kilns.\n4. Therefore, when different and unlike things have been subjected to\nthe action of fire and thus reduced to the same condition, if after\nthis, while in a warm, dry state, they are suddenly saturated with\nwater, there is an effervescence of the heat latent in the bodies of\nthem all, and this makes them firmly unite and quickly assume the\nproperty of one solid mass.\nThere will still be the question why Tuscany, although it abounds in hot\nsprings, does not furnish a powder out of which, on the same principle,\na wall can be made which will set fast under water. I have therefore\nthought best to explain how this seems to be, before the question should\nbe raised.\n5. The same kinds of soil are not found in all places and countries\nalike, nor is stone found everywhere. Some soils are earthy; others\ngravelly, and again pebbly; in other places the material is sandy; in a\nword, the properties of the soil are as different and unlike as are the\nvarious countries. In particular, it may be observed that sandpits are\nhardly ever lacking in any place within the districts of Italy and\nTuscany which are bounded by the Apennines; whereas across the Apennines\ntoward the Adriatic none are found, and in Achaea and Asia Minor or, in\nshort, across the sea, the very term is unknown. Hence it is not in all\nthe places where boiling springs of hot water abound, that there is the\nsame combination of favourable circumstances which has been described\nabove. For things are produced in accordance with the will of nature;\nnot to suit man's pleasure, but as it were by a chance distribution.\n6. Therefore, where the mountains are not earthy but consist of soft\nstone, the force of the fire, passing through the fissures in the stone,\nsets it afire. The soft and delicate part is burned out, while the hard\npart is left. Consequently, while in Campania the burning of the earth\nmakes ashes, in Tuscany the combustion of the stone makes carbuncular\nsand. Both are excellent in walls, but one is better to use for\nbuildings on land, the other for piers under salt water. The Tuscan\nstone is softer in quality than tufa but harder than earth, and being\nthoroughly kindled by the violent heat from below, the result is the\nproduction in some places of the kind of sand called carbuncular.\n[Illustration: TRAVERTINE QUARRIES ON THE ROMAN CAMPAGNA\n1. 2. Ancient quarries. 3. A similar modern quarry.\nThe top of the rock shows the original ground level. The present ground\nlevel shows the depth to which the rock has been removed.]\nCHAPTER VII\nSTONE\n1. I have now spoken of lime and sand, with their varieties and points\nof excellence. Next comes the consideration of stone-quarries from which\ndimension stone and supplies of rubble to be used in building are taken\nand brought together. The stone in quarries is found to be of different\nand unlike qualities. In some it is soft: for example, in the environs\nof the city at the quarries of Grotta Rossa, Palla, Fidenae, and of the\nAlban hills; in others, it is medium, as at Tivoli, at Amiternum, or Mt.\nSoracte, and in quarries of this sort; in still others it is hard, as in\nlava quarries. There are also numerous other kinds: for instance, in\nCampania, red and black tufas; in Umbria, Picenum, and Venetia, white\ntufa which can be cut with a toothed saw, like wood.\n2. All these soft kinds have the advantage that they can be easily\nworked as soon as they have been taken from the quarries. Under cover\nthey play their part well; but in open and exposed situations the frost\nand rime make them crumble, and they go to pieces. On the seacoast, too,\nthe salt eats away and dissolves them, nor can they stand great heat\neither. But travertine and all stone of that class can stand injury\nwhether from a heavy load laid upon it or from the weather; exposure to\nfire, however, it cannot bear, but splits and cracks to pieces at once.\nThis is because in its natural composition there is but little moisture\nand not much of the earthy, but a great deal of air and of fire.\nTherefore, it is not only without the earthy and watery elements, but\nwhen fire, expelling the air from it by the operation and force of heat,\npenetrates into its inmost parts and occupies the empty spaces of the\nfissures, there comes a great glow and the stone is made to burn as\nfiercely as do the particles of fire itself.\n3. There are also several quarries called Anician in the territory of\nTarquinii, the stone being of the colour of peperino. The principal\nworkshops lie round the lake of Bolsena and in the prefecture of\nStatonia. This stone has innumerable good qualities. Neither the season\nof frost nor exposure to fire can harm it, but it remains solid and\nlasts to a great age, because there is only a little air and fire in its\nnatural composition, a moderate amount of moisture, and a great deal of\nthe earthy. Hence its structure is of close texture and solid, and so it\ncannot be injured by the weather or by the force of fire.\n4. This may best be seen from monuments in the neighbourhood of the town\nof Ferento which are made of stone from these quarries. Among them are\nlarge statues exceedingly well made, images of smaller size, and flowers\nand acanthus leaves gracefully carved. Old as these are, they look as\nfresh as if they were only just finished. Bronze workers, also, make\nmoulds for the casting of bronze out of stone from these quarries, and\nfind it very useful in bronze-founding. If the quarries were only near\nRome, all our buildings might well be constructed from the products of\nthese workshops.\n5. But since, on account of the proximity of the stone-quarries of\nGrotta Rossa, Palla, and the others that are nearest to the city,\nnecessity drives us to make use of their products, we must proceed as\nfollows, if we wish our work to be finished without flaws. Let the stone\nbe taken from the quarry two years before building is to begin, and not\nin winter but in summer. Then let it lie exposed in an open place. Such\nstone as has been damaged by the two years of exposure should be used in\nthe foundations. The rest, which remains unhurt, has passed the test of\nnature and will endure in those parts of the building which are above\nground. This precaution should be observed, not only with dimension\nstone, but also with the rubble which is to be used in walls.\n[Illustration: Photo. Moscioni\nEXAMPLE OF OPUS INCERTUM. THE CIRCULAR TEMPLE AT TIVOLI]\nCHAPTER VIII\nMETHODS OF BUILDING WALLS\n1. There are two styles of walls: \"opus reticulatum,\" now used by\neverybody, and the ancient style called \"opus incertum.\" Of these, the\nreticulatum looks better, but its construction makes it likely to crack,\nbecause its beds and builds spread out in every direction. On the other\nhand, in the opus incertum, the rubble, lying in courses and imbricated,\nmakes a wall which, though not beautiful, is stronger than the\nreticulatum.\n2. Both kinds should be constructed of the smallest stones, so that the\nwalls, being thoroughly puddled with the mortar, which is made of lime\nand sand, may hold together longer. Since the stones used are soft and\nporous, they are apt to suck the moisture out of the mortar and so to\ndry it up. But when there is abundance of lime and sand, the wall,\ncontaining more moisture, will not soon lose its strength, for they will\nhold it together. But as soon as the moisture is sucked out of the\nmortar by the porous rubble, and the lime and sand separate and\ndisunite, the rubble can no longer adhere to them and the wall will in\ntime become a ruin.\n3. This we may learn from several monuments in the environs of the city,\nwhich are built of marble or dimension stone, but on the inside packed\nwith masonry between the outer walls. In the course of time, the mortar\nhas lost its strength, which has been sucked out of it by the porousness\nof the rubble; and so the monuments are tumbling down and going to\npieces, with their joints loosened by the settling of the material that\nbound them together.\n4. He who wishes to avoid such a disaster should leave a cavity behind\nthe facings, and on the inside build walls two feet thick, made of red\ndimension stone or burnt brick or lava in courses, and then bind them to\nthe fronts by means of iron clamps and lead. For thus his work, being no\nmere heap of material but regularly laid in courses, will be strong\nenough to last forever without a flaw, because the beds and builds, all\nsettling equally and bonded at the joints, will not let the work bulge\nout, nor allow the fall of the face walls which have been tightly\nfastened together.\n5. Consequently, the method of construction employed by the Greeks is\nnot to be despised. They do not use a structure of soft rubble polished\non the outside, but whenever they forsake dimension stone, they lay\ncourses of lava or of some hard stone, and, as though building with\nbrick, they bind the upright joints by interchanging the direction of\nthe stones as they lie in the courses. Thus they attain to a perfection\nthat will endure to eternity. These structures are of two kinds. One of\nthem is called \"isodomum,\" the other \"pseudisodomum.\"\n6. A wall is called isodomum when all the courses are of equal height;\npseudisodomum, when the rows of courses do not match but run unequally.\nBoth kinds are strong: first, because the rubble itself is of close\ntexture and solid, unable to suck the moisture out of the mortar, but\nkeeping it in its moist condition for a very long period; secondly,\nbecause the beds of the stones, being laid smooth and level to begin\nwith, keep the mortar from falling, and, as they are bonded throughout\nthe entire thickness of the wall, they hold together for a very long\nperiod.\n7. Another method is that which they call [Greek: emplekton], used also\namong us in the country. In this the facings are finished, but the other\nstones left in their natural state and then laid with alternate bonding\nstones. But our workmen, in their hurry to finish, devote themselves\nonly to the facings of the walls, setting them upright but filling the\nspace between with a lot of broken stones and mortar thrown in anyhow.\nThis makes three different sections in the same structure; two\nconsisting of facing and one of filling between them. The Greeks,\nhowever, do not build so; but laying their stones level and building\nevery other stone length-wise into the thickness, they do not fill the\nspace between, but construct the thickness of their walls in one solid\nand unbroken mass from the facings to the interior. Further, at\nintervals they lay single stones which run through the entire\nthickness of the wall. These stones, which show at each end, are called\n[Greek: diatonoi], and by their bonding powers they add very greatly to\nthe solidity of the walls.\n[Illustration: Photo. Moscioni\nOPUS RETICULATUM FROM THE THERMAE OF HADRIAN'S VILLA AT TIVOLI]\n[Illustration: Photo. Moscioni\nEXAMPLE OF OPUS RETICULATUM FROM THE DOORWAY OF THE STOA POECILE. VILLA\nOF HADRIAN AT TIVOLI]\n8. One who in accordance with these notes will take pains in selecting\nhis method of construction, may count upon having something that will\nlast. No walls made of rubble and finished with delicate beauty--no such\nwalls can escape ruin as time goes on. Hence, when arbitrators are\nchosen to set a valuation on party walls, they do not value them at what\nthey cost to build, but look up the written contract in each case and\nthen, after deducting from the cost one eightieth for each year that the\nwall has been standing, decide that the remainder is the sum to be paid.\nThey thus in effect pronounce that such walls cannot last more than\neighty years.\n9. In the case of brick walls, however, no deduction is made provided\nthat they are still standing plumb, but they are always valued at what\nthey cost to build. Hence in some states we may see public buildings and\nprivate houses, as well as those of kings, built of brick: in Athens,\nfor example, the part of the wall which faces Mt. Hymettus and\nPentelicus; at Patras, the cellae of the temple of Jupiter and Hercules,\nwhich are brick, although on the outside the entablature and columns of\nthe temple are of stone; in Italy, at Arezzo, an ancient wall\nexcellently built; at Tralles, the house built for the kings of the\ndynasty of Attalus, which is now always granted to the man who holds the\nstate priesthood. In Sparta, paintings have been taken out of certain\nwalls by cutting through the bricks, then have been placed in wooden\nframes, and so brought to the Comitium to adorn the aedileship of Varro\nand Murena.\n10. Then there is the house of Croesus which the people of Sardis have\nset apart as a place of repose for their fellow-citizens in the\nretirement of age,--a \"Gerousia\" for the guild of the elder men. At\nHalicarnassus, the house of that most potent king Mausolus, though\ndecorated throughout with Proconnesian marble, has walls built of brick\nwhich are to this day of extraordinary strength, and are covered with\nstucco so highly polished that they seem to be as glistening as glass.\nThat king did not use brick from poverty; for he was choke-full of\nrevenues, being ruler of all Caria.\n11. As for his skill and ingenuity as a builder, they may be seen from\nwhat follows. He was born at Melassa, but recognizing the natural\nadvantages of Halicarnassus as a fortress, and seeing that it was\nsuitable as a trading centre and that it had a good harbour, he fixed\nhis residence there. The place had a curvature like that of the seats in\na theatre. On the lowest tier, along the harbour, was built the forum.\nAbout halfway up the curving slope, at the point where the curved\ncross-aisle is in a theatre, a broad wide street was laid out, in the\nmiddle of which was built the Mausoleum, a work so remarkable that it is\nclassed among the Seven Wonders of the World. At the top of the hill, in\nthe centre, is the fane of Mars, containing a colossal acrolithic statue\nby the famous hand of Leochares. That is, some think that this statue is\nby Leochares, others by Timotheus. At the extreme right of the summit is\nthe fane of Venus and Mercury, close to the spring of Salmacis.\n12. There is a mistaken idea that this spring infects those who drink of\nit with an unnatural lewdness. It will not be out of place to explain\nhow this idea came to spread throughout the world from a mistake in the\ntelling of the tale. It cannot be that the water makes men effeminate\nand unchaste, as it is said to do; for the spring is of remarkable\nclearness and excellent in flavour. The fact is that when Melas and\nArevanias came there from Argos and Troezen and founded a colony\ntogether, they drove out the Carians and Lelegans who were barbarians.\nThese took refuge in the mountains, and, uniting there, used to make\nraids, plundering the Greeks and laying their country waste in a cruel\nmanner. Later, one of the colonists, to make money, set up a\nwell-stocked shop, near the spring because the water was so good, and\nthe way in which he carried it on attracted the barbarians. So they\nbegan to come down, one at a time, and to meet with society, and thus\nthey were brought back of their own accord, giving up their rough and\nsavage ways for the delights of Greek customs. Hence this water acquired\nits peculiar reputation, not because it really induced unchastity, but\nbecause those barbarians were softened by the charm of civilization.\n[Illustration: THE MAUSOLEUM AT HALICARNASSUS AS RESTORED BY FRIEDRICH\nADLER]\n13. But since I have been tempted into giving a description of this\nfortified place, it remains to finish my account of it. Corresponding to\nthe fane of Venus and the spring described above, which are on the\nright, we have on the extreme left the royal palace which king Mausolus\nbuilt there in accordance with a plan all his own. To the right it\ncommands a view of the forum, the harbour, and the entire line of\nfortifications, while just below it, to the left, there is a concealed\nharbour, hidden under the walls in such a way that nobody could see or\nknow what was going on in it. Only the king himself could, in case of\nneed, give orders from his own palace to the oarsmen and soldiers,\nwithout the knowledge of anybody else.\n14. After the death of Mausolus, his wife Artemisia became queen, and\nthe Rhodians, regarding it as an outrage that a woman should be ruler of\nthe states of all Caria, fitted out a fleet and sallied forth to seize\nupon the kingdom. When news of this reached Artemisia, she gave orders\nthat her fleet should be hidden away in that harbour with oarsmen and\nmarines mustered and concealed, but that the rest of the citizens should\ntake their places on the city wall. After the Rhodians had landed at the\nlarger harbour with their well-equipped fleet, she ordered the people on\nthe wall to cheer them and to promise that they would deliver up the\ntown. Then, when they had passed inside the wall, leaving their fleet\nempty, Artemisia suddenly made a canal which led to the sea, brought her\nfleet thus out of the smaller harbour, and so sailed into the larger.\nDisembarking her soldiers, she towed the empty fleet of the Rhodians out\nto sea. So the Rhodians were surrounded without means of retreat, and\nwere slain in the very forum.\n15. So Artemisia embarked her own soldiers and oarsmen in the ships of\nthe Rhodians and set forth for Rhodes. The Rhodians, beholding their own\nships approaching wreathed with laurel, supposed that their\nfellow-citizens were returning victorious, and admitted the enemy. Then\nArtemisia, after taking Rhodes and killing its leading men, put up in\nthe city of Rhodes a trophy of her victory, including two bronze\nstatues, one representing the state of the Rhodians, the other herself.\nHerself she fashioned in the act of branding the state of the Rhodians.\nIn later times the Rhodians, labouring under the religious scruple which\nmakes it a sin to remove trophies once they are dedicated, constructed a\nbuilding to surround the place, and thus by the erection of the \"Grecian\nStation\" covered it so that nobody could see it, and ordered that the\nbuilding be called \"[Greek: abaton].\"\n16. Since such very powerful kings have not disdained walls built of\nbrick, although with their revenues and from booty they might often have\nhad them not only of masonry or dimension stone but even of marble, I\nthink that one ought not to reject buildings made of brick-work,\nprovided that they are properly \"topped.\" But I shall explain why this\nkind of structure should not be used by the Roman people within the\ncity, not omitting the reasons and the grounds for them.\n17. The laws of the state forbid that walls abutting on public property\nshould be more than a foot and a half thick. The other walls are built\nof the same thickness in order to save space. Now brick walls, unless\ntwo or three bricks thick, cannot support more than one story; certainly\nnot if they are only a foot and a half in thickness. But with the\npresent importance of the city and the unlimited numbers of its\npopulation, it is necessary to increase the number of dwelling-places\nindefinitely. Consequently, as the ground floors could not admit of so\ngreat a number living in the city, the nature of the case has made it\nnecessary to find relief by making the buildings high. In these tall\npiles reared with piers of stone, walls of burnt brick, and partitions\nof rubble work, and provided with floor after floor, the upper stories\ncan be partitioned off into rooms to very great advantage. The\naccommodations within the city walls being thus multiplied as a result\nof the many floors high in the air, the Roman people easily find\nexcellent places in which to live.\n18. It has now been explained how limitations of building space\nnecessarily forbid the employment of brick walls within the city. When\nit becomes necessary to use them outside the city, they should be\nconstructed as follows in order to be perfect and durable. On the top of\nthe wall lay a structure of burnt brick, about a foot and a half in\nheight, under the tiles and projecting like a coping. Thus the defects\nusual in these walls can be avoided. For when the tiles on the roof are\nbroken or thrown down by the wind so that rainwater can leak through,\nthis burnt brick coating will prevent the crude brick from being\ndamaged, and the cornice-like projection will throw off the drops beyond\nthe vertical face, and thus the walls, though of crude brick structure,\nwill be preserved intact.\n19. With regard to burnt brick, nobody can tell offhand whether it is of\nthe best or unfit to use in a wall, because its strength can be tested\nonly after it has been used on a roof and exposed to bad weather and\ntime--then, if it is good it is accepted. If not made of good clay or if\nnot baked sufficiently, it shows itself defective there when exposed to\nfrosts and rime. Brick that will not stand exposure on roofs can never\nbe strong enough to carry its load in a wall. Hence the strongest burnt\nbrick walls are those which are constructed out of old roofing tiles.\n20. As for \"wattle and daub\" I could wish that it had never been\ninvented. The more it saves in time and gains in space, the greater and\nthe more general is the disaster that it may cause; for it is made to\ncatch fire, like torches. It seems better, therefore, to spend on walls\nof burnt brick, and be at expense, than to save with \"wattle and daub,\"\nand be in danger. And, in the stucco covering, too, it makes cracks from\nthe inside by the arrangement of its studs and girts. For these swell\nwith moisture as they are daubed, and then contract as they dry, and, by\ntheir shrinking, cause the solid stucco to split. But since some are\nobliged to use it either to save time or money, or for partitions on an\nunsupported span, the proper method of construction is as follows. Give\nit a high foundation so that it may nowhere come in contact with the\nbroken stone-work composing the floor; for if it is sunk in this, it\nrots in course of time, then settles and sags forward, and so breaks\nthrough the surface of the stucco covering.\nI have now explained to the best of my ability the subject of walls, and\nthe preparation of the different kinds of material employed, with their\nadvantages and disadvantages. Next, following the guidance of Nature, I\nshall treat of the framework and the kinds of wood used in it, showing\nhow they may be procured of a sort that will not give way as time goes\non.\nCHAPTER IX\nTIMBER\n1. Timber should be felled between early Autumn and the time when\nFavonius begins to blow. For in Spring all trees become pregnant, and\nthey are all employing their natural vigour in the production of leaves\nand of the fruits that return every year. The requirements of that\nseason render them empty and swollen, and so they are weak and feeble\nbecause of their looseness of texture. This is also the case with women\nwho have conceived. Their bodies are not considered perfectly healthy\nuntil the child is born; hence, pregnant slaves, when offered for sale,\nare not warranted sound, because the fetus as it grows within the body\ntakes to itself as nourishment all the best qualities of the mother's\nfood, and so the stronger it becomes as the full time for birth\napproaches, the less compact it allows that body to be from which it is\nproduced. After the birth of the child, what was heretofore taken to\npromote the growth of another creature is now set free by the delivery\nof the newborn, and the channels being now empty and open, the body will\ntake it in by lapping up its juices, and thus becomes compact and\nreturns to the natural strength which it had before.\n2. On the same principle, with the ripening of the fruits in Autumn the\nleaves begin to wither and the trees, taking up their sap from the earth\nthrough the roots, recover themselves and are restored to their former\nsolid texture. But the strong air of winter compresses and solidifies\nthem during the time above mentioned. Consequently, if the timber is\nfelled on the principle and at the time above mentioned, it will be\nfelled at the proper season.\n3. In felling a tree we should cut into the trunk of it to the very\nheart, and then leave it standing so that the sap may drain out drop by\ndrop throughout the whole of it. In this way the useless liquid which is\nwithin will run out through the sapwood instead of having to die in a\nmass of decay, thus spoiling the quality of the timber. Then and not\ntill then, the tree being drained dry and the sap no longer dripping,\nlet it be felled and it will be in the highest state of usefulness.\n4. That this is so may be seen in the case of fruit trees. When these\nare tapped at the base and pruned, each at the proper time, they pour\nout from the heart through the tapholes all the superfluous and\ncorrupting fluid which they contain, and thus the draining process makes\nthem durable. But when the juices of trees have no means of escape, they\nclot and rot in them, making the trees hollow and good for nothing.\nTherefore, if the draining process does not exhaust them while they are\nstill alive, there is no doubt that, if the same principle is followed\nin felling them for timber, they will last a long time and be very\nuseful in buildings.\n5. Trees vary and are unlike one another in their qualities. Thus it is\nwith the oak, elm, poplar, cypress, fir, and the others which are most\nsuitable to use in buildings. The oak, for instance, has not the\nefficacy of the fir, nor the cypress that of the elm. Nor in the case of\nother trees, is it natural that they should be alike; but the individual\nkinds are effective in building, some in one way, some in another, owing\nto the different properties of their elements.\n6. To begin with fir: it contains a great deal of air and fire with very\nlittle moisture and the earthy, so that, as its natural properties are\nof the lighter class, it is not heavy. Hence, its consistence being\nnaturally stiff, it does not easily bend under the load, and keeps its\nstraightness when used in the framework. But it contains so much heat\nthat it generates and encourages decay, which spoils it; and it also\nkindles fire quickly because of the air in its body, which is so open\nthat it takes in fire and so gives out a great flame.\n7. The part which is nearest to the earth before the tree is cut down\ntakes up moisture through the roots from the immediate neighbourhood and\nhence is without knots and is \"clear.\" But the upper part, on account of\nthe great heat in it, throws up branches into the air through the knots;\nand this, when it is cut off about twenty feet from the ground and then\nhewn, is called \"knotwood\" because of its hardness and knottiness. The\nlowest part, after the tree is cut down and the sapwood of the same\nthrown away, is split up into four pieces and prepared for joiner's\nwork, and so is called \"clearstock.\"\n8. Oak, on the other hand, having enough and to spare of the earthy\namong its elements, and containing but little moisture, air, and fire,\nlasts for an unlimited period when buried in underground structures. It\nfollows that when exposed to moisture, as its texture is not loose and\nporous, it cannot take in liquid on account of its compactness, but,\nwithdrawing from the moisture, it resists it and warps, thus making\ncracks in the structures in which it is used.\n9. The winter oak, being composed of a moderate amount of all the\nelements, is very useful in buildings, but when in a moist place, it\ntakes in water to its centre through its pores, its air and fire being\nexpelled by the influence of the moisture, and so it rots. The Turkey\noak and the beech, both containing a mixture of moisture, fire, and the\nearthy, with a great deal of air, through this loose texture take in\nmoisture to their centre and soon decay. White and black poplar, as well\nas willow, linden, and the agnus castus, containing an abundance of\nfire and air, a moderate amount of moisture, and only a small amount of\nthe earthy, are composed of a mixture which is proportionately rather\nlight, and so they are of great service from their stiffness. Although\non account of the mixture of the earthy in them they are not hard, yet\ntheir loose texture makes them gleaming white, and they are a convenient\nmaterial to use in carving.\n10. The alder, which is produced close by river banks, and which seems\nto be altogether useless as building material, has really excellent\nqualities. It is composed of a very large proportion of air and fire,\nnot much of the earthy, and only a little moisture. Hence, in swampy\nplaces, alder piles driven close together beneath the foundations of\nbuildings take in the water which their own consistence lacks and remain\nimperishable forever, supporting structures of enormous weight and\nkeeping them from decay. Thus a material which cannot last even a little\nwhile above ground, endures for a long time when covered with moisture.\n11. One can see this at its best in Ravenna; for there all the\nbuildings, both public and private, have piles of this sort beneath\ntheir foundations. The elm and the ash contain a very great amount of\nmoisture, a minimum of air and fire, and a moderate mixture of the\nearthy in their composition. When put in shape for use in buildings they\nare tough and, having no stiffness on account of the weight of moisture\nin them, soon bend. But when they become dry with age, or are allowed to\nlose their sap and die standing in the open, they get harder, and from\ntheir toughness supply a strong material for dowels to be used in joints\nand other articulations.\n12. The hornbeam, which has a very small amount of fire and of the\nearthy in its composition, but a very great proportion of air and\nmoisture, is not a wood that breaks easily, and is very convenient to\nhandle. Hence, the Greeks call it \"zygia,\" because they make of it yokes\nfor their draught-animals, and their word for yoke is [Greek: zyga].\nCypress and pine are also just as admirable; for although they contain\nan abundance of moisture mixed with an equivalent composed of all the\nother elements, and so are apt to warp when used in buildings on account\nof this superfluity of moisture, yet they can be kept to a great age\nwithout rotting, because the liquid contained within their substances\nhas a bitter taste which by its pungency prevents the entrance of decay\nor of those little creatures which are destructive. Hence, buildings\nmade of these kinds of wood last for an unending period of time.\n13. The cedar and the juniper tree have the same uses and good\nqualities, but, while the cypress and pine yield resin, from the cedar\nis produced an oil called cedar-oil. Books as well as other things\nsmeared with this are not hurt by worms or decay. The foliage of this\ntree is like that of the cypress but the grain of the wood is straight.\nThe statue of Diana in the temple at Ephesus is made of it, and so are\nthe coffered ceilings both there and in all other famous fanes, because\nthat wood is everlasting. The tree grows chiefly in Crete, Africa, and\nin some districts of Syria.\n14. The larch, known only to the people of the towns on the banks of the\nriver Po and the shores of the Adriatic, is not only preserved from\ndecay and the worm by the great bitterness of its sap, but also it\ncannot be kindled with fire nor ignite of itself, unless like stone in a\nlimekiln it is burned with other wood. And even then it does not take\nfire nor produce burning coals, but after a long time it slowly consumes\naway. This is because there is a very small proportion of the elements\nof fire and air in its composition, which is a dense and solid mass of\nmoisture and the earthy, so that it has no open pores through which fire\ncan find its way; but it repels the force of fire and does not let\nitself be harmed by it quickly. Further, its weight will not let it\nfloat in water, so that when transported it is loaded on shipboard or on\nrafts made of fir.\n15. It is worth while to know how this wood was discovered. The divine\nCaesar, being with his army in the neighbourhood of the Alps, and having\nordered the towns to furnish supplies, the inhabitants of a fortified\nstronghold there, called Larignum, trusting in the natural strength of\ntheir defences, refused to obey his command. So the general ordered his\nforces to the assault. In front of the gate of this stronghold there\nwas a tower, made of beams of this wood laid in alternating directions\nat right angles to each other, like a funeral pyre, and built high, so\nthat they could drive off an attacking party by throwing stakes and\nstones from the top. When it was observed that they had no other\nmissiles than stakes, and that these could not be hurled very far from\nthe wall on account of the weight, orders were given to approach and to\nthrow bundles of brushwood and lighted torches at this outwork. These\nthe soldiers soon got together.\n16. The flames soon kindled the brushwood which lay about that wooden\nstructure and, rising towards heaven, made everybody think that the\nwhole pile had fallen. But when the fire had burned itself out and\nsubsided, and the tower appeared to view entirely uninjured, Caesar in\namazement gave orders that they should be surrounded with a palisade,\nbuilt beyond the range of missiles. So the townspeople were frightened\ninto surrendering, and were then asked where that wood came from which\nwas not harmed by fire. They pointed to trees of the kind under\ndiscussion, of which there are very great numbers in that vicinity. And\nso, as that stronghold was called Larignum, the wood was called larch.\nIt is transported by way of the Po to Ravenna, and is to be had in Fano,\nPesaro, Ancona, and the other towns in that neighbourhood. If there were\nonly a ready method of carrying this material to Rome, it would be of\nthe greatest use in buildings; if not for general purposes, yet at least\nif the boards used in the eaves running round blocks of houses were made\nof it, the buildings would be free from the danger of fire spreading\nacross to them, because such boards can neither take fire from flames or\nfrom burning coals, nor ignite spontaneously.\n17. The leaves of these trees are like those of the pine; timber from\nthem comes in long lengths, is as easily wrought in joiner's work as is\nthe clearwood of fir, and contains a liquid resin, of the colour of\nAttic honey, which is good for consumptives.\nWith regard to the different kinds of timber, I have now explained of\nwhat natural properties they appear to be composed, and how they were\nproduced. It remains to consider the question why the highland fir, as\nit is called in Rome, is inferior, while the lowland fir is extremely\nuseful in buildings so far as durability is concerned; and further to\nexplain how it is that their bad or good qualities seem to be due to the\npeculiarities of their neighbourhood, so that this subject may be\nclearer to those who examine it.\nCHAPTER X\nHIGHLAND AND LOWLAND FIR\n1. The first spurs of the Apennines arise from the Tuscan sea between\nthe Alps and the most distant borders of Tuscany. The mountain range\nitself bends round and, almost touching the shores of the Adriatic in\nthe middle of the curve, completes its circuit by extending to the\nstrait on the other shore. Hence, this side of the curve, sloping\ntowards the districts of Tuscany and Campania, lies basking in the sun,\nbeing constantly exposed to the full force of its rays all day. But the\nfurther side, sloping towards the Upper Sea and having a northern\nexposure, is constantly shrouded in shadowy darkness. Hence the trees\nwhich grow on that side, being nourished by the moisture, not only\nthemselves attain to a very large size, but their fibre too, filled full\nof moisture, is swollen and distended with abundance of liquid. When\nthey lose their vitality after being felled and hewn, the fibre retains\nits stiffness, and the trees as they dry become hollow and frail on\naccount of their porosity, and hence cannot last when used in buildings.\n2. But trees which grow in places facing the course of the sun are not\nof porous fibre but are solid, being drained by the dryness; for the sun\nabsorbs moisture and draws it out of trees as well as out of the earth.\nThe trees in sunny neighbourhoods, therefore, being solidified by the\ncompact texture of their fibre, and not being porous from moisture, are\nvery useful, so far as durability goes, when they are hewn into timber.\nHence the lowland firs, being conveyed from sunny places, are better\nthan those highland firs, which are brought here from shady places.\n3. To the best of my mature consideration, I have now treated the\nmaterials which are necessary in the construction of buildings, the\nproportionate amount of the elements which are seen to be contained in\ntheir natural composition, and the points of excellence and defects of\neach kind, so that they may be not unknown to those who are engaged in\nbuilding. Thus those who can follow the directions contained in this\ntreatise will be better informed in advance, and able to select, among\nthe different kinds, those which will be of use in their works.\nTherefore, since the preliminaries have been explained, the buildings\nthemselves will be treated in the remaining books; and first, as due\norder requires, I shall in the next book write of the temples of the\nimmortal gods and their symmetrical proportions.\nBOOK III\nINTRODUCTION\n1. Apollo at Delphi, through the oracular utterance of his priestess,\npronounced Socrates the wisest of men. Of him it is related that he said\nwith sagacity and great learning that the human breast should have been\nfurnished with open windows, so that men might not keep their feelings\nconcealed, but have them open to the view. Oh that nature, following his\nidea, had constructed them thus unfolded and obvious to the view! For if\nit had been so, not merely the virtues and vices of the mind would be\neasily visible, but also its knowledge of branches of study, displayed\nto the contemplation of the eyes, would not need testing by\nuntrustworthy powers of judgement, but a singular and lasting influence\nwould thus be lent to the learned and wise. However, since they are not\nso constructed, but are as nature willed them to be, it is impossible\nfor men, while natural abilities are concealed in the breast, to form a\njudgement on the quality of the knowledge of the arts which is thus\ndeeply hidden. And if artists themselves testify to their own skill,\nthey can never, unless they are wealthy or famous from the age of their\nstudios, or unless they are also possessed of the public favour and of\neloquence, have an influence commensurate with their devotion to their\npursuits, so that people may believe them to have the knowledge which\nthey profess to have.\n2. In particular we can learn this from the case of the sculptors and\npainters of antiquity. Those among them who were marked by high station\nor favourably recommended have come down to posterity with a name that\nwill last forever; for instance, Myron, Polycletus, Phidias, Lysippus,\nand the others who have attained to fame by their art. For they acquired\nit by the execution of works for great states or for kings or for\ncitizens of rank. But those who, being men of no less enthusiasm,\nnatural ability, and dexterity than those famous artists, and who\nexecuted no less perfectly finished works for citizens of low station,\nare unremembered, not because they lacked diligence or dexterity in\ntheir art, but because fortune failed them; for instance, Teleas of\nAthens, Chion of Corinth, Myager the Phocaean, Pharax of Ephesus, Boedas\nof Byzantium, and many others. Then there were painters like Aristomenes\nof Thasos, Polycles and Andron of Ephesus, Theo of Magnesia, and others\nwho were not deficient in diligence or enthusiasm for their art or in\ndexterity, but whose narrow means or ill-luck, or the higher position of\ntheir rivals in the struggle for honour, stood in the way of their\nattaining distinction.\n3. Of course, we need not be surprised if artistic excellence goes\nunrecognized on account of being unknown; but there should be the\ngreatest indignation when, as often, good judges are flattered by the\ncharm of social entertainments into an approbation which is a mere\npretence. Now if, as Socrates wished, our feelings, opinions, and\nknowledge gained by study had been manifest and clear to see, popularity\nand adulation would have no influence, but men who had reached the\nheight of knowledge by means of correct and definite courses of study,\nwould be given commissions without any effort on their part. However,\nsince such things are not plain and apparent to the view, as we think\nthey should have been, and since I observe that the uneducated rather\nthan the educated are in higher favour, thinking it beneath me to engage\nwith the uneducated in the struggle for honour, I prefer to show the\nexcellence of our department of knowledge by the publication of this\ntreatise.\n4. In my first book, Emperor, I described to you the art, with its\npoints of excellence, the different kinds of training with which the\narchitect ought to be equipped, adding the reasons why he ought to be\nskilful in them, and I divided up the subject of architecture as a whole\namong its departments, duly defining the limits of each. Next, as was\npre\u00ebminent and necessary, I explained on scientific principles the\nmethod of selecting healthy sites for fortified towns, pointed out by\ngeometrical figures the different winds and the quarters from which they\nblow, and showed the proper way to lay out the lines of streets and rows\nof houses within the walls. Here I fixed the end of my first book. In\nthe second, on building materials, I treated their various advantages in\nstructures, and the natural properties of which they are composed. In\nthis third book I shall speak of the temples of the immortal gods,\ndescribing and explaining them in the proper manner.\nCHAPTER I\nON SYMMETRY: IN TEMPLES AND IN THE HUMAN BODY\n1. The design of a temple depends on symmetry, the principles of which\nmust be most carefully observed by the architect. They are due to\nproportion, in Greek [Greek: analogia]. Proportion is a correspondence\namong the measures of the members of an entire work, and of the whole to\na certain part selected as standard. From this result the principles of\nsymmetry. Without symmetry and proportion there can be no principles in\nthe design of any temple; that is, if there is no precise relation\nbetween its members, as in the case of those of a well shaped man.\n2. For the human body is so designed by nature that the face, from the\nchin to the top of the forehead and the lowest roots of the hair, is a\ntenth part of the whole height; the open hand from the wrist to the tip\nof the middle finger is just the same; the head from the chin to the\ncrown is an eighth, and with the neck and shoulder from the top of the\nbreast to the lowest roots of the hair is a sixth; from the middle of\nthe breast to the summit of the crown is a fourth. If we take the height\nof the face itself, the distance from the bottom of the chin to the\nunder side of the nostrils is one third of it; the nose from the under\nside of the nostrils to a line between the eyebrows is the same; from\nthere to the lowest roots of the hair is also a third, comprising the\nforehead. The length of the foot is one sixth of the height of the body;\nof the forearm, one fourth; and the breadth of the breast is also one\nfourth. The other members, too, have their own symmetrical proportions,\nand it was by employing them that the famous painters and sculptors of\nantiquity attained to great and endless renown.\n3. Similarly, in the members of a temple there ought to be the greatest\nharmony in the symmetrical relations of the different parts to the\ngeneral magnitude of the whole. Then again, in the human body the\ncentral point is naturally the navel. For if a man be placed flat on his\nback, with his hands and feet extended, and a pair of compasses centred\nat his navel, the fingers and toes of his two hands and feet will touch\nthe circumference of a circle described therefrom. And just as the human\nbody yields a circular outline, so too a square figure may be found from\nit. For if we measure the distance from the soles of the feet to the top\nof the head, and then apply that measure to the outstretched arms, the\nbreadth will be found to be the same as the height, as in the case of\nplane surfaces which are perfectly square.\n4. Therefore, since nature has designed the human body so that its\nmembers are duly proportioned to the frame as a whole, it appears that\nthe ancients had good reason for their rule, that in perfect buildings\nthe different members must be in exact symmetrical relations to the\nwhole general scheme. Hence, while transmitting to us the proper\narrangements for buildings of all kinds, they were particularly careful\nto do so in the case of temples of the gods, buildings in which merits\nand faults usually last forever.\n5. Further, it was from the members of the body that they derived the\nfundamental ideas of the measures which are obviously necessary in all\nworks, as the finger, palm, foot, and cubit. These they apportioned so\nas to form the \"perfect number,\" called in Greek [Greek: teleion], and\nas the perfect number the ancients fixed upon ten. For it is from the\nnumber of the fingers of the hand that the palm is found, and the foot\nfrom the palm. Again, while ten is naturally perfect, as being made up\nby the fingers of the two palms, Plato also held that this number was\nperfect because ten is composed of the individual units, called by the\nGreeks [Greek: monades]. But as soon as eleven or twelve is reached, the\nnumbers, being excessive, cannot be perfect until they come to ten for\nthe second time; for the component parts of that number are the\nindividual units.\n6. The mathematicians, however, maintaining a different view, have said\nthat the perfect number is six, because this number is composed of\nintegral parts which are suited numerically to their method of\nreckoning: thus, one is one sixth; two is one third; three is one half;\nfour is two thirds, or [Greek: dimoiros] as they call it; five is five\nsixths, called [Greek: pentamoiros]; and six is the perfect number. As\nthe number goes on growing larger, the addition of a unit above six is\nthe [Greek: ephektos]; eight, formed by the addition of a third part of\nsix, is the integer and a third, called [Greek: epitritos]; the addition\nof one half makes nine, the integer and a half, termed [Greek:\nh\u00eamiolios]; the addition of two thirds, making the number ten, is the\ninteger and two thirds, which they call [Greek: epidimoiros]; in the\nnumber eleven, where five are added, we have the five sixths, called\n[Greek: epipemptos]; finally, twelve, being composed of the two simple\nintegers, is called [Greek: diplasios].\n7. And further, as the foot is one sixth of a man's height, the height\nof the body as expressed in number of feet being limited to six, they\nheld that this was the perfect number, and observed that the cubit\nconsisted of six palms or of twenty-four fingers. This principle seems\nto have been followed by the states of Greece. As the cubit consisted of\nsix palms, they made the drachma, which they used as their unit, consist\nin the same way of six bronze coins, like our _asses_, which they call\nobols; and, to correspond to the fingers, divided the drachma into\ntwenty-four quarter-obols, which some call dichalca others trichalca.\n8. But our countrymen at first fixed upon the ancient number and made\nten bronze pieces go to the denarius, and this is the origin of the name\nwhich is applied to the denarius to this day. And the fourth part of it,\nconsisting of two asses and half of a third, they called \"sesterce.\" But\nlater, observing that six and ten were both of them perfect numbers,\nthey combined the two, and thus made the most perfect number, sixteen.\nThey found their authority for this in the foot. For if we take two\npalms from the cubit, there remains the foot of four palms; but the palm\ncontains four fingers. Hence the foot contains sixteen fingers, and the\ndenarius the same number of bronze _asses_.\n9. Therefore, if it is agreed that number was found out from the human\nfingers, and that there is a symmetrical correspondence between the\nmembers separately and the entire form of the body, in accordance with a\ncertain part selected as standard, we can have nothing but respect for\nthose who, in constructing temples of the immortal gods, have so\narranged the members of the works that both the separate parts and the\nwhole design may harmonize in their proportions and symmetry.\nCHAPTER II\nCLASSIFICATION OF TEMPLES\n1. There are certain elementary forms on which the general aspect of a\ntemple depends. First there is the temple in antis, or [Greek: naos en\nparastasin] as it is called in Greek; then the prostyle, amphiprostyle,\nperipteral, pseudodipteral, dipteral, and hypaethral. These different\nforms may be described as follows.\n2. It will be a temple in antis when it has antae carried out in front\nof the walls which enclose the cella, and in the middle, between the\nantae, two columns, and over them the pediment constructed in the\nsymmetrical proportions to be described later in this work. An example\nwill be found at the Three Fortunes, in that one of the three which is\nnearest the Colline gate.\n3. The prostyle is in all respects like the temple in antis, except that\nat the corners, opposite the antae, it has two columns, and that it has\narchitraves not only in front, as in the case of the temple in antis,\nbut also one to the right and one to the left in the wings. An example\nof this is the temple of Jove and Faunus in the Island of the Tiber.\n4. The amphiprostyle is in all other respects like the prostyle, but has\nbesides, in the rear, the same arrangement of columns and pediment.\n5. A temple will be peripteral that has six columns in front and six in\nthe rear, with eleven on each side including the corner columns. Let\nthe columns be so placed as to leave a space, the width of an\nintercolumniation, all round between the walls and the rows of columns\non the outside, thus forming a walk round the cella of the temple, as\nin the cases of the temple of Jupiter Stator by Hermodorus in the\nPortico of Metellus, and the Marian temple of Honour and Valour\nconstructed by Mucius, which has no portico in the rear.\n[Illustration: THE CLASSIFICATION OF TEMPLES ACCORDING TO THE\nARRANGEMENTS OF THE COLONNADES]\n[Illustration: THE HYPAETHRAL TEMPLE OF VITRUVIUS COMPARED WITH THE\nPARTHENON AND THE TEMPLE OF APOLLO NEAR MILETUS]\n6. The pseudodipteral is so constructed that in front and in the rear\nthere are in each case eight columns, with fifteen on each side,\nincluding the corner columns. The walls of the cella in front and in the\nrear should be directly over against the four middle columns. Thus there\nwill be a space, the width of two intercolumniations plus the thickness\nof the lower diameter of a column, all round between the walls and the\nrows of columns on the outside. There is no example of this in Rome, but\nat Magnesia there is the temple of Diana by Hermogenes, and that of\nApollo at Alabanda by Mnesthes.\n7. The dipteral also is octastyle in both front and rear porticoes, but\nit has two rows of columns all round the temple, like the temple of\nQuirinus, which is Doric, and the temple of Diana at Ephesus, planned by\nChersiphron, which is Ionic.\n8. The hypaethral is decastyle in both front and rear porticoes. In\neverything else it is the same as the dipteral, but inside it has two\ntiers of columns set out from the wall all round, like the colonnade of\na peristyle. The central part is open to the sky, without a roof.\nFolding doors lead to it at each end, in the porticoes in front and in\nthe rear. There is no example of this sort in Rome, but in Athens there\nis the octastyle in the precinct of the Olympian.\nCHAPTER III\nTHE PROPORTIONS OF INTERCOLUMNIATIONS AND OF COLUMNS\n1. There are five classes of temples, designated as follows: pycnostyle,\nwith the columns close together; systyle, with the intercolumniations a\nlittle wider; diastyle, more open still; araeostyle, farther apart than\nthey ought to be; eustyle, with the intervals apportioned just right.\n[Illustration: THE CLASSIFICATION OF TEMPLES ACCORDING TO\nINTERCOLUMNIATION]\n2. The pycnostyle is a temple in an intercolumniation of which the\nthickness of a column and a half can be inserted: for example, the\ntemple of the Divine Caesar, that of Venus in Caesar's forum, and others\nconstructed like them. The systyle is a temple in which the thickness\nof two columns can be placed in an intercolumniation, and in which the\nplinths of the bases are equivalent to the distance between two plinths:\nfor example, the temple of Equestrian Fortune near the stone theatre,\nand the others which are constructed on the same principles.\n3. These two kinds have practical disadvantages. When the matrons mount\nthe steps for public prayer or thanksgiving, they cannot pass through\nthe intercolumniations with their arms about one another, but must form\nsingle file; then again, the effect of the folding doors is thrust out\nof sight by the crowding of the columns, and likewise the statues are\nthrown into shadow; the narrow space interferes also with walks round\nthe temple.\n4. The construction will be diastyle when we can insert the thickness of\nthree columns in an intercolumniation, as in the case of the temple of\nApollo and Diana. This arrangement involves the danger that the\narchitraves may break on account of the great width of the intervals.\n5. In araeostyles we cannot employ stone or marble for the architraves,\nbut must have a series of wooden beams laid upon the columns. And\nmoreover, in appearance these temples are clumsy-roofed, low, broad, and\ntheir pediments are adorned in the Tuscan fashion with statues of\nterra-cotta or gilt bronze: for example, near the Circus Maximus, the\ntemple of Ceres and Pompey's temple of Hercules; also the temple on the\nCapitol.\n6. An account must now be given of the eustyle, which is the most\napproved class, and is arranged on principles developed with a view to\nconvenience, beauty, and strength. The intervals should be made as wide\nas the thickness of two columns and a quarter, but the middle\nintercolumniations, one in front and the other in the rear, should be of\nthe thickness of three columns. Thus built, the effect of the design\nwill be beautiful, there will be no obstruction at the entrance, and the\nwalk round the cella will be dignified.\n[Illustration: THE EUSTYLE TEMPLE OF VITRUVIUS COMPARED WITH THE TEMPLE\nOF TEOS]\n7. The rule of this arrangement may be set forth as follows. If a\ntetrastyle is to be built, let the width of the front which shall have\nalready been determined for the temple, be divided into eleven parts and\na half, not including the substructures and the projections of the\nbases; if it is to be of six columns, into eighteen parts. If an\noctastyle is to be constructed, let the front be divided into\ntwenty-four parts and a half. Then, whether the temple is to be\ntetrastyle, hexastyle, or octastyle, let one of these parts be taken,\nand it will be the module. The thickness of the columns will be equal to\none module. Each of the intercolumniations, except those in the middle,\nwill measure two modules and a quarter. The middle intercolumniations in\nfront and in the rear will each measure three modules. The columns\nthemselves will be nine modules and a half in height. As a result of\nthis division, the intercolumniations and the heights of the columns\nwill be in due proportion.\n8. We have no example of this in Rome, but at Teos in Asia Minor there\nis one which is hexastyle, dedicated to Father Bacchus.\nThese rules for symmetry were established by Hermogenes, who was also\nthe first to devise the principle of the pseudodipteral octastyle. He\ndid so by dispensing with the inner rows of thirty-eight columns which\nbelonged to the symmetry of the dipteral temple, and in this way he made\na saving in expense and labour. He thus provided a much wider space for\nthe walk round the cella between it and the columns, and without\ndetracting at all from the general effect, or making one feel the loss\nof what had been really superfluous, he preserved the dignity of the\nwhole work by his new treatment of it.\n9. For the idea of the pteroma and the arrangement of the columns round\na temple were devised in order that the intercolumniations might give\nthe imposing effect of high relief; and also, in case a multitude of\npeople should be caught in a heavy shower and detained, that they might\nhave in the temple and round the cella a wide free space in which to\nwait. These ideas are developed, as I have described, in the\npseudodipteral arrangement of a temple. It appears, therefore, that\nHermogenes produced results which exhibit much acute ingenuity, and\nthat he left sources from which those who came after him could derive\ninstructive principles.\n[Illustration: VITRUVIUS' RULES FOR THE DIAMETER AND HEIGHT OF COLUMNS\nIN THE DIFFERENT CLASSES OF TEMPLE COMPARED WITH ACTUAL EXAMPLES]\n10. In araeostyle temples, the columns should be constructed so that\ntheir thickness is one eighth part of their height. In the diastyle, the\nheight of a column should be measured off into eight and a half parts,\nand the thickness of the column fixed at one of these parts. In the\nsystyle, let the height be divided into nine and a half parts, and one\nof these given to the thickness of the column. In the pycnostyle, the\nheight should be divided into ten parts, and one of these used for the\nthickness of the column. In the eustyle temple, let the height of a\ncolumn be divided, as in the systyle, into nine and a half parts, and\nlet one part be taken for the thickness at the bottom of the shaft. With\nthese dimensions we shall be taking into account the proportions of the\nintercolumniations.\n11. For the thickness of the shafts must be enlarged in proportion to\nthe increase of the distance between the columns. In the araeostyle, for\ninstance, if only a ninth or tenth part is given to the thickness, the\ncolumn will look thin and mean, because the width of the\nintercolumniations is such that the air seems to eat away and diminish\nthe thickness of such shafts. On the other hand, in pycnostyles, if an\neighth part is given to the thickness, it will make the shaft look\nswollen and ungraceful, because the intercolumniations are so close to\neach other and so narrow. We must therefore follow the rules of symmetry\nrequired by each kind of building. Then, too, the columns at the corners\nshould be made thicker than the others by a fiftieth of their own\ndiameter, because they are sharply outlined by the unobstructed air\nround them, and seem to the beholder more slender than they are. Hence,\nwe must counteract the ocular deception by an adjustment of proportions.\n[Illustration: THE DIMINUTION OF COLUMNS IN RELATION TO THEIR DIMENSIONS\nOF HEIGHT]\n12. Moreover, the diminution in the top of a column at the necking seems\nto be regulated on the following principles: if a column is fifteen feet\nor under, let the thickness at the bottom be divided into six parts,\nand let five of those parts form the thickness at the top. If it is from\nfifteen feet to twenty feet, let the bottom of the shaft be divided into\nsix and a half parts, and let five and a half of those parts be the\nupper thickness of the column. In a column of from twenty feet to thirty\nfeet, let the bottom of the shaft be divided into seven parts, and let\nthe diminished top measure six of these. A column of from thirty to\nforty feet should be divided at the bottom into seven and a half parts,\nand, on the principle of diminution, have six and a half of these at the\ntop. Columns of from forty feet to fifty should be divided into eight\nparts, and diminish to seven of these at the top of the shaft under the\ncapital. In the case of higher columns, let the diminution be determined\nproportionally, on the same principles.\n13. These proportionate enlargements are made in the thickness of\ncolumns on account of the different heights to which the eye has to\nclimb. For the eye is always in search of beauty, and if we do not\ngratify its desire for pleasure by a proportionate enlargement in these\nmeasures, and thus make compensation for ocular deception, a clumsy and\nawkward appearance will be presented to the beholder. With regard to the\nenlargement made at the middle of columns, which among the Greeks is\ncalled [Greek: entasis], at the end of the book a figure and calculation\nwill be subjoined, showing how an agreeable and appropriate effect may\nbe produced by it.\nCHAPTER IV\nTHE FOUNDATIONS AND SUBSTRUCTURES OF TEMPLES\n1. The foundations of these works should be dug out of the solid ground,\nif it can be found, and carried down into solid ground as far as the\nmagnitude of the work shall seem to require, and the whole substructure\nshould be as solid as it can possibly be laid. Above ground, let walls\nbe laid under the columns, thicker by one half than the columns are to\nbe, so that the lower may be stronger than the higher. Hence they are\ncalled \"stereobates\"; for they take the load. And the projections of the\nbases should not extend beyond this solid foundation. The wall-thickness\nis similarly to be preserved above ground likewise, and the intervals\nbetween these walls should be vaulted over, or filled with earth rammed\ndown hard, to keep the walls well apart.\n[Illustration: THE ENTASIS OF COLUMNS\n1. The entasis as given by Fra Giocondo in the edition of 1511.\n2. The entasis from the temple of Mars Ultor in Rome compared with\nVignola's rule for entasis.]\n2. If, however, solid ground cannot be found, but the place proves to be\nnothing but a heap of loose earth to the very bottom, or a marsh, then\nit must be dug up and cleared out and set with piles made of charred\nalder or olive wood or oak, and these must be driven down by machinery,\nvery closely together like bridge-piles, and the intervals between them\nfilled in with charcoal, and finally the foundations are to be laid on\nthem in the most solid form of construction. The foundations having been\nbrought up to the level, the stylobates are next to be put in place.\n3. The columns are then to be distributed over the stylobates in the\nmanner above described: close together in the pycnostyle; in the\nsystyle, diastyle, or eustyle, as they are described and arranged above.\nIn araeostyle temples one is free to arrange them as far apart as one\nlikes. Still, in peripterals, the columns should be so placed that there\nare twice as many intercolumniations on the sides as there are in front;\nfor thus the length of the work will be twice its breadth. Those who\nmake the number of columns double, seem to be in error, because then the\nlength seems to be one intercolumniation longer than it ought to be.\n4. The steps in front must be arranged so that there shall always be an\nodd number of them; for thus the right foot, with which one mounts the\nfirst step, will also be the first to reach the level of the temple\nitself. The rise of such steps should, I think, be limited to not more\nthan ten nor less than nine inches; for then the ascent will not be\ndifficult. The treads of the steps ought to be made not less than a foot\nand a half, and not more than two feet deep. If there are to be steps\nrunning all round the temple, they should be built of the same size.\n5. But if a podium is to be built on three sides round the temple, it\nshould be so constructed that its plinths, bases, dies, coronae, and\ncymatiumare appropriate to the actual stylobate which is to be under the\nbases of the columns.\n[Illustration: FRA GIOCONDO'S IDEA OF THE \"SCAMILLI IMPARES\"\n(From his edition of Vitruvius, Venice, 1511)]\nThe level of the stylobate must be increased along the middle by the\nscamilli impares; for if it is laid perfectly level, it will look to the\neye as though it were hollowed a little. At the end of the book a figure\nwill be found, with a description showing how the scamilli may be made\nto suit this purpose.\nCHAPTER V\nPROPORTIONS OF THE BASE, CAPITALS, AND ENTABLATURE IN THE IONIC ORDER\n1. This finished, let the bases of the columns be set in place, and\nconstructed in such proportions that their height, including the plinth,\nmay be half the thickness of a column, and their projection (called in\nGreek [Greek: ekphora]) the same.[1] Thus in both length and breadth it\nwill be one and one half thicknesses of a column.\n[Note 1: Reading _aeque tantam_ as in new _Rose._ Codd. _sextantem;_\nSchn. _quadrantem._]\n2. If the base is to be in the Attic style, let its height be so divided\nthat the upper part shall be one third part of the thickness of the\ncolumn, and the rest left for the plinth. Then, excluding the plinth,\nlet the rest be divided into four parts, and of these let one fourth\nconstitute the upper torus, and let the other three be divided equally,\none part composing the lower torus, and the other, with its fillets, the\nscotia, which the Greeks call [Greek: trochilos].\n3. But if Ionic bases are to be built, their proportions shall be so\ndetermined that the base may be each way equal in breadth to the\nthickness of a column plus three eighths of the thickness; its height\nthat of the Attic base, and so too its plinth; excluding the plinth, let\nthe rest, which will be a third part of the thickness of a column, be\ndivided into seven parts. Three of these parts constitute the torus at\nthe top, and the other four are to be divided equally, one part\nconstituting the upper trochilus with its astragals and overhang, the\nother left for the lower trochilus. But the lower will seem to be\nlarger, because it will project to the edge of the plinth. The astragals\nmust be one eighth of the trochilus. The projection of the base will be\nthree sixteenths of the thickness of a column.\n[Illustration: THE IONIC ORDER ACCORDING TO VITRUVIUS COMPARED WITH THE\nORDER OF THE MAUSOLEUM AT HALICARNASSUS\nThe difference between the Roman and the Greek relation of the\nbaluster-side of the capital to the echinus is to be noted.]\n4. The bases being thus finished and put in place, the columns are to be\nput in place: the middle columns of the front and rear porticoes\nperpendicular to their own centre; the corner columns, and those which\nare to extend in a line from them along the sides of the temple to the\nright and left, are to be set so that their inner sides, which face\ntoward the cella wall, are perpendicular, but their outer sides in the\nmanner which I have described in speaking of their diminution. Thus, in\nthe design of the temple the lines will be adjusted with due regard to\nthe diminution.\n5. The shafts of the columns having been erected, the rule for the\ncapitals will be as follows. If they are to be cushion-shaped, they\nshould be so proportioned that the abacus is in length and breadth\nequivalent to the thickness of the shaft at its bottom plus one\neighteenth thereof, and the height of the capital, including the\nvolutes, one half of that amount. The faces of the volutes must recede\nfrom the edge of the abacus inwards by one and a half eighteenths of\nthat same amount. Then, the height of the capital is to be divided into\nnine and a half parts, and down along the abacus on the four sides of\nthe volutes, down along the fillet at the edge of the abacus, lines\ncalled \"catheti\" are to be let fall. Then, of the nine and a half parts\nlet one and a half be reserved for the height of the abacus, and let the\nother eight be used for the volutes.\n6. Then let another line be drawn, beginning at a point situated at a\ndistance of one and a half parts toward the inside from the line\npreviously let fall down along the edge of the abacus. Next, let these\nlines be divided in such a way as to leave four and a half parts under\nthe abacus; then, at the point which forms the division between the four\nand a half parts and the remaining three and a half, fix the centre of\nthe eye, and from that centre describe a circle with a diameter equal to\none of the eight parts. This will be the size of the eye, and in it draw\na diameter on the line of the \"cathetus.\" Then, in describing the\nquadrants, let the size of each be successively less, by half the\ndiameter of the eye, than that which begins under the abacus, and\nproceed from the eye until that same quadrant under the abacus is\nreached.\n7. The height of the capital is to be such that, of the nine and a half\nparts, three parts are below the level of the astragal at the top of the\nshaft, and the rest, omitting the abacus and the channel, belongs to\nits echinus. The projection of the echinus beyond the fillet of the\nabacus should be equal to the size of the eye. The projection of the\nbands of the cushions should be thus obtained: place one leg of a pair\nof compasses in the centre of the capital and open out the other to the\nedge of the echinus; bring this leg round and it will touch the outer\nedge of the bands. The axes of the volutes should not be thicker than\nthe size of the eye, and the volutes themselves should be channelled out\nto a depth which is one twelfth of their height. These will be the\nsymmetrical proportions for capitals of columns twenty-five feet high\nand less. For higher columns the other proportions will be the same, but\nthe length and breadth of the abacus will be the thickness of the lower\ndiameter of a column plus one ninth part thereof; thus, just as the\nhigher the column the less the diminution, so the projection of its\ncapital is proportionately increased and its breadth[2] is\ncorrespondingly enlarged.\n[Note 2: Codd. _altitudo_.]\n8. With regard to the method of describing volutes, at the end of the\nbook a figure will be subjoined and a calculation showing how they may\nbe described so that their spirals may be true to the compass.\nThe capitals having been finished and set up in due proportion to the\ncolumns (not exactly level on the columns, however, but with the same\nmeasured adjustment, so that in the upper members there may be an\nincrease corresponding to that which was made in the stylobates), the\nrule for the architraves is to be as follows. If the columns are at\nleast twelve feet and not more than fifteen feet high, let the height of\nthe architrave be equal to half the thickness of a column at the bottom.\nIf they are from fifteen feet to twenty, let the height of a column be\nmeasured off into thirteen parts, and let one of these be the height of\nthe architrave. If they are from twenty to twenty-five feet, let this\nheight be divided into twelve and one half parts, and let one of them\nform the height of the architrave. If they are from twenty-five feet to\nthirty, let it be divided into twelve parts, and let one of them form\nthe height. If they are higher, the heights of the architraves are to be\nworked out proportionately in the same manner from the height of the\ncolumns.\n9. For the higher that the eye has to climb, the less easily can it make\nits way through the thicker and thicker mass of air. So it fails when\nthe height is great, its strength is sucked out of it, and it conveys to\nthe mind only a confused estimate of the dimensions. Hence there must\nalways be a corresponding increase in the symmetrical proportions of the\nmembers, so that whether the buildings are on unusually lofty sites or\nare themselves somewhat colossal, the size of the parts may seem in due\nproportion. The depth of the architrave on its under side just above the\ncapital, is to be equivalent to the thickness of the top of the column\njust under the capital, and on its uppermost side equivalent to the foot\nof the shaft.\n10. The cymatium of the architrave should be one seventh of the height\nof the whole architrave, and its projection the same. Omitting the\ncymatium, the rest of the architrave is to be divided into twelve parts,\nand three of these will form the lowest fascia, four, the next, and\nfive, the highest fascia. The frieze, above the architrave, is one\nfourth less high than the architrave, but if there are to be reliefs\nupon it, it is one fourth higher than the architrave, so that the\nsculptures may be more imposing. Its cymatium is one seventh of the\nwhole height of the frieze, and the projection of the cymatium is the\nsame as its height.\n11. Over the frieze comes the line of dentils, made of the same height\nas the middle fascia of the architrave and with a projection equal to\ntheir height. The intersection (or in Greek [Greek: metop\u00ea]) is\napportioned so that the face of each dentil is half as wide as its\nheight and the cavity of each intersection two thirds of this face in\nwidth. The cymatium here is one sixth of the whole height of this part.\nThe corona with its cymatium, but not including the sima, has the height\nof the middle fascia of the architrave, and the total projection of the\ncorona and dentils should be equal to the height from the frieze to the\ncymatium at the top of the corona.\n[Illustration: A COMPARISON OF THE IONIC ORDER ACCORDING TO VITRUVIUS\nWITH ACTUAL EXAMPLES AND WITH VIGNOLA'S ORDER\nA: Showing the orders reduced to equal lower diameters. B: Showing the\norders to a uniform scale.]\nAnd as a general rule, all projecting parts have greater beauty when\ntheir projection is equal to their height.\n12. The height of the tympanum, which is in the pediment, is to be\nobtained thus: let the front of the corona, from the two ends of its\ncymatium, be measured off into nine parts, and let one of these parts be\nset up in the middle at the peak of the tympanum, taking care that it is\nperpendicular to the entablature and the neckings of the columns. The\ncoronae over the tympanum are to be made of equal size with the coronae\nunder it, not including the simae. Above the coronae are the simae (in\nGreek [Greek: epaietides]), which should be made one eighth higher than\nthe height of the coronae. The acroteria at the corners have the height\nof the centre of the tympanum, and those in the middle are one eighth\npart higher than those at the corners.\n13. All the members which are to be above the capitals of the columns,\nthat is, architraves, friezes, coronae, tympana, gables, and acroteria,\nshould be inclined to the front a twelfth part of their own height, for\nthe reason that when we stand in front of them, if two lines are drawn\nfrom the eye, one reaching to the bottom of the building and the other\nto the top, that which reaches to the top will be the longer. Hence, as\nthe line of sight to the upper part is the longer, it makes that part\nlook as if it were leaning back. But when the members are inclined to\nthe front, as described above, they will seem to the beholder to be\nplumb and perpendicular.\n14. Each column should have twenty-four flutes, channelled out in such a\nway that if a carpenter's square be placed in the hollow of a flute and\nturned, the arm will touch the corners of the fillets on the right and\nleft, and the tip of the square may keep touching some point in the\nconcave surface as it moves through it. The breadth of the flutes is to\nbe equivalent to the enlargement in the middle of a column, which will\nbe found in the figure.\n15. In the simae which are over the coronae on the sides of the temple,\nlion's heads are to be carved and arranged at intervals thus: First one\nhead is marked out directly over the axis of each column, and then the\nothers are arranged at equal distances apart, and so that there shall be\none at the middle of every roof-tiling. Those that are over the columns\nshould have holes bored through them to the gutter which receives the\nrainwater from the tiles, but those between them should be solid. Thus\nthe mass of water that falls by way of the tiles into the gutter will\nnot be thrown down along the intercolumniations nor drench people who\nare passing through them, while the lion's heads that are over the\ncolumns will appear to be vomiting as they discharge streams of water\nfrom their mouths.\nIn this book I have written as clearly as I could on the arrangements of\nIonic temples. In the next I shall explain the proportions of Doric and\nCorinthian temples.\nBOOK IV\nINTRODUCTION\n1. I have observed, Emperor, that many in their treatises and volumes of\ncommentaries on architecture have not presented the subject with\nwell-ordered completeness, but have merely made a beginning and left, as\nit were, only desultory fragments. I have therefore thought that it\nwould be a worthy and very useful thing to reduce the whole of this\ngreat art to a complete and orderly form of presentation, and then in\ndifferent books to lay down and explain the required characteristics of\ndifferent departments. Hence, Caesar, in my first book I have set forth\nto you the function of the architect and the things in which he ought to\nbe trained. In the second I have discussed the supplies of material of\nwhich buildings are constructed. In the third, which deals with the\narrangements of temples and their variety of form, I showed the nature\nand number of their classes, with the adjustments proper to each form\naccording to the usage of the Ionic order, one of the three which\nexhibit the greatest delicacy of proportion in their symmetrical\nmeasurements. In the present book I shall speak of the established rules\nfor the Doric and Corinthian orders, and shall explain their differences\nand peculiarities.\nCHAPTER I\nTHE ORIGINS OF THE THREE ORDERS, AND THE PROPORTIONS OF THE CORINTHIAN\nCAPITAL\n1. Corinthian columns are, excepting in their capitals, of the same\nproportions in all respects as Ionic; but the height of their capitals\ngives them proportionately a taller and more slender effect. This is\nbecause the height of the Ionic capital is only one third of the\nthickness of the column, while that of the Corinthian is the entire\nthickness of the shaft. Hence, as two thirds are added in Corinthian\ncapitals, their tallness gives a more slender appearance to the columns\nthemselves.\n2. The other members which are placed above the columns, are, for\nCorinthian columns, composed either of the Doric proportions or\naccording to the Ionic usages; for the Corinthian order never had any\nscheme peculiar to itself for its cornices or other ornaments, but may\nhave mutules in the coronae and guttae on the architraves according to\nthe triglyph system of the Doric style, or, according to Ionic\npractices, it may be arranged with a frieze adorned with sculptures and\naccompanied with dentils and coronae.\n3. Thus a third architectural order, distinguished by its capital, was\nproduced out of the two other orders. To the forms of their columns are\ndue the names of the three orders, Doric, Ionic, and Corinthian, of\nwhich the Doric was the first to arise, and in early times. For Dorus,\nthe son of Hellen and the nymph Phthia, was king of Achaea and all the\nPeloponnesus, and he built a fane, which chanced to be of this order, in\nthe precinct of Juno at Argolis, a very ancient city, and subsequently\nothers of the same order in the other cities of Achaea, although the\nrules of symmetry were not yet in existence.\n4. Later, the Athenians, in obedience to oracles of the Delphic Apollo,\nand with the general agreement of all Hellas, despatched thirteen\ncolonies at one time to Asia Minor, appointing leaders for each colony\nand giving the command-in-chief to Ion, son of Xuthus and Creusa (whom\nfurther Apollo at Delphi in the oracles had acknowledged as his son).\nIon conducted those colonies to Asia Minor, took possession of the land\nof Caria, and there founded the grand cities of Ephesus, Miletus, Myus\n(long ago engulfed by the water, and its sacred rites and suffrage\nhanded over by the Ionians to the Milesians), Priene, Samos, Teos,\nColophon, Chius, Erythrae, Phocaea, Clazomenae, Lebedos, and Melite.\nThis Melite, on account of the arrogance of its citizens, was destroyed\nby the other cities in a war declared by general agreement, and in its\nplace, through the kindness of King Attalus and Arsinoe, the city of the\nSmyrnaeans was admitted among the Ionians.\n5. Now these cities, after driving out the Carians and Lelegans, called\nthat part of the world Ionia from their leader Ion, and there they set\noff precincts for the immortal gods and began to build fanes: first of\nall, a temple to Panionion Apollo such as they had seen in Achaea,\ncalling it Doric because they had first seen that kind of temple built\nin the states of the Dorians.\n6. Wishing to set up columns in that temple, but not having rules for\ntheir symmetry, and being in search of some way by which they could\nrender them fit to bear a load and also of a satisfactory beauty of\nappearance, they measured the imprint of a man's foot and compared this\nwith his height. On finding that, in a man, the foot was one sixth of\nthe height, they applied the same principle to the column, and reared\nthe shaft, including the capital, to a height six times its thickness at\nits base. Thus the Doric column, as used in buildings, began to exhibit\nthe proportions, strength, and beauty of the body of a man.\n7. Just so afterwards, when they desired to construct a temple to Diana\nin a new style of beauty, they translated these footprints into terms\ncharacteristic of the slenderness of women, and thus first made a column\nthe thickness of which was only one eighth of its height, so that it\nmight have a taller look. At the foot they substituted the base in\nplace of a shoe; in the capital they placed the volutes, hanging down at\nthe right and left like curly ringlets, and ornamented its front with\ncymatia and with festoons of fruit arranged in place of hair, while they\nbrought the flutes down the whole shaft, falling like the folds in the\nrobes worn by matrons. Thus in the invention of the two different kinds\nof columns, they borrowed manly beauty, naked and unadorned, for the\none, and for the other the delicacy, adornment, and proportions\ncharacteristic of women.\n8. It is true that posterity, having made progress in refinement and\ndelicacy of feeling, and finding pleasure in more slender proportions,\nhas established seven diameters of the thickness as the height of the\nDoric column, and nine as that of the Ionic. The Ionians, however,\noriginated the order which is therefore named Ionic.\nThe third order, called Corinthian, is an imitation of the slenderness\nof a maiden; for the outlines and limbs of maidens, being more slender\non account of their tender years, admit of prettier effects in the way\nof adornment.\n9. It is related that the original discovery of this form of capital was\nas follows. A free-born maiden of Corinth, just of marriageable age, was\nattacked by an illness and passed away. After her burial, her nurse,\ncollecting a few little things which used to give the girl pleasure\nwhile she was alive, put them in a basket, carried it to the tomb, and\nlaid it on top thereof, covering it with a roof-tile so that the things\nmight last longer in the open air. This basket happened to be placed\njust above the root of an acanthus. The acanthus root, pressed down\nmeanwhile though it was by the weight, when springtime came round put\nforth leaves and stalks in the middle, and the stalks, growing up along\nthe sides of the basket, and pressed out by the corners of the tile\nthrough the compulsion of its weight, were forced to bend into volutes\nat the outer edges.\n[Illustration: Photo. Sommer\nTHE BASILICA AT POMPEII]\n[Illustration: THE CORINTHIAN CAPITAL OF VITRUVIUS COMPARED WITH THE\nMONUMENTS]\n10. Just then Callimachus, whom the Athenians called [Greek:\nkatat\u00eaxitechnos] for the refinement and delicacy of his artistic\nwork, passed by this tomb and observed the basket with the tender\nyoung leaves growing round it. Delighted with the novel style and form,\nhe built some columns after that pattern for the Corinthians, determined\ntheir symmetrical proportions, and established from that time forth the\nrules to be followed in finished works of the Corinthian order.\n11. The proportions of this capital should be fixed as follows. Let the\nheight of the capital, including its abacus, be equivalent to the\nthickness of the base of a column. Let the breadth of the abacus be\nproportioned so that diagonals drawn from one corner of it to the other\nshall be twice the height of the capitals, which will give the proper\nbreadth to each face of the abacus. The faces should curve inwards, by\none ninth of the breadth of the face, from the outside edge of the\ncorners of the abacus. At the bottom the capital should be of the\nthickness of the top of the column omitting the cong\u00e9 and astragal. The\nheight of the abacus is one seventh of the height of the capital.\n12. Omitting the height of the abacus, let the rest be divided into\nthree parts, of which one should be given to the lowest leaf. Let the\nsecond leaf occupy the middle part of the height. Of the same height\nshould be the stalks, out of which grow leaves projected so as to\nsupport the volutes which proceed from the stalks, and run out to the\nutmost corners of the abacus; the smaller spirals between them should be\ncarved just under the flower which is on the abacus. The flowers on the\nfour sides are to be made as large as the height of the abacus. On these\nprinciples of proportion, Corinthian capitals will be finished as they\nought to be.\nThere are other kinds of capitals set upon these same columns and called\nby various names, but they have no peculiarities of proportion of which\nwe can speak, nor can we recognize from them another order of columns.\nEven their very names are, as we can see, derived with some changes from\nthe Corinthian, the cushion-shaped, and the Doric, whose symmetrical\nproportions have been thus transferred to delicate sculptures of novel\nform.\nCHAPTER II\nTHE ORNAMENTS OF THE ORDERS\n1. Since the origin and invention of the orders of columns have been\ndescribed above, I think it not out of place to speak in the same way\nabout their ornaments, showing how these arose and from what original\nelements they were devised. The upper parts of all buildings contain\ntimber work to which various terms are applied. And not only in its\nterminology but actually in its uses it exhibits variety. The main beams\nare those which are laid upon columns, pilasters, and antae; tie-beams\nand rafters are found in the framing. Under the roof, if the span is\npretty large, are the crossbeams and struts; if it is of moderate\nextent, only the ridgepole, with the principal rafters extending to the\nouter edge of the eaves. Over the principal rafters are the purlines,\nand then above these and under the roof-tiles come the common rafters,\nextending so far that the walls are covered by their projection.\n2. Thus each and every detail has a place, origin, and order of its own.\nIn accordance with these details, and starting from carpenter's work,\nartists in building temples of stone and marble imitated those\narrangements in their sculptures, believing that they must follow those\ninventions. So it was that some ancient carpenters, engaged in building\nsomewhere or other, after laying the tie-beams so that they projected\nfrom the inside to the outside of the walls, closed up the space between\nthe beams, and above them ornamented the coronae and gables with\ncarpentry work of beauty greater than usual; then they cut off the\nprojecting ends of the beams, bringing them into line and flush with the\nface of the walls; next, as this had an ugly look to them, they fastened\nboards, shaped as triglyphs are now made, on the ends of the beams,\nwhere they had been cut off in front, and painted them with blue wax so\nthat the cutting off of the ends of the beams, being concealed, would\nnot offend the eye. Hence it was in imitation of the arrangement of the\ntie-beams that men began to employ, in Doric buildings, the device of\ntriglyphs and the metopes between the beams.\n3. Later, others in other buildings allowed the projecting principal\nrafters to run out till they were flush with the triglyphs, and then\nformed their projections into simae. From that practice, like the\ntriglyphs from the arrangement of the tie-beams, the system of mutules\nunder the coronae was devised from the projections of the principal\nrafters. Hence generally, in buildings of stone and marble, the mutules\nare carved with a downward slant, in imitation of the principal rafters.\nFor these necessarily have a slanting and projecting position to let the\nwater drip down. The scheme of triglyphs and mutules in Doric buildings\nwas, therefore, the imitative device that I have described.\n4. It cannot be that the triglyphs represent windows, as some have\nerroneously said, since the triglyphs are placed at the corners and over\nthe middle of columns--places where, from the nature of the case, there\ncan be no windows at all. For buildings are wholly disconnected at the\ncorners if openings for windows are left at those points. Again, if we\nare to suppose that there were open windows where the triglyphs now\nstand, it will follow, on the same principle, that the dentils of the\nIonic order have likewise taken the places of windows. For the term\n\"metope\" is used of the intervals between dentils as well as of those\nbetween triglyphs. The Greeks call the seats of tie-beams and rafters\n[Greek: opai], while our people call these cavities columbaria\n(dovecotes). Hence, the space between the tie-beams, being the space\nbetween two \"opae,\" was named by them [Greek: metop\u00ea].\n5. The system of triglyphs and mutules was invented for the Doric order,\nand similarly the scheme of dentils belongs to the Ionic, in which there\nare proper grounds for its use in buildings. Just as mutules represent\nthe projection of the principal rafters, so dentils in the Ionic are an\nimitation of the projections of the common rafters. And so in Greek\nworks nobody ever put dentils under mutules, as it is impossible that\ncommon rafters should be underneath principal rafters. Therefore, if\nthat which in the original must be placed above the principal rafters,\nis put in the copy below them, the result will be a work constructed on\nfalse principles. Neither did the ancients approve of or employ mutules\nor dentils in pediments, but only plain coronae, for the reason that\nneither principal nor common rafters tail into the fronts of pediments,\nnor can they overhang them, but they are laid with a slope towards the\neaves. Hence the ancients held that what could not happen in the\noriginal would have no valid reason for existence in the copy.\n6. For in all their works they proceeded on definite principles of\nfitness and in ways derived from the truth of Nature. Thus they reached\nperfection, approving only those things which, if challenged, can be\nexplained on grounds of the truth. Hence, from the sources which have\nbeen described they established and left us the rules of symmetry and\nproportion for each order. Following in their steps, I have spoken above\non the Ionic and Corinthian styles, and I shall now briefly explain the\ntheory of the Doric and its general appearance.\nCHAPTER III\nPROPORTIONS OF DORIC TEMPLES\n1. Some of the ancient architects said that the Doric order ought not to\nbe used for temples, because faults and incongruities were caused by the\nlaws of its symmetry. Arcesius and Pytheos said so, as well as\nHermogenes. He, for instance, after getting together a supply of marble\nfor the construction of a Doric temple, changed his mind and built an\nIonic temple to Father Bacchus with the same materials. This is not\nbecause it is unlovely in appearance or origin or dignity of form, but\nbecause the arrangement of the triglyphs and metopes (lacunaria) is an\nembarrassment and inconvenience to the work.\n2. For the triglyphs ought to be placed so as to correspond to the\ncentres of the columns, and the metopes between the triglyphs ought to\nbe as broad as they are high. But in violation of this rule, at the\ncorner columns triglyphs are placed at the outside edges and not\ncorresponding to the centre of the columns. Hence the metopes next to\nthe corner columns do not come out perfectly square, but are too broad\nby half the width of a triglyph. Those who would make the metopes all\nalike, make the outermost intercolumniations narrower by half the width\nof a triglyph. But the result is faulty, whether it is attained by\nbroader metopes or narrower intercolumniations. For this reason, the\nancients appear to have avoided the scheme of the Doric order in their\ntemples.\n3. However, since our plan calls for it, we set it forth as we have\nreceived it from our teachers, so that if anybody cares to set to work\nwith attention to these laws, he may find the proportions stated by\nwhich he can construct correct and faultless examples of temples in the\nDoric fashion.\nLet the front of a Doric temple, at the place where the columns are put\nup, be divided, if it is to be tetrastyle, into twenty-seven parts; if\nhexastyle, into forty-two. One of these parts will be the module (in\nGreek [Greek: embat\u00eas]); and this module once fixed, all the parts of\nthe work are adjusted by means of calculations based upon it.\n4. The thickness of the columns will be two modules, and their height,\nincluding the capitals, fourteen. The height of a capital will be one\nmodule, and its breadth two and one sixth modules. Let the height of the\ncapital be divided into three parts, of which one will form the abacus\nwith its cymatium, the second the echinus with its annulets, and the\nthird the necking. The diminution of the column should be the same as\ndescribed for Ionic columns in the third book. The height of the\narchitrave, including taenia and guttae, is one module, and of the\ntaenia, one seventh of a module. The guttae, extending as wide as the\ntriglyphs and beneath the taenia, should hang down for one sixth of a\nmodule, including their regula. The depth of the architrave on its under\nside should answer to the necking at the top of the column. Above the\narchitrave, the triglyphs and metopes are to be placed: the triglyphs\none and one half modules high, and one module wide in front. They are to\nbe arranged so that one is placed to correspond to the centre of each\ncorner and intermediate column, and two over each intercolumniation\nexcept the middle intercolumniations of the front and rear porticoes,\nwhich have three each. The intervals in the middle being thus extended,\na free passage will be afforded to those who would approach the statues\nof the gods.\n[Illustration: VITRUVIUS' DORIC ORDER COMPARED WITH THE TEMPLE AT CORI\nAND THE DORIC ORDER OF THE THEATRE OF MARCELLUS]\n5. The width of the triglyph should be divided into six parts, and five\nof these marked off in the middle by means of the rule, and two half\nparts at the right and left. Let one part, that in the centre, form a\n\"femur\" (in Greek [Greek: m\u00earos]). On each side of it are the channels,\nto be cut in to fit the tip of a carpenter's square, and in succession\nthe other femora, one at the right and the other at the left of a\nchannel. To the outsides are relegated the semichannels. The triglyphs\nhaving been thus arranged, let the metopes between the triglyphs be as\nhigh as they are wide, while at the outer corners there should be\nsemimetopes inserted, with the width of half a module.\nIn these ways all defects will be corrected, whether in metopes or\nintercolumniations or lacunaria, as all the arrangements have been made\nwith uniformity.\n6. The capitals of each triglyph are to measure one sixth of a module.\nOver the capitals of the triglyphs the corona is to be placed, with a\nprojection of two thirds of a module, and having a Doric cymatium at the\nbottom and another at the top. So the corona with its cymatia is half a\nmodule in height. Set off on the under side of the corona, vertically\nover the triglyphs and over the middle of the metopes, are the viae in\nstraight lines and the guttae arranged in rows, six guttae broad and\nthree deep. The spaces left (due to the fact that the metopes are\nbroader than the triglyphs) may be left unornamented or may have\nthunderbolts carved on them. Just at the edge of the corona a line\nshould be cut in, called the scotia. All the other parts, such as\ntympana and the simae of the corona, are to be constructed as described\nabove in the case of the Ionic order.\n7. Such will be the scheme established for diastyle buildings. But if\nthe building is to be systyle and monotriglyphic, let the front of the\ntemple, if tetrastyle, be divided into nineteen and a half parts; if\nhexastyle, into twenty-nine and a half parts. One of these parts will\nform the module in accordance with which the adjustments are to be made\nas above described.\n8. Thus, over each portion of the architrave two metopes and two\ntriglyphs[3] will be placed; and, in addition, at the corners half a\ntriglyph and besides a space large enough for a half triglyph. At the\ncentre, vertically under the gable, there should be room for three\ntriglyphs and three metopes, in order that the centre intercolumniation,\nby its greater width, may give ample room for people to enter the\ntemple, and may lend an imposing effect to the view of the statues of\nthe gods.\n[Note 3: That is: two metopes with a triglyph between them, and half\nof the triglyph on either side.]\n9. The columns should be fluted with twenty flutes. If these are to be\nleft plane, only the twenty angles need be marked off. But if they are\nto be channelled out, the contour of the channelling may be determined\nthus: draw a square with sides equal in length to the breadth of the\nfluting, and centre a pair of compasses in the middle of this square.\nThen describe a circle with a circumference touching the angles of the\nsquare, and let the channellings have the contour of the segment formed\nby the circumference and the side of the square. The fluting of the\nDoric column will thus be finished in the style appropriate to it.\n10. With regard to the enlargement to be made in the column at its\nmiddle, let the description given for Ionic columns in the third book be\napplied here also in the case of Doric.\nSince the external appearance of the Corinthian, Doric, and Ionic\nproportions has now been described, it is necessary next to explain the\narrangements of the cella and the pronaos.\nCHAPTER IV\nTHE CELLA AND PRONAOS\n1. The length of a temple is adjusted so that its width may be half its\nlength, and the actual cella one fourth greater in length than in width,\nincluding the wall in which the folding doors are placed. Let the\nremaining three parts, constituting the pronaos, extend to the antae\nterminating the walls, which antae ought to be of the same thickness as\nthe columns. If the temple is to be more than twenty feet in width, let\ntwo columns be placed between the two antae, to separate the pteroma\nfrom the pronaos. The three intercolumniations between the antae and the\ncolumns should be closed by low walls made of marble or of joiner's\nwork, with doors in them to afford passages into the pronaos.\n2. If the width is to be more than forty feet, let columns be placed\ninside and opposite to the columns between the antae. They should have\nthe same height as the columns in front of them, but their thickness\nshould be proportionately reduced: thus, if the columns in front are in\nthickness one eighth of their height, these should be one tenth; if the\nformer are one ninth or one tenth, these should be reduced in the same\nproportion. For their reduction will not be discernible, as the air has\nnot free play about them. Still, in case they look too slender, when the\nouter columns have twenty or twenty-four flutes, these may have\ntwenty-eight or thirty-two. Thus the additional number of flutes will\nmake up proportionately for the loss in the body of the shaft,\npreventing it from being seen, and so in a different way the columns\nwill be made to look equally thick.\n[Illustration: VITRUVIUS' TEMPLE PLAN COMPARED WITH ACTUAL EXAMPLES]\n3. The reason for this result is that the eye, touching thus upon a\ngreater number of points, set closer together, has a larger compass to\ncover with its range of vision. For if two columns, equally thick but\none unfluted and the other fluted, are measured by drawing lines round\nthem, one line touching the body of the columns in the hollows of the\nchannels and on the edges of the flutes, these surrounding lines, even\nthough the columns are equally thick, will not be equal to each other,\nbecause it takes a line of greater length to compass the channels and\nthe flutes. This being granted, it is not improper, in narrow quarters\nor where the space is enclosed, to use in a building columns of somewhat\nslender proportions, since we can help out by a duly proportionate\nnumber of flutings.\n4. The walls of the cella itself should be thick in proportion to its\nsize, provided that their antae are kept of the same thickness as the\ncolumns. If the walls are to be of masonry, let the rubble used be as\nsmall as possible; but if they are to be of dimension stone or marble,\nthe material ought to be of a very moderate and uniform size; for the\nlaying of the stones so as to break joints will make the whole work\nstronger, and their bevelled edges, standing up about the builds and\nbeds, will give it an agreeable look, somewhat like that of a picture.\nCHAPTER V\nHOW THE TEMPLE SHOULD FACE\n1. The quarter toward which temples of the immortal gods ought to face\nis to be determined on the principle that, if there is no reason to\nhinder and the choice is free, the temple and the statue placed in the\ncella should face the western quarter of the sky. This will enable those\nwho approach the altar with offerings or sacrifices to face the\ndirection of the sunrise in facing the statue in the temple, and thus\nthose who are undertaking vows look toward the quarter from which the\nsun comes forth, and likewise the statues themselves appear to be coming\nforth out of the east to look upon them as they pray and sacrifice.\n2. But if the nature of the site is such as to forbid this, then the\nprinciple of determining the quarter should be changed, so that the\nwidest possible view of the city may be had from the sanctuaries of the\ngods. Furthermore, temples that are to be built beside rivers, as in\nEgypt on both sides of the Nile, ought, as it seems, to face the river\nbanks. Similarly, houses of the gods on the sides of public roads should\nbe arranged so that the passers-by can have a view of them and pay their\ndevotions face to face.\nCHAPTER VI\nTHE DOORWAYS OF TEMPLES\n1. For the doorways of temples and their casings the rules are as\nfollows, first determining of what style they are to be. The styles of\nportals are Doric, Ionic, and Attic.\nIn the Doric, the symmetrical proportions are distinguished by the\nfollowing rules. Let the top of the corona, which is laid above the\ncasing, be on a level with the tops of the capitals of the columns in\nthe pronaos. The aperture of the doorway should be determined by\ndividing the height of the temple, from floor to coffered ceiling, into\nthree and one half parts and letting two and one half[4] thereof\nconstitute the height of the aperture of the folding doors. Let this in\nturn be divided into twelve parts, and let five and a half of these form\nthe width of the bottom of the aperture. At the top, this width should\nbe diminished, if the aperture is sixteen feet in height, by one third\nthe width of the door-jamb; if the aperture is from sixteen to\ntwenty-five feet, let the upper part of it be diminished by one quarter\nof the jamb; if from twenty-five to thirty feet, let the top be\ndiminished by one eighth of the jamb. Other and higher apertures should,\nas it seems, have their sides perpendicular.\n[Note 4: Codd. _duae._]\n2. Further, the jambs themselves should be diminished at the top by one\nfourteenth of their width. The height of the lintel should be equivalent\nto the width of the jambs at the top. Its cymatium ought to be one sixth\nof the jamb, with a projection equivalent to its height. The style of\ncarving of the cymatium with its astragal should be the Lesbian. Above\nthe cymatium of the lintel, place the frieze of the doorway, of the\nsame height as the lintel, and having a Doric cymatium and Lesbian\nastragal carved upon it. Let the corona and its cymatium at the top of\nall be carved without ornamentation, and have a projection equal to its\nheight. To the right and left of the lintel, which rests upon the jambs,\nthere are to be projections fashioned like projecting bases and jointed\nto a nicety with the cymatium itself.\n3. If the doorways are to be of the Ionic style, the height of the\naperture should be reached in the same manner as in the Doric. Let its\nwidth be determined by dividing the height into two and one half parts\nand letting one of them form the width at the bottom. The diminutions\nshould be the same as for Doric. The width of the faces of the jambs\nshould be one fourteenth of the height of the aperture, and the cymatium\none sixth of the width. Let the rest, excluding the cymatium, be divided\ninto twelve parts. Let three of these compose the first fascia with its\nastragal, four the second, and five the third, the fasciae with their\nastragals running side by side all round.\n4. The cornices of Ionic doorways should be constructed in the same\nmanner as those of Doric, in due proportions. The consoles, otherwise\ncalled brackets, carved at the right and left, should hang down to the\nlevel of the bottom of the lintel, exclusive of the leaf. Their width on\nthe face should be two thirds of the width of the jamb, but at the\nbottom one fourth slenderer than above.\nDoors should be constructed with the hinge-stiles one twelfth of the\nwidth of the whole aperture. The panels between two stiles should each\noccupy three of the twelve parts.\n5. The rails will be apportioned thus: divide the height into five\nparts, of which assign two to the upper portion and three to the lower;\nabove the centre place the middle rails; insert the others at the top\nand at the bottom. Let the height of a rail be one third of the breadth\nof a panel, and its cymatium one sixth of the rail. The width of the\nmeeting-stiles should be one half the rail, and the cover-joint two\nthirds of the rail. The stiles toward the side of the jambs should be\none half the rail. If the doors have folds in them, the height will\nremain as before, but the width should be double that of a single door;\nif the door is to have four folds, its height should be increased.\n[Illustration: VITRUVIUS' RULE FOR DOORWAYS COMPARED WITH TWO EXAMPLES]\n6. Attic doorways are built with the same proportions as Doric. Besides,\nthere are fasciae running all round under the cymatia on the jambs, and\napportioned so as to be equal to three sevenths of a jamb, excluding the\ncymatium. The doors are without lattice-work, are not double but have\nfolds in them, and open outward.\nThe laws which should govern the design of temples built in the Doric,\nIonic, and Corinthian styles, have now, so far as I could arrive at\nthem, been set forth according to what may be called the accepted\nmethods. I shall next speak of the arrangements in the Tuscan style,\nshowing how they should be treated.\nCHAPTER VII\nTUSCAN TEMPLES\n1. The place where the temple is to be built having been divided on its\nlength into six parts, deduct one and let the rest be given to its\nwidth. Then let the length be divided into two equal parts, of which let\nthe inner be reserved as space for the cellae, and the part next the\nfront left for the arrangement of the columns.\n2. Next let the width be divided into ten parts. Of these, let three on\nthe right and three on the left be given to the smaller cellae, or to\nthe alae if there are to be alae, and the other four devoted to the\nmiddle of the temple. Let the space in front of the cellae, in the\npronaos, be marked out for columns thus: the corner columns should be\nplaced opposite the antae on the line of the outside walls; the two\nmiddle columns, set out on the line of the walls which are between the\nantae and the middle of the temple; and through the middle, between the\nantae and the front columns, a second row, arranged on the same lines.\nLet the thickness of the columns at the bottom be one seventh of their\nheight, their height one third of the width of the temple, and the\ndiminution of a column at the top, one fourth of its thickness at the\nbottom.\n[Illustration: THE TUSCAN TEMPLE ACCORDING TO VITRUVIUS.]\n3. The height of their bases should be one half of that thickness. The\nplinth of their bases should be circular, and in height one half the\nheight of the bases, the torus above it and cong\u00e9 being of the same\nheight as the plinth. The height of the capital is one half the\nthickness of a column. The abacus has a width equivalent to the\nthickness of the bottom of a column. Let the height of the capital be\ndivided into three parts, and give one to the plinth (that is, the\nabacus), the second to the echinus, and the third to the necking with\nits cong\u00e9.\n4. Upon the columns lay the main beams, fastened together, to a height\ncommensurate with the requirements of the size of the building. These\nbeams fastened together should be laid so as to be equivalent in\nthickness to the necking at the top of a column, and should be fastened\ntogether by means of dowels and dove-tailed tenons in such a way that\nthere shall be a space two fingers broad between them at the fastening.\nFor if they touch one another, and so do not leave airholes and admit\ndraughts of air to blow between them, they get heated and soon begin to\nrot.\n5. Above the beams and walls let the mutules project to a distance equal\nto one quarter of the height of a column; along the front of them nail\ncasings; above, build the tympanum of the pediment either in masonry or\nin wood. The pediment with its ridgepole, principal rafters, and\npurlines are to be built in such a way that the eaves shall be\nequivalent to one third of the completed roof.\nCHAPTER VIII\nCIRCULAR TEMPLES AND OTHER VARIETIES\n1. There are also circular temples, some of which are constructed in\nmonopteral form, surrounded by columns but without a cella, while\nothers are termed peripteral. Those that are without a cella have a\nraised platform and a flight of steps leading to it, one third of the\ndiameter of the temple. The columns upon the stylobates are constructed\nof a height equivalent to the diameter taken between the outer edges of\nthe stylobate walls, and of a thickness equivalent to one tenth of their\nheight including the capitals and bases. The architrave has the height\nof one half of the thickness of a column. The frieze and the other parts\nplaced above it are such as I have described in the third[5] book, on\nthe subject of symmetrical proportions.\n[Illustration: _Photo. Anderson_\nTHE CIRCULAR TEMPLE AT TIVOLI]\n[Illustration: THE MAISON CARR\u00c9E AT N\u00ceMES, A PSEUDO-PERIPTERAL TEMPLE]\n[Note 5: 1 Codd. _quarto._]\n[Illustration: TEMPLE AT TIVOLI]\n[Illustration: _From Durm_\nPLAN OF THE TEMPLE OF VESTA AT ROME]\n2. But if such a temple is to be constructed in peripteral form, let two\nsteps and then the stylobate be constructed below. Next, let the cella\nwall be set up, recessed within the stylobate about one fifth of the\nbreadth thereof, and let a place for folding doors be left in the middle\nto afford entrance. This cella, excluding its walls and the passage\nround the outside, should have a diameter equivalent to the height of a\ncolumn above the stylobate. Let the columns round the cella be arranged\nin the symmetrical proportions just given.\n3. The proportions of the roof in the centre should be such that the\nheight of the rotunda, excluding the finial, is equivalent to one half\nthe diameter of the whole work. The finial, excluding its pyramidal\nbase, should have the dimensions of the capital of a column. All the\nrest must be built in the symmetrical proportions described above.\n[Illustration: _From Durm_\nTHE CIRCULAR TEMPLE ACCORDING TO VITRUVIUS]\n4. There are also other kinds of temples, constructed in the same\nsymmetrical proportions and yet with a different kind of plan: for\nexample, the temple of Castor in the district of the Circus Flaminius,\nthat of Vejovis between the two groves, and still more ingeniously the\ntemple of Diana in her sacred grove, with columns added on the right and\nleft at the flanks of the pronaos. Temples of this kind, like that of\nCastor in the Circus, were first built in Athens on the Acropolis, and\nin Attica at Sunium to Pallas Minerva. The proportions of them are not\ndifferent, but the same as usual. For the length of their cellae is\ntwice the width, as in other temples; but all that we regularly find in\nthe fronts of others is in these transferred to the sides.\n5. Some take the arrangement of columns belonging to the Tuscan order\nand apply it to buildings in the Corinthian and Ionic styles, and where\nthere are projecting antae in the pronaos, set up two columns in a line\nwith each of the cella walls, thus making a combination of the\nprinciples of Tuscan and Greek buildings.\n6. Others actually remove the temple walls, transferring them to the\nintercolumniations, and thus, by dispensing with the space needed for a\npteroma, greatly increase the extent of the cella. So, while leaving all\nthe rest in the same symmetrical proportions, they appear to have\nproduced a new kind of plan with the new name \"pseudoperipteral.\" These\nkinds, however, vary according to the requirements of the sacrifices.\nFor we must not build temples according to the same rules to all gods\nalike, since the performance of the sacred rites varies with the various\ngods.\n7. I have now set forth, as they have come down to me, all the\nprinciples governing the building of temples, have marked out under\nseparate heads their arrangements and proportions, and have set forth,\nso far as I could express them in writing, the differences in their\nplans and the distinctions which make them unlike one another. Next,\nwith regard to the altars of the immortal gods, I shall state how they\nmay be constructed so as to conform to the rules governing sacrifices.\nCHAPTER IX\nALTARS\nAltars should face the east, and should always be placed on a lower\nlevel than are the statues in the temples, so that those who are praying\nand sacrificing may look upwards towards the divinity. They are of\ndifferent heights, being each regulated so as to be appropriate to its\nown god. Their heights are to be adjusted thus: for Jupiter and all the\ncelestials, let them be constructed as high as possible; for Vesta and\nMother Earth, let them be built low. In accordance with these rules\nwill altars be adjusted when one is preparing his plans.\nHaving described the arrangements of temples in this book, in the\nfollowing we shall give an exposition of the construction of public\nbuildings.\nBOOK V\nINTRODUCTION\n1. Those who have filled books of unusually large size, Emperor, in\nsetting forth their intellectual ideas and doctrines, have thus made a\nvery great and remarkable addition to the authority of their writings. I\ncould wish that circumstances made this as permissible in the case of\nour subject, so that the authority of the present treatise might be\nincreased by amplifications; but this is not so easy as it may be\nthought. Writing on architecture is not like history or poetry. History\nis captivating to the reader from its very nature; for it holds out the\nhope of various novelties. Poetry, with its measures and metrical feet,\nits refinement in the arrangement of words, and the delivery in verse of\nthe sentiments expressed by the several characters to one another,\ndelights the feelings of the reader, and leads him smoothly on to the\nvery end of the work.\n2. But this cannot be the case with architectural treatises, because\nthose terms which originate in the peculiar needs of the art, give rise\nto obscurity of ideas from the unusual nature of the language. Hence,\nwhile the things themselves are not well known, and their names not in\ncommon use, if besides this the principles are described in a very\ndiffuse fashion without any attempt at conciseness and explanation in a\nfew pellucid sentences, such fullness and amplitude of treatment will be\nonly a hindrance, and will give the reader nothing but indefinite\nnotions. Therefore, when I mention obscure terms, and the symmetrical\nproportions of members of buildings, I shall give brief explanations, so\nthat they may be committed to memory; for thus expressed, the mind will\nbe enabled to understand them the more easily.\n3. Furthermore, since I have observed that our citizens are distracted\nwith public affairs and private business, I have thought it best to\nwrite briefly, so that my readers, whose intervals of leisure are small,\nmay be able to comprehend in a short time.\nThen again, Pythagoras and those who came after him in his school\nthought it proper to employ the principles of the cube in composing\nbooks on their doctrines, and, having determined that the cube consisted\nof 216[6] lines, held that there should be no more than three cubes in\nany one treatise.\n[Note 6: Codd. _CC. & L._]\n4. A cube is a body with sides all of equal breadth and their surfaces\nperfectly square. When thrown down, it stands firm and steady so long as\nit is untouched, no matter on which of its sides it has fallen, like the\ndice which players throw on the board. The Pythagoreans appear to have\ndrawn their analogy from the cube, because the number of lines mentioned\nwill be fixed firmly and steadily in the memory when they have once\nsettled down, like a cube, upon a man's understanding. The Greek comic\npoets, also, divided their plays into parts by introducing a choral\nsong, and by this partition on the principle of the cubes, they relieve\nthe actor's speeches by such intermissions.\n5. Since these rules, founded on the analogy of nature, were followed by\nour predecessors, and since I observe that I have to write on unusual\nsubjects which many persons will find obscure, I have thought it best to\nwrite in short books, so that they may the more readily strike the\nunderstanding of the reader: for they will thus be easy to comprehend. I\nhave also arranged them so that those in search of knowledge on a\nsubject may not have to gather it from different places, but may find it\nin one complete treatment, with the various classes set forth each in a\nbook by itself. Hence, Caesar, in the third and fourth books I gave the\nrules for temples; in this book I shall treat of the laying out of\npublic places. I shall speak first of the proper arrangement of the\nforum, for in it the course of both public and private affairs is\ndirected by the magistrates.\nCHAPTER I\nTHE FORUM AND BASILICA\n1. The Greeks lay out their forums in the form of a square surrounded by\nvery spacious double colonnades, adorn them with columns set rather\nclosely together, and with entablatures of stone or marble, and\nconstruct walks above in the upper story. But in the cities of Italy the\nsame method cannot be followed, for the reason that it is a custom\nhanded down from our ancestors that gladiatorial shows should be given\nin the forum.\n[Illustration: _From Gsell_\nFORUM AT TIMGAD\nA, Forum. B, Basilica. C, Curia. C', Official Building. D, Small Temple.\nE, Latrina. F, Atrium.]\n2. Therefore let the intercolumniations round the show place be pretty\nwide; round about in the colonnades put the bankers' offices; and have\nbalconies on the upper floor properly arranged so as to be convenient,\nand to bring in some public revenue.\nThe size of a forum should be proportionate to the number of\ninhabitants, so that it may not be too small a space to be useful, nor\nlook like a desert waste for lack of population. To determine its\nbreadth, divide its length into three parts and assign two of them to\nthe breadth. Its shape will then be oblong, and its ground plan\nconveniently suited to the conditions of shows.\n3. The columns of the upper tier should be one fourth smaller than those\nof the lower, because, for the purpose of bearing the load, what is\nbelow ought to be stronger than what is above, and also, because we\nought to imitate nature as seen in the case of things growing; for\nexample, in round smooth-stemmed trees, like the fir, cypress, and pine,\nevery one of which is rather thick just above the roots and then, as it\ngoes on increasing in height, tapers off naturally and symmetrically in\ngrowing up to the top. Hence, if nature requires this in things growing,\nit is the right arrangement that what is above should be less in height\nand thickness than what is below.\n4. Basilicas should be constructed on a site adjoining the forum and in\nthe warmest possible quarter, so that in winter business men may gather\nin them without being troubled by the weather. In breadth they should be\nnot less than one third nor more than one half of their length, unless\nthe site is naturally such as to prevent this and to oblige an\nalteration in these proportions. If the length of the site is greater\nthan necessary, Chalcidian porches may be constructed at the ends, as in\nthe Julia Aquiliana.\n5. It is thought that the columns of basilicas ought to be as high as\nthe side-aisles are broad; an aisle should be limited to one third of\nthe breadth which the open space in the middle is to have. Let the\ncolumns of the upper tier be smaller than those of the lower, as written\nabove. The screen, to be placed between the upper and the lower tiers of\ncolumns, ought to be, it is thought, one fourth lower than the columns\nof the upper tier, so that people walking in the upper story of the\nbasilica may not be seen by the business men. The architraves, friezes,\nand cornices should be adjusted to the proportions of the columns, as\nwe have stated in the third book.\n[Illustration: _From Mau_\nFORUM AT POMPEII\nA, Forum. B, Basilica. C, Temple of Apollo. D, D', Market Buildings. E,\nLatrina. F, City Treasury. G, Memorial Arch. H, Temple of Jupiter. I,\nArch of Tiberius. K, Macellum (provision market). L, Sanctuary of the\nCity Lares. M, Temple of Vespasian. N, Building of Eumachia. O,\nComitium. P, Office of the Duumvirs. Q, The City Council. R, Office of\nthe Aediles.]\n6. But basilicas of the greatest dignity and beauty may also be\nconstructed in the style of that one which I erected, and the building\nof which I superintended at Fano. Its proportions and symmetrical\nrelations were established as follows. In the middle, the main roof\nbetween the columns is 120 feet long and sixty feet wide. Its aisle\nround the space beneath the main roof and between the walls and the\ncolumns is twenty feet broad. The columns, of unbroken height, measuring\nwith their capitals fifty feet, and being each five feet thick, have\nbehind them pilasters, twenty feet high, two and one half feet broad,\nand one and one half feet thick, which support the beams on which is\ncarried the upper flooring of the aisles. Above them are other\npilasters, eighteen feet high, two feet broad, and a foot thick, which\ncarry the beams supporting the principal raftering and the roof of the\naisles, which is brought down lower than the main roof.\n[Illustration: _From Durm_\nPLAN OF THE BASILICA AT POMPEII]\n7. The spaces remaining between the beams supported by the pilasters and\nthe columns, are left for windows between the intercolumniations. The\ncolumns are: on the breadth of the main roof at each end, four,\nincluding the corner columns at right and left; on the long side which\nis next to the forum, eight, including the same corner columns; on the\nother side, six, including the corner columns. This is because the two\nmiddle columns on that side are omitted, in order not to obstruct the\nview of the pronaos of the temple of Augustus (which is built at the\nmiddle of the side wall of the basilica, facing the middle of the forum\nand the temple of Jupiter) and also the tribunal which is in the former\ntemple, shaped as a hemicycle whose curvature is less than a semicircle.\n[Illustration: VITRUVIUS' BASILICA AT FANO]\n8. The open side of this hemicycle is forty-six feet along the front,\nand its curvature inwards is fifteen feet, so that those who are\nstanding before the magistrates may not be in the way of the business\nmen in the basilica. Round about, above the columns, are placed the\narchitraves, consisting of three two-foot timbers fastened together.\nThese return from the columns which stand third on the inner side to the\nantae which project from the pronaos, and which touch the edges of the\nhemicycle at right and left.\n9. Above the architraves and regularly dispersed on supports directly\nover the capitals, piers are placed, three feet high and four feet broad\neach way. Above them is placed the projecting cornice round about, made\nof two two-foot timbers. The tie-beams and struts, being placed above\nthem, and directly over the shafts of the columns and the antae and\nwalls of the pronaos, hold up one gable roof along the entire basilica,\nand another from the middle of it, over the pronaos of the temple.\n10. Thus the gable tops run in two directions, like the letter T, and\ngive a beautiful effect to the outside and inside of the main roof.\nFurther, by the omission of an ornamental entablature and of a line of\nscreens and a second tier of columns, troublesome labour is saved and\nthe total cost greatly diminished. On the other hand, the carrying of\nthe columns themselves in unbroken height directly up to the beams that\nsupport the main roof, seems to add an air of sumptuousness and dignity\nto the work.\nCHAPTER II\nTHE TREASURY, PRISON, AND SENATE HOUSE\n1. The treasury, prison, and senate house ought to adjoin the forum, but\nin such a way that their dimensions may be proportionate to those of the\nforum. Particularly, the senate house should be constructed with special\nregard to the importance of the town or city. If the building is square,\nlet its height be fixed at one and one half times its breadth; but if it\nis to be oblong, add together its length and breadth and, having got the\ntotal, let half of it be devoted to the height up to the coffered\nceiling.\n2. Further, the inside walls should be girdled, at a point halfway up\ntheir height, with coronae made of woodwork or of stucco. Without these,\nthe voice of men engaged in discussion there will be carried up to the\nheight above, and so be unintelligible to their listeners. But when the\nwalls are girdled with coronae, the voice from below, being detained\nbefore rising and becoming lost in the air, will be intelligible to the\near.\nCHAPTER III\nTHE THEATRE: ITS SITE, FOUNDATIONS AND ACOUSTICS\n1. After the forum has been arranged, next, for the purpose of seeing\nplays or festivals of the immortal gods, a site as healthy as possible\nshould be selected for the theatre, in accordance with what has been\nwritten in the first book, on the principles of healthfulness in the\nsites of cities. For when plays are given, the spectators, with their\nwives and children, sit through them spell-bound, and their bodies,\nmotionless from enjoyment, have the pores open, into which blowing winds\nfind their way. If these winds come from marshy districts or from other\nunwholesome quarters, they will introduce noxious exhalations into the\nsystem. Hence, such faults will be avoided if the site of the theatre is\nsomewhat carefully selected.\n2. We must also beware that it has not a southern exposure. When the sun\nshines full upon the rounded part of it, the air, being shut up in the\ncurved enclosure and unable to circulate, stays there and becomes\nheated; and getting glowing hot it burns up, dries out, and impairs the\nfluids of the human body. For these reasons, sites which are unwholesome\nin such respects are to be avoided, and healthy sites selected.\n3. The foundation walls will be an easier matter if they are on a\nhillside; but if they have to be laid on a plain or in a marshy place,\nsolidity must be assured and substructures built in accordance with what\nhas been written in the third book, on the foundations of temples. Above\nthe foundation walls, the ascending rows of seats, from the\nsubstructures up, should be built of stone and marble materials.\n4. The curved cross-aisles should be constructed in proportionate\nrelation, it is thought, to the height of the theatre, but not higher\nthan the footway of the passage is broad. If they are loftier, they will\nthrow back the voice and drive it away from the upper portion, thus\npreventing the case-endings of words from reaching with distinct meaning\nthe ears of those who are in the uppermost seats above the cross-aisles.\nIn short, it should be so contrived that a line drawn from the lowest to\nthe highest seat will touch the top edges and angles of all the seats.\nThus the voice will meet with no obstruction.\n5. The different entrances ought to be numerous and spacious, the upper\nnot connected with the lower, but built in a continuous straight line\nfrom all parts of the house, without turnings, so that the people may\nnot be crowded together when let out from shows, but may have separate\nexits from all parts without obstructions.\nParticular pains must also be taken that the site be not a \"deaf\" one,\nbut one through which the voice can range with the greatest clearness.\nThis can be brought about if a site is selected where there is no\nobstruction due to echo.\n6. Voice is a flowing breath of air, perceptible to the hearing by\ncontact. It moves in an endless number of circular rounds, like the\ninnumerably increasing circular waves which appear when a stone is\nthrown into smooth water, and which keep on spreading indefinitely from\nthe centre unless interrupted by narrow limits, or by some obstruction\nwhich prevents such waves from reaching their end in due formation. When\nthey are interrupted by obstructions, the first waves, flowing back,\nbreak up the formation of those which follow.\n7. In the same manner the voice executes its movements in concentric\ncircles; but while in the case of water the circles move horizontally on\na plane surface, the voice not only proceeds horizontally, but also\nascends vertically by regular stages. Therefore, as in the case of the\nwaves formed in the water, so it is in the case of the voice: the first\nwave, when there is no obstruction to interrupt it, does not break up\nthe second or the following waves, but they all reach the ears of the\nlowest and highest spectators without an echo.\n8. Hence the ancient architects, following in the footsteps of nature,\nperfected the ascending rows of seats in theatres from their\ninvestigations of the ascending voice, and, by means of the canonical\ntheory of the mathematicians and that of the musicians, endeavoured to\nmake every voice uttered on the stage come with greater clearness and\nsweetness to the ears of the audience. For just as musical instruments\nare brought to perfection of clearness in the sound of their strings by\nmeans of bronze plates or horn [Greek: \u00eacheia], so the ancients devised\nmethods of increasing the power of the voice in theatres through the\napplication of harmonics.\nCHAPTER IV\nHARMONICS\n1. Harmonics is an obscure and difficult branch of musical science,\nespecially for those who do not know Greek. If we desire to treat of it,\nwe must use Greek words, because some of them have no Latin equivalents.\nHence, I will explain it as clearly as I can from the writings of\nAristoxenus, append his scheme, and define the boundaries of the notes,\nso that with somewhat careful attention anybody may be able to\nunderstand it pretty easily.\n2. The voice, in its changes of position when shifting pitch, becomes\nsometimes high, sometimes low, and its movements are of two kinds, in\none of which its progress is continuous, in the other by intervals. The\ncontinuous voice does not become stationary at the \"boundaries\" or at\nany definite place, and so the extremities of its progress are not\napparent, but the fact that there are differences of pitch is apparent,\nas in our ordinary speech in _sol_, _lux_, _flos_, _vox_; for in these\ncases we cannot tell at what pitch the voice begins, nor at what pitch\nit leaves off, but the fact that it becomes low from high and high from\nlow is apparent to the ear. In its progress by intervals the opposite is\nthe case. For here, when the pitch shifts, the voice, by change of\nposition, stations itself on one pitch, then on another, and, as it\nfrequently repeats this alternating process, it appears to the senses to\nbecome stationary, as happens in singing when we produce a variation of\nthe mode by changing the pitch of the voice. And so, since it moves by\nintervals, the points at which it begins and where it leaves off are\nobviously apparent in the boundaries of the notes, but the intermediate\npoints escape notice and are obscure, owing to the intervals.\n3. There are three classes of modes: first, that which the Greeks term\nthe enharmonic; second, the chromatic; third, the diatonic. The\nenharmonic mode is an artistic conception, and therefore execution in it\nhas a specially severe dignity and distinction. The chromatic, with its\ndelicate subtlety and with the \"crowding\" of its notes, gives a sweeter\nkind of pleasure. In the diatonic, the distance between the intervals is\neasier to understand, because it is natural. These three classes differ\nin their arrangement of the tetrachord. In the enharmonic, the\ntetrachord consists of two tones and two \"dieses.\" A diesis is a quarter\ntone; hence in a semitone there are included two dieses. In the\nchromatic there are two semitones arranged in succession, and the third\ninterval is a tone and a half. In the diatonic, there are two\nconsecutive tones, and the third interval of a semitone completes the\ntetrachord. Hence, in the three classes, the tetrachords are equally\ncomposed of two tones and a semitone, but when they are regarded\nseparately according to the terms of each class, they differ in the\narrangement of their intervals.\n4. Now then, these intervals of tones and semitones of the tetrachord\nare a division introduced by nature in the case of the voice, and she\nhas defined their limits by measures according to the magnitude of the\nintervals, and determined their characteristics in certain different\nways. These natural laws are followed by the skilled workmen who fashion\nmusical instruments, in bringing them to the perfection of their proper\nconcords.\n[Illustration]\n5. In each class there are eighteen notes, termed in Greek [Greek:\nphthongoi], of which eight in all the three classes are constant and\nfixed, while the other ten, not being tuned to the same pitch, are\nvariable. The fixed notes are those which, being placed between the\nmoveable, make up the unity of the tetrachord, and remain unaltered in\ntheir boundaries according to the different classes. Their names are\nproslambanomenos, hypate hypaton, hypate meson, mese, nete synhemmenon,\nparamese, nete diezeugmenon, nete hyperbolaeon. The moveable notes are\nthose which, being arranged in the tetrachord between the immoveable,\nchange from place to place according to the different classes. They are\ncalled parhypate hypaton, lichanos hypaton, parhypate meson, lichanos\nmeson, trite synhemmenon, paranete synhemmenon, trite diezeugmenon,\nparanete diezeugmenon, trite hyperbolaeon, paranete hyperbolaeon.\n[Illustration]\n6. These notes, from being moveable, take on different qualities; for\nthey may stand at different intervals and increasing distances. Thus,\nparhypate, which in the enharmonic is at the interval of half a semitone\nfrom hypate, has a semitone interval when transferred to the chromatic.\nWhat is called lichanos in the enharmonic is at the interval of a\nsemitone from hypate; but when shifted to the chromatic, it goes two\nsemitones away; and in the diatonic it is at an interval of three\nsemitones from hypate. Hence the ten notes produce three different kinds\nof modes on account of their changes of position in the classes.\n7. There are five tetrachords: first, the lowest, termed in Greek\n[Greek: hypaton]; second, the middle, called [Greek: meson]; third, the\nconjunct, termed [Greek: syn\u00eammenon]; fourth, the disjunct, named\n[Greek: diezeugmenon]; the fifth, which is the highest, is termed in\nGreek [Greek: hyperbolaion]. The concords, termed in Greek [Greek:\nsymph\u00f4niai], of which human modulation will naturally admit, are six in\nnumber: the fourth, the fifth, the octave, the octave and fourth, the\noctave and fifth, and the double octave.\n8. Their names are therefore due to numerical value; for when the voice\nbecomes stationary on some one note, and then, shifting its pitch,\nchanges its position and passes to the limit of the fourth note from\nthat one, we use the term \"fourth\"; when it passes to the fifth, the\nterm is \"fifth.\"[7]\n[Note 7: The remainder of this section is omitted from the\ntranslation as being an obvious interpolation.]\n9. For there can be no consonances either in the case of the notes of\nstringed instruments or of the singing voice, between two intervals or\nbetween three or six or seven; but, as written above, it is only the\nharmonies of the fourth, the fifth, and so on up to the double octave,\nthat have boundaries naturally corresponding to those of the voice: and\nthese concords are produced by the union of the notes.\nCHAPTER V\nSOUNDING VESSELS IN THE THEATRE\n1. In accordance with the foregoing investigations on mathematical\nprinciples, let bronze vessels be made, proportionate to the size of the\ntheatre, and let them be so fashioned that, when touched, they may\nproduce with one another the notes of the fourth, the fifth, and so on\nup to the double octave. Then, having constructed niches in between the\nseats of the theatre, let the vessels be arranged in them, in accordance\nwith musical laws, in such a way that they nowhere touch the wall, but\nhave a clear space all round them and room over their tops. They should\nbe set upside down, and be supported on the side facing the stage by\nwedges not less than half a foot high. Opposite each niche, apertures\nshould be left in the surface of the seat next below, two feet long and\nhalf a foot deep.\n2. The arrangement of these vessels, with reference to the situations in\nwhich they should be placed, may be described as follows. If the theatre\nbe of no great size, mark out a horizontal range halfway up, and in it\nconstruct thirteen arched niches with twelve equal spaces between them,\nso that of the above mentioned \"echea\" those which give the note nete\nhyperbolaeon may be placed first on each side, in the niches which are\nat the extreme ends; next to the ends and a fourth below in pitch, the\nnote nete diezeugmenon; third, paramese, a fourth below; fourth, nete\nsynhemmenon; fifth, mese, a fourth below; sixth, hypate meson, a fourth\nbelow; and in the middle and another fourth below, one vessel giving the\nnote hypate hypaton.\n3. On this principle of arrangement, the voice, uttered from the stage\nas from a centre, and spreading and striking against the cavities of the\ndifferent vessels, as it comes in contact with them, will be increased\nin clearness of sound, and will wake an harmonious note in unison with\nitself.\nBut if the theatre be rather large, let its height be divided into four\nparts, so that three horizontal ranges of niches may be marked out and\nconstructed: one for the enharmonic, another for the chromatic, and the\nthird for the diatonic system. Beginning with the bottom range, let the\narrangement be as described above in the case of a smaller theatre, but\non the enharmonic system.\n[Illustration]\n4. In the middle range, place first at the extreme ends the vessels\nwhich give the note of the chromatic hyperbolaeon; next to them, those\nwhich give the chromatic diezeugmenon, a fourth below; third, the\nchromatic synhemmenon; fourth, the chromatic meson, a fourth below;\nfifth, the chromatic hypaton, a fourth below; sixth, the paramese, for\nthis is both the concord of the fifth to the chromatic hyperbolaeon, and\nthe concord[8] of the chromatic synhemmenon.\n[Note 8: Codd. _diatessaron_, which is impossible, paramese being\nthe concord of the fourth to the chromatic meson, and identical with the\nchromatic synhemmenon.]\n5. No vessel is to be placed in the middle, for the reason that there is\nno other note in the chromatic system that forms a natural concord of\nsound.\nIn the highest division and range of niches, place at the extreme ends\nvessels fashioned so as to give the note of the diatonic hyperbolaeon;\nnext, the diatonic diezeugmenon, a fourth below; third, the diatonic\nsynhemmenon; fourth, the diatonic meson, a fourth below; fifth, the\ndiatonic hypaton, a fourth below; sixth, the proslambanomenos, a fourth\nbelow; in the middle, the note mese, for this is both the octave to\nproslambanomenos, and the concord of the fifth to the diatonic hypaton.\n6. Whoever wishes to carry out these principles with ease, has only to\nconsult the scheme at the end of this book, drawn up in accordance with\nthe laws of music. It was left by Aristoxenus, who with great ability\nand labour classified and arranged in it the different modes. In\naccordance with it, and by giving heed to these theories, one can easily\nbring a theatre to perfection, from the point of view of the nature of\nthe voice, so as to give pleasure to the audience.\n7. Somebody will perhaps say that many theatres are built every year in\nRome, and that in them no attention at all is paid to these principles;\nbut he will be in error, from the fact that all our public theatres made\nof wood contain a great deal of boarding, which must be resonant. This\nmay be observed from the behaviour of those who sing to the lyre, who,\nwhen they wish to sing in a higher key, turn towards the folding doors\non the stage, and thus by their aid are reinforced with a sound in\nharmony with the voice. But when theatres are built of solid materials\nlike masonry, stone, or marble, which cannot be resonant, then the\nprinciples of the \"echea\" must be applied.\n8. If, however, it is asked in what theatre these vessels have been\nemployed, we cannot point to any in Rome itself, but only to those in\nthe districts of Italy and in a good many Greek states. We have also the\nevidence of Lucius Mummius, who, after destroying the theatre in\nCorinth, brought its bronze vessels to Rome, and made a dedicatory\noffering at the temple of Luna with the money obtained from the sale of\nthem. Besides, many skilful architects, in constructing theatres in\nsmall towns, have, for lack of means, taken large jars made of clay, but\nsimilarly resonant, and have produced very advantageous results by\narranging them on the principles described.\nCHAPTER VI\nPLAN OF THE THEATRE\n1. The plan of the theatre itself is to be constructed as follows.\nHaving fixed upon the principal centre, draw a line of circumference\nequivalent to what is to be the perimeter at the bottom, and in it\ninscribe four equilateral triangles, at equal distances apart and\ntouching the boundary line of the circle, as the astrologers do in a\nfigure of the twelve signs of the zodiac, when they are making\ncomputations from the musical harmony of the stars. Taking that one of\nthese triangles whose side is nearest to the scaena, let the front of\nthe scaena be determined by the line where that side cuts off a segment\nof the circle (A-B), and draw, through the centre, a parallel line (C-D)\nset off from that position, to separate the platform of the stage from\nthe space of the orchestra.\n2. The platform has to be made deeper than that of the Greeks, because\nall our artists perform on the stage, while the orchestra contains the\nplaces reserved for the seats of senators. The height of this platform\nmust be not more than five feet, in order that those who sit in the\norchestra may be able to see the performances of all the actors. The\nsections (cunei) for spectators in the theatre should be so divided,\nthat the angles of the triangles which run about the circumference of\nthe circle may give the direction for the flights of steps between the\nsections, as far as up to the first curved cross-aisle. Above this, the\nupper sections are to be laid out, midway between (the lower sections),\nwith alternating passage-ways.\n3. The angles at the bottom, which give the directions for the flights\nof steps, will be seven in number (C, E, F, G, H, I, D); the other five\nangles will determine the arrangement of the scene: thus, the angle in\nthe middle ought to have the \"royal door\" (K) opposite to it; the angles\nto the right and left (L, M) will designate the position of the doors\nfor guest chambers; and the two outermost angles (A, B) will point to\nthe passages in the wings. The steps for the spectators' places, where\nthe seats are arranged, should be not less than a foot and a palm in\nheight, nor more than a foot and six fingers; their depth should be\nfixed at not more than two and a half feet, nor less than two feet.\n[Illustration: THE ROMAN THEATRE ACCORDING TO VITRUVIUS]\n4. The roof of the colonnade to be built at the top of the rows of\nseats, should lie level with the top of the \"scaena,\" for the reason\nthat the voice will then rise with equal power until it reaches the\nhighest rows of seats and the roof. If the roof is not so high, in\nproportion as it is lower, it will check the voice at the point which\nthe sound first reaches.\n5. Take one sixth of the diameter of the orchestra between the lowest\nsteps, and let the lower seats at the ends on both sides be cut away to\na height of that dimension so as to leave entrances (O, P). At the point\nwhere this cutting away occurs, fix the soffits of the passages. Thus\ntheir vaulting will be sufficiently high.\n6. The length of the \"scaena\" ought to be double the diameter of the\norchestra. The height of the podium, starting from the level of the\nstage, is, including the corona and cymatium, one twelfth of the\ndiameter of the orchestra. Above the podium, the columns, including\ntheir capitals and bases, should have a height of one quarter of the\nsame diameter, and the architraves and ornaments of the columns should\nbe one fifth of their height. The parapet above, including its cyma and\ncorona, is one half the height of the parapet below. Let the columns\nabove this parapet be one fourth less in height than the columns below,\nand the architraves and ornaments of these columns one fifth of their\nheight. If the \"scaena\" is to have three stories, let the uppermost\nparapet be half the height of the intermediate one, the columns at the\ntop one fourth less high than the intermediate, and the architraves and\ncoronae of these columns one fifth of their height as before.\n[Illustration: _From Durm_\nTHE THEATRE AT ASPENDUS]\n7. It is not possible, however, that in all theatres these rules of\nsymmetry should answer all conditions and purposes, but the architect\nought to consider to what extent he must follow the principle of\nsymmetry, and to what extent it may be modified to suit the nature of\nthe site or the size of the work. There are, of course, some things\nwhich, for utility's sake, must be made of the same size in a small\ntheatre, and a large one: such as the steps, curved cross-aisles, their\nparapets, the passages, stairways, stages, tribunals, and any other\nthings which occur that make it necessary to give up symmetry so as not\nto interfere with utility. Again, if in the course of the work any of\nthe material fall short, such as marble, timber, or anything else that\nis provided, it will not be amiss to make a slight reduction or\naddition, provided that it is done without going too far, but with\nintelligence. This will be possible, if the architect is a man of\npractical experience and, besides, not destitute of cleverness and\nskill.\n8. The \"scaena\" itself displays the following scheme. In the centre are\ndouble doors decorated like those of a royal palace. At the right and\nleft are the doors of the guest chambers. Beyond are spaces provided for\ndecoration--places that the Greeks call [Greek: periaktoi], because in\nthese places are triangular pieces of machinery ([Greek: D, D]) which\nrevolve, each having three decorated faces. When the play is to be\nchanged, or when gods enter to the accompaniment of sudden claps of\nthunder, these may be revolved and present a face differently decorated.\nBeyond these places are the projecting wings which afford entrances to\nthe stage, one from the forum, the other from abroad.\n9. There are three kinds of scenes, one called the tragic, second, the\ncomic, third, the satyric. Their decorations are different and unlike\neach other in scheme. Tragic scenes are delineated with columns,\npediments, statues, and other objects suited to kings; comic scenes\nexhibit private dwellings, with balconies and views representing rows of\nwindows, after the manner of ordinary dwellings; satyric scenes are\ndecorated with trees, caverns, mountains, and other rustic objects\ndelineated in landscape style.\nCHAPTER VII\nGREEK THEATRES\n1. In the theatres of the Greeks, these same rules of construction are\nnot to be followed in all respects. First, in the circle at the bottom\nwhere the Roman has four triangles, the Greek has three squares with\ntheir angles touching the line of circumference. The square whose side\nis nearest to the \"scaena,\" and cuts off a segment of the circle,\ndetermines by this line the limits of the \"proscaenium\" (A, B). Parallel\nto this line and tangent to the outer circumference of the segment, a\nline is drawn which fixes the front of the \"scaena\" (C-D). Through the\ncentre of the orchestra and parallel to the direction of the\n\"proscaenium,\" a line is laid off, and centres are marked where it cuts\nthe circumference to the right and left (E, F) at the ends of the\nhalf-circle. Then, with the compasses fixed at the right, an arc is\ndescribed from the horizontal distance at the left to the left hand side\nof the \"proscaenium\" (F, G); again with the centre at the left end, an\narc is described from the horizontal distance at the right to the right\nhand side of the \"proscaenium\" (E, H).\n2. As a result of this plan with three centres, the Greeks have a\nroomier orchestra, and a \"scaena\" set further back, as well as a stage\nof less depth. They call this the [Greek: logeion], for the reason that\nthere the tragic and comic actors perform on the stage, while other\nartists give their performances in the entire orchestra; hence, from\nthis fact they are given in Greek the distinct names \"Scenic\" and\n\"Thymelic.\" The height of this \"logeum\" ought to be not less than ten\nfeet nor more than twelve. Let the ascending flights of steps between\nthe wedges of seats, as far up as the first curved cross-aisle, be laid\nout on lines directly opposite to the angles of the squares. Above the\ncross-aisle, let other flights be laid out in the middle between the\nfirst; and at the top, as often as there is a new cross-aisle, the\nnumber of flights of steps is always increased to the same extent.\n[Illustration: THE GREEK THEATRE ACCORDING TO VITRUVIUS]\nCHAPTER VIII\nACOUSTICS OF THE SITE OF A THEATRE\n1. All this having been settled with the greatest pains and skill, we\nmust see to it, with still greater care, that a site has been selected\nwhere the voice has a gentle fall, and is not driven back with a recoil\nso as to convey an indistinct meaning to the ear. There are some places\nwhich from their very nature interfere with the course of the voice, as\nfor instance the dissonant, which are termed in Greek [Greek:\nkat\u00eachountes]; the circumsonant, which with them are named [Greek:\nperi\u00eachountes]; again the resonant, which are termed [Greek:\nant\u00eachountes]; and the consonant, which they call [Greek: syn\u00eachountes].\nThe dissonant are those places in which the first sound uttered that is\ncarried up high, strikes against solid bodies above, and, being driven\nback, checks as it sinks to the bottom the rise of the succeeding sound.\n2. The circumsonant are those in which the voice spreads all round, and\nthen is forced into the middle, where it dissolves, the case-endings are\nnot heard, and it dies away there in sounds of indistinct meaning. The\nresonant are those in which it comes into contact with some solid\nsubstance and recoils, thus producing an echo, and making the\nterminations of cases sound double. The consonant are those in which it\nis supported from below, increases as it goes up, and reaches the ears\nin words which are distinct and clear in tone. Hence, if there has been\ncareful attention in the selection of the site, the effect of the voice\nwill, through this precaution, be perfectly suited to the purposes of a\ntheatre.\nThe drawings of the plans may be distinguished from each other by this\ndifference, that theatres designed from squares are meant to be used by\nGreeks, while Roman theatres are designed from equilateral triangles.\nWhoever is willing to follow these directions will be able to construct\nperfectly correct theatres.\nCHAPTER IX\nCOLONNADES AND WALKS\n1. Colonnades must be constructed behind the scaena, so that when sudden\nshowers interrupt plays, the people may have somewhere to retire from\nthe theatre, and so that there may be room for the preparation of all\nthe outfit of the stage. Such places, for instance, are the colonnades\nof Pompey, and also, in Athens, the colonnades of Eumenes and the fane\nof Father Bacchus; also, as you leave the theatre, the music hall which\nThemistocles surrounded with stone columns, and roofed with the yards\nand masts of ships captured from the Persians. It was burned during the\nwar with Mithridates, and afterwards restored by King Ariobarzanes. At\nSmyrna there is the Stratoniceum, at Tralles, a colonnade on each side\nof the scaena above the race course, and in other cities which have had\ncareful architects there are colonnades and walks about the theatres.\n2. The approved way of building them requires that they should be\ndouble, and have Doric columns on the outside, with the architraves and\ntheir ornaments finished according to the law of modular proportion. The\napproved depth for them requires that the depth, from the lower part of\nthe outermost columns to the columns in the middle, and from the middle\ncolumns to the wall enclosing the walk under the colonnade, should be\nequal to the height of the outer columns. Let the middle columns be one\nfifth higher than the outer columns, and designed in the Ionic or\nCorinthian style.\n3. The columns will not be subject to the same rules of symmetry and\nproportion which I prescribed in the case of sanctuaries; for the\ndignity which ought to be their quality in temples of the gods is one\nthing, but their elegance in colonnades and other public works is quite\nanother. Hence, if the columns are to be of the Doric order, let their\nheight, including the capital, be measured off into fifteen parts. Of\nthese parts, let one be fixed upon to form the module, and in\naccordance with this module the whole work is to be developed. Let the\nthickness of the columns at the bottom be two modules; an\nintercolumniation, five and a half modules; the height of a column,\nexcluding the capital, fourteen modules; the capital, one module in\nheight and two and one sixth modules in breadth. Let the modular\nproportions of the rest of the work be carried out as written in the\nfourth book in the case of temples.\n4. But if the columns are to be Ionic, let the shaft, excluding base and\ncapital, be divided into eight and one half parts, and let one of these\nbe assigned to the thickness of a column. Let the base, including the\nplinth, be fixed at half the thickness, and let the proportions of the\ncapital be as shown in the third book. If the column is to be\nCorinthian, let its shaft and base be proportioned as in the Ionic, but\nits capital, as has been written in the fourth book. In the stylobates,\nlet the increase made there by means of the \"scamilli impares\" be taken\nfrom the description written above in the third book. Let the\narchitraves, coronae, and all the rest be developed, in proportion to\nthe columns, from what has been written in the foregoing books.\n5. The space in the middle, between the colonnades and open to the sky,\nought to be embellished with green things; for walking in the open air\nis very healthy, particularly for the eyes, since the refined and\nrarefied air that comes from green things, finding its way in because of\nthe physical exercise, gives a clean-cut image, and, by clearing away\nthe gross humours from the eyes, leaves the sight keen and the image\ndistinct. Besides, as the body gets warm with exercise in walking, this\nair, by sucking out the humours from the frame, diminishes their\nsuperabundance, and disperses and thus reduces that superfluity which is\nmore than the body can bear.\n6. That this is so may be seen from the fact that misty vapours never\narise from springs of water which are under cover, nor even from watery\nmarshes which are underground; but in uncovered places which are open to\nthe sky, when the rising sun begins to act upon the world with its\nheat, it brings out the vapour from damp and watery spots, and rolls it\nin masses upwards. Therefore, if it appears that in places open to the\nsky the more noxious humours are sucked out of the body by the air, as\nthey obviously are from the earth in the form of mists, I think there is\nno doubt that cities should be provided with the roomiest and most\nornamented walks, laid out under the free and open sky.\n7. That they may be always dry and not muddy, the following is to be\ndone. Let them be dug down and cleared out to the lowest possible depth.\nAt the right and left construct covered drains, and in their walls,\nwhich are directed towards the walks, lay earthen pipes with their lower\nends inclined into the drains. Having finished these, fill up the place\nwith charcoal, and then strew sand over the walks and level them off.\nHence, on account of the porous nature of the charcoal and the insertion\nof the pipes into the drains, quantities of water will be conducted\naway, and the walks will thus be rendered perfectly dry and without\nmoisture.\n8. Furthermore, our ancestors in establishing these works provided\ncities with storehouses for an indispensable material. The fact is that\nin sieges everything else is easier to procure than is wood. Salt can\neasily be brought in beforehand; corn can be got together quickly by the\nState or by individuals, and if it gives out, the defence may be\nmaintained on cabbage, meat, or beans; water can be had by digging\nwells, or when there are sudden falls of rain, by collecting it from the\ntiles. But a stock of wood, which is absolutely necessary for cooking\nfood, is a difficult and troublesome thing to provide; for it is slow to\ngather and a good deal is consumed.\n9. On such occasions, therefore, these walks are thrown open, and a\ndefinite allowance granted to each inhabitant according to tribes. Thus\nthese uncovered walks insure two excellent things: first, health in time\nof peace; secondly, safety in time of war. Hence, walks that are\ndeveloped on these principles, and built not only behind the \"scaena\"\nof theatres, but also at the temples of all the gods, will be capable of\nbeing of great use to cities.\n[Illustration: _Photo. Brooklyn Institute_\nTHE TEPIDARIUM OF THE STABIAN BATHS AT POMPEII]\n[Illustration: _Photo. Brooklyn Institute_\nAPODYTERIUM FOR WOMEN IN THE STABIAN BATHS AT POMPEII]\nAs it appears that we have given an adequate account of them, next will\nfollow descriptions of the arrangements of baths.\nCHAPTER X\nBATHS\n1. In the first place, the warmest possible situation must be selected;\nthat is, one which faces away from the north and northeast. The rooms\nfor the hot and tepid baths should be lighted from the southwest, or, if\nthe nature of the situation prevents this, at all events from the south,\nbecause the set time for bathing is principally from midday to evening.\nWe must also see to it that the hot bath rooms in the women's and men's\ndepartments adjoin each other, and are situated in the same quarter; for\nthus it will be possible that the same furnace should serve both of them\nand their fittings. Three bronze cauldrons are to be set over the\nfurnace, one for hot, another for tepid, and the third for cold water,\nplaced in such positions that the amount of water which flows out of the\nhot water cauldron may be replaced from that for tepid water, and in the\nsame way the cauldron for tepid water may be supplied from that for\ncold. The arrangement must allow the semi-cylinders for the bath basins\nto be heated from the same furnace.\n2. The hanging floors of the hot bath rooms are to be constructed as\nfollows. First the surface of the ground should be laid with tiles a\nfoot and a half square, sloping towards the furnace in such a way that,\nif a ball is thrown in, it cannot stop inside but must return of itself\nto the furnace room; thus the heat of the fire will more readily spread\nunder the hanging flooring. Upon them, pillars made of eight-inch bricks\nare built, and set at such a distance apart that two-foot tiles may be\nused to cover them. These pillars should be two feet in height, laid\nwith clay mixed with hair, and covered on top with the two-foot tiles\nwhich support the floor.\n[Illustration: The Stabian Baths at Pompeii\nS, S. Shops. B. Private Baths. A-T. Men's Bath. A'-T'. Women's Baths. E,\nE'. Entrances. A, A'. Apodyteria. F. Frigidarium. T, T'. Tepidarium. C,\nC. Caldarium. K, K, K. Kettles in furnace room. P. Piscina.]\n3. The vaulted ceilings will be more serviceable if built of masonry;\nbut if they are of framework, they should have tile work on the under\nside, to be constructed as follows. Let iron bars or arcs be made, and\nhang them to the framework by means of iron hooks set as close together\nas possible; and let these bars or arcs be placed at such distances\napart that each pair of them may support and carry an unflanged tile.\nThus the entire vaulting will be completely supported on iron. These\nvaults should have the joints on their upper side daubed with clay mixed\nwith hair, and their under side, facing the floor, should first be\nplastered with pounded tile mixed with lime, and then covered with\npolished stucco in relief or smooth. Vaults in hot bath rooms will be\nmore serviceable if they are doubled; for then the moisture from the\nheat will not be able to spoil the timber in the framework, but will\nmerely circulate between the two vaults.\n4. The size of the baths must depend upon the number of the population.\nThe rooms should be thus proportioned: let their breadth be one third of\ntheir length, excluding the niches for the washbowl and the bath basin.\nThe washbowl ought without fail to be placed under a window, so that the\nshadows of those who stand round it may not obstruct the light. Niches\nfor washbowls must be made so roomy that when the first comers have\ntaken their places, the others who are waiting round may have proper\nstanding room. The bath basin should be not less than six feet broad\nfrom the wall to the edge, the lower step and the \"cushion\" taking up\ntwo feet of this space.\n5. The Laconicum and other sweating baths must adjoin the tepid room,\nand their height to the bottom of the curved dome should be equal to\ntheir width. Let an aperture be left in the middle of the dome with a\nbronze disc hanging from it by chains. By raising and lowering it, the\ntemperature of the sweating bath can be regulated. The chamber itself\nought, as it seems, to be circular, so that the force of the fire and\nheat may spread evenly from the centre all round the circumference.\nCHAPTER XI\nTHE PALAESTRA\n1. Next, although the building of palaestrae is not usual in Italy, I\nthink it best to set forth the traditional way, and to show how they are\nconstructed among the Greeks. The square or oblong peristyle in a\npalaestra should be so formed that the circuit of it makes a walk of two\nstadia, a distance which the Greeks call the [Greek: diaulos]. Let three\nof its colonnades be single, but let the fourth, which is on the south\nside, be double, so that when there is bad weather accompanied by wind,\nthe drops of rain may not be able to reach the interior.\n2. In the three colonnades construct roomy recesses (A) with seats in\nthem, where philosophers, rhetoricians, and others who delight in\nlearning may sit and converse. In the double colonnade let the rooms be\narranged thus: the young men's hall (B) in the middle; this is a very\nspacious recess (exedra) with seats in it, and it should be one third\nlonger than it is broad. At the right, the bag room (C); then next, the\ndust room (D); beyond the dust room, at the corner of the colonnade, the\ncold washing room (E), which the Greeks call [Greek: loutron]. At the\nleft of the young men's hall is the anointing room (F); then, next to\nthe anointing room, the cold bath room (G), and beyond that a passage\ninto the furnace room (H) at the corner of the colonnade. Next, but\ninside and on a line with the cold bath room, put the vaulted sweating\nbath (I), its length twice its breadth, and having at the ends on one\nside a Laconicum (K), proportioned in the same manner as above\ndescribed, and opposite the Laconicum the warm washing room (L). Inside\na palaestra, the peristyle ought to be laid out as described above.\n3. But on the outside, let three colonnades be arranged, one as you\nleave the peristyle and two at the right and left, with running-tracks\nin them. That one of them which faces the north should be a double\ncolonnade of very ample breadth, while the other should be single, and\nso constructed that on the sides next the walls and the side along the\ncolumns it may have edges, serving as paths, of not less than ten feet,\nwith the space between them sunken, so that steps are necessary in going\ndown from the edges a foot and a half to the plane, which plane should\nbe not less than twelve feet wide. Thus people walking round on the\nedges will not be interfered with by the anointed who are exercising.\n[Illustration: I. THE PALAESTRA AT OLYMPIA; II. THE GREEK PALAESTRA\nACCORDING TO VITRUVIUS]\n4. This kind of colonnade is called among the Greeks [Greek: xystos],\nbecause athletes during the winter season exercise in covered running\ntracks. Next to this \"xystus\" and to the double colonnade should be laid\nout the uncovered walks which the Greeks term [Greek: paradromides] and\nour people \"xysta,\" into which, in fair weather during the winter, the\nathletes come out from the \"xystus\" for exercise. The \"xysta\" ought to\nbe so constructed that there may be plantations between the two\ncolonnades, or groves of plane trees, with walks laid out in them among\nthe trees and resting places there, made of \"opus signinum.\" Behind the\n\"xystus\" a stadium, so designed that great numbers of people may have\nplenty of room to look on at the contests between the athletes.\nI have now described all that seemed necessary for the proper\narrangement of things within the city walls.\nCHAPTER XII\nHARBOURS, BREAKWATERS, AND SHIPYARDS\n1. The subject of the usefulness of harbours is one which I must not\nomit, but must explain by what means ships are sheltered in them from\nstorms. If their situation has natural advantages, with projecting capes\nor promontories which curve or return inwards by their natural\nconformation, such harbours are obviously of the greatest service. Round\nthem, of course, colonnades or shipyards must be built, or passages from\nthe colonnades to the business quarters, and towers must be set up on\nboth sides, from which chains can be drawn across by machinery.\n2. But if we have a situation without natural advantages, and unfit to\nshelter ships from storms, it is obvious that we must proceed as\nfollows. If there is no river in the neighbourhood, but if there can be\na roadstead on one side, then, let the advances be made from the other\nside by means of walls or embankments, and let the enclosing harbour be\nthus formed. Walls which are to be under water should be constructed as\nfollows. Take the powder which comes from the country extending from\nCumae to the promontory of Minerva, and mix it in the mortar trough in\nthe proportion of two to one.\n3. Then, in the place previously determined, a cofferdam, with its sides\nformed of oaken stakes with ties between them, is to be driven down into\nthe water and firmly propped there; then, the lower surface inside,\nunder the water, must be levelled off and dredged, working from beams\nlaid across; and finally, concrete from the mortar trough--the stuff\nhaving been mixed as prescribed above--must be heaped up until the empty\nspace which was within the cofferdam is filled up by the wall. This,\nhowever, is possessed as a gift of nature by such places as have been\ndescribed above.\nBut if by reason of currents or the assaults of the open sea the props\ncannot hold the cofferdam together, then, let a platform of the greatest\npossible strength be constructed, beginning on the ground itself or on a\nsubstructure; and let the platform be constructed with a level surface\nfor less than half its extent, while the rest, which is close to the\nbeach, slopes down and out.\n4. Then, on the water's edge and at the sides of the platform, let\nmarginal walls be constructed, about one and one half feet thick and\nbrought up to a level with the surface above mentioned; next, let the\nsloping part be filled in with sand and levelled off with the marginal\nwall and the surface of the platform. Then, upon this level surface\nconstruct a block as large as is required, and when it is finished,\nleave it for not less than two months to dry. Then, cut away the\nmarginal wall which supports the sand. Thus, the sand will be undermined\nby the waves, and this will cause the block to fall into the sea. By\nthis method, repeated as often as necessary, an advance into the water\ncan be made.\n5. But in places where this powder is not found, the following method\nmust be employed. A cofferdam with double sides, composed of charred\nstakes fastened together with ties, should be constructed in the\nappointed place, and clay in wicker baskets made of swamp rushes should\nbe packed in among the props. After this has been well packed down and\nfilled in as closely as possible, set up your water-screws, wheels, and\ndrums, and let the space now bounded by the enclosure be emptied and\ndried. Then, dig out the bottom within the enclosure. If it proves to be\nof earth, it must be cleared out and dried till you come to solid bottom\nand for a space wider than the wall which is to be built upon it, and\nthen filled in with masonry consisting of rubble, lime, and sand.\n6. But if the place proves to be soft, the bottom must be staked with\npiles made of charred alder or olive wood, and then filled in with\ncharcoal as has been prescribed in the case of the foundations of\ntheatres and the city wall. Finally, build the wall of dimension stone,\nwith the bond stones as long as possible, so that particularly the\nstones in the middle may be held together by the joints. Then, fill the\ninside of the wall with broken stone or masonry. It will thus be\npossible for even a tower to be built upon it.\n7. When all this is finished, the general rule for shipyards will be to\nbuild them facing the north. Southern exposures from their heat produce\nrot, the wood worm, shipworms, and all sorts of other destructive\ncreatures, and strengthen and keep them alive. And these buildings must\nby no means be constructed of wood, for fear of fire. As for their size,\nno definite limit need be set, but they must be built to suit the\nlargest type of ship, so that if even larger ships are hauled up, they\nmay find plenty of room there.\nI have described in this book the construction and completion of all\nthat I could remember as necessary for general use in the public places\nof cities. In the following book I shall consider private houses, their\nconveniences, and symmetrical proportions.\nBOOK VI\nINTRODUCTION\n1. It is related of the Socratic philosopher Aristippus that, being\nshipwrecked and cast ashore on the coast of the Rhodians, he observed\ngeometrical figures drawn thereon, and cried out to his companions: \"Let\nus be of good cheer, for I see the traces of man.\" With that he made for\nthe city of Rhodes, and went straight to the gymnasium. There he fell to\ndiscussing philosophical subjects, and presents were bestowed upon him,\nso that he could not only fit himself out, but could also provide those\nwho accompanied him with clothing and all other necessaries of life.\nWhen his companions wished to return to their country, and asked him\nwhat message he wished them to carry home, he bade them say this: that\nchildren ought to be provided with property and resources of a kind that\ncould swim with them even out of a shipwreck.\n2. These are indeed the true supports of life, and neither Fortune's\nadverse gale, nor political revolution, nor ravages of war can do them\nany harm. Developing the same idea, Theophrastus, urging men to acquire\nlearning rather than to put their trust in money, states the case thus:\n\"The man of learning is the only person in the world who is neither a\nstranger when in a foreign land, nor friendless when he has lost his\nintimates and relatives; on the contrary, he is a citizen of every\ncountry, and can fearlessly look down upon the troublesome accidents of\nfortune. But he who thinks himself entrenched in defences not of\nlearning but of luck, moves in slippery paths, struggling through life\nunsteadily and insecurely.\"\n3. And Epicurus, in much the same way, says that the wise owe little to\nfortune; all that is greatest and essential is under the direction of\nthe thinking power of the mind and the understanding. Many other\nphilosophers have said the same thing. Likewise the poets who wrote the\nancient comedies in Greek have expressed the same sentiments in their\nverses on the stage: for example, Eucrates, Chionides, Aristophanes, and\nwith them Alexis in particular, who says that the Athenians ought to be\npraised for the reason that, while the laws of all Greeks require the\nmaintenance of parents by their children, the laws of the Athenians\nrequire this only in the case of those who have educated their children\nin the arts. All the gifts which fortune bestows she can easily take\naway; but education, when combined with intelligence, never fails, but\nabides steadily on to the very end of life.\n4. Hence, I am very much obliged and infinitely grateful to my parents\nfor their approval of this Athenian law, and for having taken care that\nI should be taught an art, and that of a sort which cannot be brought to\nperfection without learning and a liberal education in all branches of\ninstruction. Thanks, therefore, to the attention of my parents and the\ninstruction given by my teachers, I obtained a wide range of knowledge,\nand by the pleasure which I take in literary and artistic subjects, and\nin the writing of treatises, I have acquired intellectual possessions\nwhose chief fruits are these thoughts: that superfluity is useless, and\nthat not to feel the want of anything is true riches. There may be some\npeople, however, who deem all this of no consequence, and think that the\nwise are those who have plenty of money. Hence it is that very many, in\npursuit of that end, take upon themselves impudent assurance, and attain\nnotoriety and wealth at the same time.\n5. But for my part, Caesar, I have never been eager to make money by my\nart, but have gone on the principle that slender means and a good\nreputation are preferable to wealth and disrepute. For this reason, only\na little celebrity has followed; but still, my hope is that, with the\npublication of these books, I shall become known even to posterity. And\nit is not to be wondered at that I am so generally unknown. Other\narchitects go about and ask for opportunities to practise their\nprofession; but I have been taught by my instructors that it is the\nproper thing to undertake a charge only after being asked, and not to\nask for it; since a gentleman will blush with shame at petitioning for\na thing that arouses suspicion. It is in fact those who can grant\nfavours that are courted, not those who receive them. What are we to\nthink must be the suspicions of a man who is asked to allow his private\nmeans to be expended in order to please a petitioner? Must he not\nbelieve that the thing is to be done for the profit and advantage of\nthat individual?\n6. Hence it was that the ancients used to entrust their work in the\nfirst place to architects of good family, and next inquired whether they\nhad been properly educated, believing that one ought to trust in the\nhonour of a gentleman rather than in the assurance of impudence. And the\narchitects themselves would teach none but their own sons or kinsmen,\nand trained them to be good men, who could be trusted without hesitation\nin matters of such importance.\nBut when I see that this grand art is boldly professed by the uneducated\nand the unskilful, and by men who, far from being acquainted with\narchitecture, have no knowledge even of the carpenter's trade, I can\nfind nothing but praise for those householders who, in the confidence of\nlearning, are emboldened to build for themselves. Their judgment is\nthat, if they must trust to inexperienced persons, it is more becoming\nto them to use up a good round sum at their own pleasure than at that of\na stranger.\n7. Nobody, therefore, attempts to practise any other art in his own\nhome--as, for instance, the shoemaker's, or the fuller's, or any other\nof the easier kinds--but only architecture, and this is because the\nprofessionals do not possess the genuine art but term themselves\narchitects falsely. For these reasons I have thought proper to compose\nmost carefully a complete treatise on architecture and its principles,\nbelieving that it will be no unacceptable gift to all the world. In the\nfifth book I have said what I had to say about the convenient\narrangement of public works; in this I shall set forth the theoretical\nprinciples and the symmetrical proportions of private houses.\nCHAPTER I\nON CLIMATE AS DETERMINING THE STYLE OF THE HOUSE\n1. If our designs for private houses are to be correct, we must at the\noutset take note of the countries and climates in which they are built.\nOne style of house seems appropriate to build in Egypt, another in\nSpain, a different kind in Pontus, one still different in Rome, and so\non with lands and countries of other characteristics. This is because\none part of the earth is directly under the sun's course, another is far\naway from it, while another lies midway between these two. Hence, as the\nposition of the heaven with regard to a given tract on the earth leads\nnaturally to different characteristics, owing to the inclination of the\ncircle of the zodiac and the course of the sun, it is obvious that\ndesigns for houses ought similarly to conform to the nature of the\ncountry and to diversities of climate.\n2. In the north, houses should be entirely roofed over and sheltered as\nmuch as possible, not in the open, though having a warm exposure. But on\nthe other hand, where the force of the sun is great in the southern\ncountries that suffer from heat, houses must be built more in the open\nand with a northern or north-eastern exposure. Thus we may amend by art\nwhat nature, if left to herself, would mar. In other situations, also,\nwe must make modifications to correspond to the position of the heaven\nand its effects on climate.\n3. These effects are noticeable and discernible not only in things in\nnature, but they also are observable in the limbs and bodies of entire\nraces. In places on which the sun throws out its heat in moderation, it\nkeeps human bodies in their proper condition, and where its path is very\nclose at hand, it parches them up, and burns out and takes away the\nproportion of moisture which they ought to possess. But, on the other\nhand, in the cold regions that are far away from the south, the\nmoisture is not drawn out by hot weather, but the atmosphere is full of\ndampness which diffuses moisture into the system, and makes the frame\nlarger and the pitch of the voice deeper. This is also the reason why\nthe races that are bred in the north are of vast height, and have fair\ncomplexions, straight red hair, grey eyes, and a great deal of blood,\nowing to the abundance of moisture and the coolness of the atmosphere.\n4. On the contrary, those that are nearest to the southern half of the\naxis, and that lie directly under the sun's course, are of lower\nstature, with a swarthy complexion, hair curling, black eyes, strong\nlegs, and but little blood on account of the force of the sun. Hence,\ntoo, this poverty of blood makes them over-timid to stand up against the\nsword, but great heat and fevers they can endure without timidity,\nbecause their frames are bred up in the raging heat. Hence, men that are\nborn in the north are rendered over-timid and weak by fever, but their\nwealth of blood enables them to stand up against the sword without\ntimidity.\n[Illustration]\n5. The pitch of the voice is likewise different and varying in quality\nwith different nations, for the following reasons. The terminating\npoints east and west on the level of the earth, where the upper and\nlower parts of the heaven are divided, seem to lie in a naturally\nbalanced circle which mathematicians call the Horizon. Keeping this idea\ndefinitely in mind, if we imagine a line drawn from the northern side of\nthe circumference (N) to the side which lies above the southern half of\nthe axis (S), and from here another line obliquely up to the pivot at\nthe summit, beyond the stars composing the Great Bear (the pole star P),\nwe shall doubtless see that we have in the heaven a triangular figure\nlike that of the musical instrument which the Greeks call the\n\"sambuca.\"\n6. And so, under the space which is nearest to the pivot at the bottom,\noff the southern portions of the line of the axis, are found nations\nthat on account of the slight altitude of the heaven above them, have\nshrill and very high-pitched voices, like the string nearest to the\nangle in the musical instrument. Next in order come other nations as far\nas the middle of Greece, with lower elevations of the voice; and from\nthis middle point they go on in regular order up to the extreme north,\nwhere, under high altitudes, the vocal utterance of the inhabitants is,\nunder natural laws, produced in heavier tones. Thus it is obvious that\nthe system of the universe as a whole is, on account of the inclination\nof the heaven, composed in a most perfect harmony through the temporary\npower of the sun.\n7. The nations, therefore, that lie midway between the pivots at the\nsouthern and the northern extremities of the axis, converse in a voice\nof middle pitch, like the notes in the middle of a musical scale; but,\nas we proceed towards the north, the distances to the heaven become\ngreater, and so the nations there, whose vocal utterance is reduced by\nthe moisture to the \"hypat\u00e8s\" and to \"proslambanomenon,\" are naturally\nobliged to speak in heavier tones. In the same way, as we proceed from\nthe middle point to the south, the voices of the nations there\ncorrespond in extreme height of pitch and in shrillness to the\n\"paranet\u00e8s\" and \"net\u00e8s.\"\n8. That it is a fact that things are made heavier from being in places\nnaturally moist, and higher pitched from places that are hot, may be\nproved from the following experiment. Take two cups which have been\nbaked in the same oven for an equal time, which are of equal weight, and\nwhich give the same note when struck. Dip one of them into water and,\nafter taking it out of water, strike them both. This done, there will be\na great difference in their notes, and the cups can no longer be equal\nin weight. Thus it is with men: though born in the same general form and\nunder the same all-embracing heaven, yet in some of them, on account of\nthe heat in their country, the voice strikes the air on a high note,\nwhile in others, on account of abundance of moisture, the quality of\ntones produced is very heavy.\n9. Further, it is owing to the rarity of the atmosphere that southern\nnations, with their keen intelligence due to the heat, are very free and\nswift in the devising of schemes, while northern nations, being\nenveloped in a dense atmosphere, and chilled by moisture from the\nobstructing air, have but a sluggish intelligence. That this is so, we\nmay see from the case of snakes. Their movements are most active in hot\nweather, when they have got rid of the chill due to moisture, whereas at\nthe winter solstice, and in winter weather, they are chilled by the\nchange of temperature, and rendered torpid and motionless. It is\ntherefore no wonder that man's intelligence is made keener by warm air\nand duller by cold.\n10. But although southern nations have the keenest wits, and are\ninfinitely clever in forming schemes, yet the moment it comes to\ndisplaying valour, they succumb because all manliness of spirit is\nsucked out of them by the sun. On the other hand, men born in cold\ncountries are indeed readier to meet the shock of arms with great\ncourage and without timidity, but their wits are so slow that they will\nrush to the charge inconsiderately and inexpertly, thus defeating their\nown devices. Such being nature's arrangement of the universe, and all\nthese nations being allotted temperaments which are lacking in due\nmoderation, the truly perfect territory, situated under the middle of\nthe heaven, and having on each side the entire extent of the world and\nits countries, is that which is occupied by the Roman people.\n11. In fact, the races of Italy are the most perfectly constituted in\nboth respects--in bodily form and in mental activity to correspond to\ntheir valour. Exactly as the planet Jupiter is itself temperate, its\ncourse lying midway between Mars, which is very hot, and Saturn, which\nis very cold, so Italy, lying between the north and the south, is a\ncombination of what is found on each side, and her pre\u00ebminence is well\nregulated and indisputable. And so by her wisdom she breaks the\ncourageous onsets of the barbarians, and by her strength of hand\nthwarts the devices of the southerners. Hence, it was the divine\nintelligence that set the city of the Roman people in a peerless and\ntemperate country, in order that it might acquire the right to command\nthe whole world.\n12. Now if it is a fact that countries differ from one another, and are\nof various classes according to climate, so that the very nations born\ntherein naturally differ in mental and physical conformation and\nqualities, we cannot hesitate to make our houses suitable in plan to the\npeculiarities of nations and races, since we have the expert guidance of\nnature herself ready to our hand.\nI have now set forth the peculiar characteristics of localities, so far\nas I could note them, in the most summary way, and have stated how we\nought to make our houses conform to the physical qualities of nations,\nwith due regard to the course of the sun and to climate. Next I shall\ntreat the symmetrical proportions of the different styles of houses,\nboth as wholes and in their separate parts.\nCHAPTER II\nSYMMETRY, AND MODIFICATIONS IN IT TO SUIT THE SITE\n1. There is nothing to which an architect should devote more thought\nthan to the exact proportions of his building with reference to a\ncertain part selected as the standard. After the standard of symmetry\nhas been determined, and the proportionate dimensions adjusted by\ncalculations, it is next the part of wisdom to consider the nature of\nthe site, or questions of use or beauty, and modify the plan by\ndiminutions or additions in such a manner that these diminutions or\nadditions in the symmetrical relations may be seen to be made on correct\nprinciples, and without detracting at all from the effect.\n2. The look of a building when seen close at hand is one thing, on a\nheight it is another, not the same in an enclosed place, still\ndifferent in the open, and in all these cases it takes much judgment to\ndecide what is to be done. The fact is that the eye does not always give\na true impression, but very often leads the mind to form a false\njudgment. In painted scenery, for example, columns may appear to jut\nout, mutules to project, and statues to be standing in the foreground,\nalthough the picture is of course perfectly flat. Similarly with ships,\nthe oars when under the water are straight, though to the eye they\nappear to be broken. To the point where they touch the surface of the\nsea they look straight, as indeed they are, but when dipped under the\nwater they emit from their bodies undulating images which come swimming\nup through the naturally transparent medium to the surface of the water,\nand, being there thrown into commotion, make the oars look broken.\n3. Now whether this appearance is due to the impact of the images, or to\nthe effusion of the rays from the eye, as the physicists hold, in either\ncase it is obvious that the vision may lead us to false impressions.\n4. Since, therefore, the reality may have a false appearance, and since\nthings are sometimes represented by the eyes as other than they are, I\nthink it certain that diminutions or additions should be made to suit\nthe nature or needs of the site, but in such fashion that the buildings\nlose nothing thereby. These results, however, are also attainable by\nflashes of genius, and not only by mere science.\n5. Hence, the first thing to settle is the standard of symmetry, from\nwhich we need not hesitate to vary. Then, lay out the ground lines of\nthe length and breadth of the work proposed, and when once we have\ndetermined its size, let the construction follow this with due regard to\nbeauty of proportion, so that the beholder may feel no doubt of the\neurythmy of its effect. I must now tell how this may be brought about,\nand first I will speak of the proper construction of a cavaedium.\nCHAPTER III\nPROPORTIONS OF THE PRINCIPAL ROOMS\n1. There are five different styles of cavaedium, termed according to\ntheir construction as follows: Tuscan, Corinthian, tetrastyle,\ndispluviate, and testudinate.\nIn the Tuscan, the girders that cross the breadth of the atrium have\ncrossbeams on them, and valleys sloping in and running from the angles\nof the walls to the angles formed by the beams, and the rainwater falls\ndown along the rafters to the roof-opening (compluvium) in the middle.\nIn the Corinthian, the girders and roof-opening are constructed on these\nsame principles, but the girders run in from the side walls, and are\nsupported all round on columns.\nIn the tetrastyle, the girders are supported at the angles by columns,\nan arrangement which relieves and strengthens the girders; for thus they\nhave themselves no great span to support, and they are not loaded down\nby the crossbeams.\n[Illustration: _From Mau_\nTHE HOUSE OF THE SURGEON, POMPEII\nIllustrating the Tuscan Atrium\n1.

In the displuviate, there are beams which slope outwards, supporting\nthe roof and throwing the rainwater off. This style is suitable chiefly\nin winter residences, for its roof-opening, being high up, is not an\nobstruction to the light of the dining rooms. It is, however, very\ntroublesome to keep in repair, because the pipes, which are intended to\nhold the water that comes dripping down the walls all round, cannot take\nit quickly enough as it runs down from the channels, but get too full\nand run over, thus spoiling the woodwork and the walls of houses of this\nstyle.\n[Illustration: _From Mau_\nHOUSE OF THE SILVER WEDDING AT POMPEII\nIllustrating the Tetrastyle Atrium\n_a._ fauces\n_d._ tetrastyle atrium\n_n._ dining room\n_o._ tablinum\n_p._ andron\n_r._ peristyle\n_w._ summer dining room\n]\nThe testudinate is employed where the span is not great, and where large\nrooms are provided in upper stories.\n3. In width and length, atriums are designed according to three classes.\nThe first is laid out by dividing the length into five parts and giving\nthree parts to the width; the second, by dividing it into three parts\nand assigning two parts to the width; the third, by using the width to\ndescribe a square figure with equal sides, drawing a diagonal line in\nthis square, and giving the atrium the length of this diagonal line.\n4. Their height up to the girders should be one fourth less than their\nwidth, the rest being the proportion assigned to the ceiling and the\nroof above the girders.\nThe alae, to the right and left, should have a width equal to one third\nof the length of the atrium, when that is from thirty to forty feet\nlong. From forty to fifty feet, divide the length by three and one\nhalf, and give the alae the result. When it is from fifty to sixty feet\nin length, devote one fourth of the length to the alae. From sixty to\neighty feet, divide the length by four and one half and let the result\nbe the width of the alae. From eighty feet to one hundred feet, the\nlength divided into five parts will produce the right width for the\nalae. Their lintel beams should be placed high enough to make the height\nof the alae equal to their width.\n5. The tablinum should be given two thirds of the width of the atrium\nwhen the latter is twenty feet wide. If it is from thirty to forty feet,\nlet half the width of the atrium be devoted to the tablinum. When it is\nfrom forty to sixty feet, divide the width into five parts and let two\nof these be set apart for the tablinum. In the case of smaller atriums,\nthe symmetrical proportions cannot be the same as in larger. For if, in\nthe case of the smaller, we employ the proportion that belong to the\nlarger, both tablina and alae must be unserviceable, while if, in the\ncase of the larger, we employ the proportions of the smaller, the rooms\nmentioned will be huge monstrosities. Hence, I have thought it best to\ndescribe exactly their respective proportionate sizes, with a view both\nto convenience and to beauty.\n[Illustration: _From Mau_\nPLAN OF A TYPICAL ROMAN HOUSE]\n6. The height of the tablinum at the lintel should be one eighth more\nthan its width. Its ceiling should exceed this height by one third of\nthe width. The fauces in the case of smaller atriums should be two\nthirds, and in the case of larger one half the width of the tablinum.\nLet the busts of ancestors with their ornaments be set up at a height\ncorresponding to the width of the alae. The proportionate width and\nheight of doors may be settled, if they are Doric, in the Doric manner,\nand if Ionic, in the Ionic manner, according to the rules of symmetry\nwhich have been given about portals in the fourth book. In the\nroof-opening let an aperture be left with a breadth of not less than\none fourth nor more than one third the width of the atrium, and with a\nlength proportionate to that of the atrium.\n[Illustration: _Photo. Sommer_\nTHE PERISTYLE OF THE HOUSE OF THE VETTII AT POMPEII]\n7. Peristyles, lying athwart, should be one third longer than they are\ndeep, and their columns as high as the colonnades are wide.\nIntercolumniations of peristyles should be not less than three nor more\nthan four times the thickness of the columns. If the columns of the\nperistyle are to be made in the Doric style, take the modules which I\nhave given in the fourth book, on the Doric order, and arrange the\ncolumns with reference to these modules and to the scheme of the\ntriglyphs.\n[Illustration: _From Durm_\nPLAN OF THE HOUSE OF THE VETTII, POMPEII]\n8. Dining rooms ought to be twice as long as they are wide. The height\nof all oblong rooms should be calculated by adding together their\nmeasured length and width, taking one half of this total, and using the\nresult for the height. But in the case of exedrae or square oeci, let\nthe height be brought up to one and one half times the width. Picture\ngalleries, like exedrae, should be constructed of generous dimensions.\nCorinthian and tetrastyle oeci, as well as those termed Egyptian, should\nhave the same symmetrical proportions in width and length as the dining\nrooms described above, but, since they have columns in them, their\ndimensions should be ampler.\n9. The following will be the distinction between Corinthian and Egyptian\noeci: the Corinthian have single tiers of columns, set either on a\npodium or on the ground, with architraves over them and coronae either\nof woodwork or of stucco, and carved vaulted ceilings above the coronae.\nIn the Egyptian there are architraves over the columns, and joists laid\nthereon from the architraves to the surrounding walls, with a floor in\nthe upper story to allow of walking round under the open sky. Then,\nabove the architrave and perpendicularly over the lower tier of columns,\ncolumns one fourth smaller should be imposed. Above their architraves\nand ornaments are decorated ceilings, and the upper columns have windows\nset in between them. Thus the Egyptian are not like Corinthian dining\nrooms, but obviously resemble basilicas.\n10. There are also, though not customary in Italy, the oeci which the\nGreeks call Cyzicene. These are built with a northern exposure and\ngenerally command a view of gardens, and have folding doors in the\nmiddle. They are also so long and so wide that two sets of dining\ncouches, facing each other, with room to pass round them, can be placed\ntherein. On the right and left they have windows which open like folding\ndoors, so that views of the garden may be had from the dining couches\nthrough the opened windows. The height of such rooms is one and one half\ntimes their width.\n11. All the above-mentioned symmetrical relations should be observed, in\nthese kinds of buildings, that can be observed without embarrassment\ncaused by the situation. The windows will be an easy matter to arrange\nif they are not darkened by high walls; but in cases of confined space,\nor when there are other unavoidable obstructions, it will be permissible\nto make diminutions or additions in the symmetrical relations,--with\ningenuity and acuteness, however, so that the result may be not unlike\nthe beauty which is due to true symmetry.\nCHAPTER IV\nTHE PROPER EXPOSURES OF THE DIFFERENT ROOMS\n1. We shall next explain how the special purposes of different rooms\nrequire different exposures, suited to convenience and to the quarters\nof the sky. Winter dining rooms and bathrooms should have a southwestern\nexposure, for the reason that they need the evening light, and also\nbecause the setting sun, facing them in all its splendour but with\nabated heat, lends a gentler warmth to that quarter in the evening.\nBedrooms and libraries ought to have an eastern exposure, because their\npurposes require the morning light, and also because books in such\nlibraries will not decay. In libraries with southern exposures the books\nare ruined by worms and dampness, because damp winds come up, which\nbreed and nourish the worms, and destroy the books with mould, by\nspreading their damp breath over them.\n2. Dining rooms for Spring and Autumn to the east; for when the windows\nface that quarter, the sun, as he goes on his career from over against\nthem to the west, leaves such rooms at the proper temperature at the\ntime when it is customary to use them. Summer dining rooms to the north,\nbecause that quarter is not, like the others, burning with heat during\nthe solstice, for the reason that it is unexposed to the sun's course,\nand hence it always keeps cool, and makes the use of the rooms both\nhealthy and agreeable. Similarly with picture galleries, embroiderers'\nwork rooms, and painters' studios, in order that the fixed light may\npermit the colours used in their work to last with qualities unchanged.\nCHAPTER V\nHOW THE ROOMS SHOULD BE SUITED TO THE STATION OF THE OWNER\n1. After settling the positions of the rooms with regard to the quarters\nof the sky, we must next consider the principles on which should be\nconstructed those apartments in private houses which are meant for the\nhouseholders themselves, and those which are to be shared in common with\noutsiders. The private rooms are those into which nobody has the right\nto enter without an invitation, such as bedrooms, dining rooms,\nbathrooms, and all others used for the like purposes. The common are\nthose which any of the people have a perfect right to enter, even\nwithout an invitation: that is, entrance courts, cavaedia, peristyles,\nand all intended for the like purpose. Hence, men of everyday fortune do\nnot need entrance courts, tablina, or atriums built in grand style,\nbecause such men are more apt to discharge their social obligations by\ngoing round to others than to have others come to them.\n2. Those who do business in country produce must have stalls and shops\nin their entrance courts, with crypts, granaries, store-rooms, and so\nforth in their houses, constructed more for the purpose of keeping the\nproduce in good condition than for ornamental beauty.\nFor capitalists and farmers of the revenue, somewhat comfortable and\nshowy apartments must be constructed, secure against robbery; for\nadvocates and public speakers, handsomer and more roomy, to accommodate\nmeetings; for men of rank who, from holding offices and magistracies,\nhave social obligations to their fellow-citizens, lofty entrance courts\nin regal style, and most spacious atriums and peristyles, with\nplantations and walks of some extent in them, appropriate to their\ndignity. They need also libraries, picture galleries, and basilicas,\nfinished in a style similar to that of great public buildings, since\npublic councils as well as private law suits and hearings before\narbitrators are very often held in the houses of such men.\n3. If, therefore, houses are planned on these principles to suit\ndifferent classes of persons, as prescribed in my first book, under the\nsubject of Propriety, there will be no room for criticism; for they will\nbe arranged with convenience and perfection to suit every purpose. The\nrules on these points will hold not only for houses in town, but also\nfor those in the country, except that in town atriums are usually next\nto the front door, while in country seats peristyles come first, and\nthen atriums surrounded by paved colonnades opening upon palaestrae and\nwalks.\nI have now set forth the rules for houses in town so far as I could\ndescribe them in a summary way. Next I shall state how farmhouses may be\narranged with a view to convenience in use, and shall give the rules for\ntheir construction.\nCHAPTER VI\nTHE FARMHOUSE\n1. In the first place, inspect the country from the point of view of\nhealth, in accordance with what is written in my first book, on the\nbuilding of cities, and let your farmhouses be situated accordingly.\nTheir dimensions should depend upon the size of the farm and the amount\nof produce. Their courtyards and the dimensions thereof should be\ndetermined by the number of cattle and the number of yokes of oxen that\nwill need to be kept therein. Let the kitchen be placed on the warmest\nside of the courtyard, with the stalls for the oxen adjoining, and their\ncribs facing the kitchen fire and the eastern quarter of the sky, for\nthe reason that oxen facing the light and the fire do not get\nrough-coated. Even peasants wholly without knowledge of the quarters of\nthe sky believe that oxen ought to face only in the direction of the\nsunrise.\n[Illustration: _From Mau_\nTHE VILLA RUSTICA AT BOSCOREALE NEAR POMPEII\n_A._ Court. _B._ Kitchen. _C-F._ Baths. _H._ Stable.\n_J._ Toolroom. _K, L, V, V._ Bedrooms.\n_N._ Dining Room. _M._ Anteroom. _O._ Bakery.\n_P._ Room with two winepresses. _Q._ Corridor.\n_B._ Court for fermentation of wine. _S._ Barn.\n_T._ Threshing-floor. _Y._ Room with oil press.\n]\n2. Their stalls ought to be not less than ten nor more than fifteen feet\nwide, and long enough to allow not less than seven feet for each yoke.\nBathrooms, also, should adjoin the kitchen; for in this situation it\nwill not take long to get ready a bath in the country.\nLet the pressing room, also, be next to the kitchen; for in this\nsituation it will be easy to deal with the fruit of the olive. Adjoining\nit should be the wine room with its windows lighted from the north. In a\nroom with windows on any other quarter so that the sun can heat it, the\nheat will get into the wine and make it weak.\n3. The oil room must be situated so as to get its light from the south\nand from warm quarters; for oil ought not to be chilled, but should be\nkept thin by gentle heat. In dimensions, oil rooms should be built to\naccommodate the crop and the proper number of jars, each of which,\nholding about one hundred and twenty gallons, must take up a space four\nfeet in diameter. The pressing room itself, if the pressure is exerted\nby means of levers and a beam, and not worked by turning screws, should\nbe not less than forty feet long, which will give the lever man a\nconvenient amount of space. It should be not less than sixteen feet\nwide, which will give the men who are at work plenty of free space to do\nthe turning conveniently. If two presses are required in the place,\nallow twenty-four feet for the width.\n4. Folds for sheep and goats must be made large enough to allow each\nanimal a space of not less than four and a half, nor more than six feet.\nRooms for grain should be set in an elevated position and with a\nnorthern or north-eastern exposure. Thus the grain will not be able to\nheat quickly, but, being cooled by the wind, keeps a long time. Other\nexposures produce the corn weevil and the other little creatures that\nare wont to spoil the grain. To the stable should be assigned the very\nwarmest place in the farmhouse, provided that it is not exposed to the\nkitchen fire; for when draught animals are stabled very near a fire,\ntheir coats get rough.\n5. Furthermore, there are advantages in building cribs apart from the\nkitchen and in the open, facing the east; for when the oxen are taken\nover to them on early winter mornings in clear weather, their coats get\nsleeker as they take their fodder in the sunlight. Barns for grain, hay,\nand spelt, as well as bakeries, should be built apart from the\nfarmhouse, so that farmhouses may be better protected against danger\nfrom fire. If something more refined is required in farmhouses, they may\nbe constructed on the principles of symmetry which have been given above\nin the case of town houses, provided that there is nothing in such\nbuildings to interfere with their usefulness on a farm.\n6. We must take care that all buildings are well lighted, but this is\nobviously an easier matter with those which are on country estates,\nbecause there can be no neighbour's wall to interfere, whereas in town\nhigh party walls or limited space obstruct the light and make them dark.\nHence we must apply the following test in this matter. On the side from\nwhich the light should be obtained let a line be stretched from the top\nof the wall that seems to obstruct the light to the point at which it\nought to be introduced, and if a considerable space of open sky can be\nseen when one looks up above that line, there will be no obstruction to\nthe light in that situation.\n7. But if there are timbers in the way, or lintels, or upper stories,\nthen, make the opening higher up and introduce the light in this way.\nAnd as a general rule, we must arrange so as to leave places for windows\non all sides on which a clear view of the sky can be had, for this will\nmake our buildings light. Not only in dining rooms and other rooms for\ngeneral use are windows very necessary, but also in passages, level or\ninclined, and on stairs; for people carrying burdens too often meet and\nrun against each other in such places.\nI have now set forth the plans used for buildings in our native country\nso that they may be clear to builders. Next, I shall describe summarily\nhow houses are planned in the Greek fashion, so that these also may be\nunderstood.\nCHAPTER VII\nTHE GREEK HOUSE\n1. The Greeks, having no use for atriums, do not build them, but make\npassage-ways for people entering from the front door, not very wide,\nwith stables on one side and doorkeepers' rooms on the other, and shut\noff by doors at the inner end. This place between the two doors is\ntermed in Greek [Greek: thyr\u00f4reion]. From it one enters the peristyle.\nThis peristyle has colonnades on three sides, and on the side facing the\nsouth it has two antae, a considerable distance apart, carrying an\narchitrave, with a recess for a distance one third less than the space\nbetween the antae. This space is called by some writers \"prostas,\" by\nothers \"pastas.\"\n[Illustration: PLAN OF VITRUVIUS' GREEK HOUSE ACCORDING TO BECKER]\n2. Hereabouts, towards the inner side, are the large rooms in which\nmistresses of houses sit with their wool-spinners. To the right and left\nof the prostas there are chambers, one of which is called the\n\"thalamos,\" the other the \"amphithalamos.\" All round the colonnades are\ndining rooms for everyday use, chambers, and rooms for the slaves. This\npart of the house is termed \"gynaeconitis.\"\n3. In connexion with these there are ampler sets of apartments with more\nsumptuous peristyles, surrounded by four colonnades of equal height, or\nelse the one which faces the south has higher columns than the others. A\nperistyle that has one such higher colonnade is called a Rhodian\nperistyle. Such apartments have fine entrance courts with imposing front\ndoors of their own; the colonnades of the peristyles are decorated with\npolished stucco in relief and plain, and with coffered ceilings of\nwoodwork; off the colonnades that face the north they have Cyzicene\ndining rooms and picture galleries; to the east, libraries; exedrae to\nthe west; and to the south, large square rooms of such generous\ndimensions that four sets of dining couches can easily be arranged in\nthem, with plenty of room for serving and for the amusements.\n4. Men's dinner parties are held in these large rooms; for it was not\nthe practice, according to Greek custom, for the mistress of the house\nto be present. On the contrary, such peristyles are called the men's\napartments, since in them the men can stay without interruption from the\nwomen. Furthermore, small sets of apartments are built to the right and\nleft, with front doors of their own and suitable dining rooms and\nchambers, so that guests from abroad need not be shown into the\nperistyles, but rather into such guests' apartments. For when the Greeks\nbecame more luxurious, and their circumstances more opulent, they began\nto provide dining rooms, chambers, and store-rooms of provisions for\ntheir guests from abroad, and on the first day they would invite them to\ndinner, sending them on the next chickens, eggs, vegetables, fruits, and\nother country produce. This is why artists called pictures representing\nthe things which were sent to guests \"xenia.\" Thus, too, the heads of\nfamilies, while being entertained abroad, had the feeling that they were\nnot away from home, since they enjoyed privacy and freedom in such\nguests' apartments.\n[Illustration: _From Bull. de. Corr. Hell. 1895_\nGREEK HOUSE AT DELOS]\n5. Between the two peristyles and the guests' apartments are the\npassage-ways called \"mesauloe,\" because they are situated midway between\ntwo courts; but our people called them \"andrones.\"\nThis, however, is a very strange fact, for the term does not fit either\nthe Greek or the Latin use of it. The Greeks call the large rooms in\nwhich men's dinner parties are usually held [Greek: andr\u00f4nes], because\nwomen do not go there. There are other similar instances as in the case\nof \"xystus,\" \"prothyrum,\" \"telamones,\" and some others of the sort. As a\nGreek term, [Greek: xystos] means a colonnade of large dimensions in\nwhich athletes exercise in the winter time. But our people apply the\nterm \"xysta\" to uncovered walks, which the Greeks call [Greek:\nparadromides]. Again, [Greek: prothyra] means in Greek the entrance\ncourts before the front doors; we, however, use the term \"prothyra\" in\nthe sense of the Greek [Greek: diathyra].\n[Illustration: _From Mitt. d. Deutsch. Arch. Inst_.\nGREEK HOUSE DISCOVERED AT PERGAMUM IN 1903\n13. Prothyron. 7. Tablinum.]\n6. Again, figures in the form of men supporting mutules or coronae, we\nterm \"telamones\"--the reasons why or wherefore they are so called are\nnot found in any story--but the Greeks name them [Greek: atlantes]. For\nAtlas is described in story as holding up the firmament because, through\nhis vigorous intelligence and ingenuity, he was the first to cause men\nto be taught about the courses of the sun and moon, and the laws\ngoverning the revolutions of all the constellations. Consequently, in\nrecognition of this benefaction, painters and sculptors represent him\nas holding up the firmament, and the Atlantides, his daughters, whom we\ncall \"Vergiliae\" and the Greeks [Greek: Pleiades], are consecrated in\nthe firmament among the constellations.\n7. All this, however, I have not set forth for the purpose of changing\nthe usual terminology or language, but I have thought that it should be\nexplained so that it may be known to scholars.\nI have now explained the usual ways of planning houses both in the\nItalian fashion and according to the practices of the Greeks, and have\ndescribed, with regard to their symmetry, the proportions of the\ndifferent classes. Having, therefore, already written of their beauty\nand propriety, I shall next explain, with reference to durability, how\nthey may be built to last to a great age without defects.\nCHAPTER VIII\nON FOUNDATIONS AND SUBSTRUCTURES\n1. Houses which are set level with the ground will no doubt last to a\ngreat age, if their foundations are laid in the manner which we have\nexplained in the earlier books, with regard to city walls and theatres.\nBut if underground rooms and vaults are intended, their foundations\nought to be thicker than the walls which are to be constructed in the\nupper part of the house, and the walls, piers, and columns of the latter\nshould be set perpendicularly over the middle of the foundation walls\nbelow, so that they may have solid bearing; for if the load of the walls\nor columns rests on the middle of spans, they can have no permanent\ndurability.\n2. It will also do no harm to insert posts between lintels and sills\nwhere there are piers or antae; for where the lintels and beams have\nreceived the load of the walls, they may sag in the middle, and\ngradually undermine and destroy the walls. But when there are posts set\nup underneath and wedged in there, they prevent the beams from settling\nand injuring such walls.\n3. We must also manage to discharge the load of the walls by means of\narchings composed of voussoirs with joints radiating to the centre. For\nwhen arches with voussoirs are sprung from the ends of beams, or from\nthe bearings of lintels, in the first place they will discharge the load\nand the wood will not sag; secondly, if in course of time the wood\nbecomes at all defective, it can easily be replaced without the\nconstruction of shoring.\n4. Likewise in houses where piers are used in the construction, when\nthere are arches composed of voussoirs with joints radiating to the\ncentre, the outermost piers at these points must be made broader than\nthe others, so that they may have the strength to resist when the\nwedges, under the pressure of the load of the walls, begin to press\nalong their joints towards the centre, and thus to thrust out the\nabutments. Hence, if the piers at the ends are of large dimensions, they\nwill hold the voussoirs together, and make such works durable.\n5. Having taken heed in these matters to see that proper attention is\npaid to them, we must also be equally careful that all walls are\nperfectly vertical, and that they do not lean forward anywhere.\nParticular pains, too, must be taken with substructures, for here an\nendless amount of harm is usually done by the earth used as filling.\nThis cannot always remain of the same weight that it usually has in\nsummer, but in winter time it increases in weight and bulk by taking up\na great deal of rain water, and then it bursts its enclosing walls and\nthrusts them out.\n6. The following means must be taken to provide against such a defect.\nFirst, let the walls be given a thickness proportionate to the amount of\nfilling; secondly, build counterforts or buttresses at the same time as\nthe wall, on the outer side, at distances from each other equivalent to\nwhat is to be the height of the substructure and with the thickness of\nthe substructure. At the bottom let them run out to a distance\ncorresponding to the thickness that has been determined for the\nsubstructure, and then gradually diminish in extent so that at the\nsurface their projection is equal to the thickness of the wall of the\nbuilding.\n[Illustration: RETAINING WALLS\n(From the edition of Vitruvius by Fra Giocondo, Venice 1511)]\n7. Furthermore, inside, to meet the mass of earth, there should be\nsaw-shaped constructions attached to the wall, the single teeth\nextending from the wall for a distance equivalent to what is to be the\nheight of the substructure, and the teeth being constructed with the\nsame thickness as the wall. Then at the outermost angles take a distance\ninwards, from the inside of the angle, equal to the height of the\nsubstructure, and mark it off on each side; from these marks build up a\ndiagonal structure and from the middle of it a second, joined on to the\nangle of the wall. With this arrangement, the teeth and diagonal\nstructures will not allow the filling to thrust with all its force\nagainst the wall, but will check and distribute the pressure.\n8. I have now shown how buildings can be constructed without defects,\nand the way to take precautions against the occurrence of them. As for\nreplacing tiles, roof timbers, and rafters, we need not be so particular\nabout them as about the parts just mentioned, because they can easily be\nreplaced, however defective they may become. Hence, I have shown by what\nmethods the parts which are not considered solid can be rendered\ndurable, and how they are constructed.\n9. As for the kind of material to be used, this does not depend upon the\narchitect, for the reason that all kinds of materials are not found in\nall places alike, as has been shown in the first book. Besides, it\ndepends on the owner whether he desires to build in brick, or rubble\nwork, or dimension stone. Consequently the question of approving any\nwork may be considered under three heads: that is, delicacy of\nworkmanship, sumptuousness, and design. When it appears that a work has\nbeen carried out sumptuously, the owner will be the person to be praised\nfor the great outlay which he has authorized; when delicately, the\nmaster workman will be approved for his execution; but when proportions\nand symmetry lend it an imposing effect, then the glory of it will\nbelong to the architect.\n10. Such results, however, may very well be brought about when he allows\nhimself to take the advice both of workmen and of laymen. In fact, all\nkinds of men, and not merely architects, can recognize a good piece of\nwork, but between laymen and the latter there is this difference, that\nthe layman cannot tell what it is to be like without seeing it finished,\nwhereas the architect, as soon as he has formed the conception, and\nbefore he begins the work, has a definite idea of the beauty, the\nconvenience, and the propriety that will distinguish it.\nI have now described as clearly as I could what I thought necessary for\nprivate houses, and how to build them. In the following book I shall\ntreat of the kinds of polished finish employed to make them elegant, and\ndurable without defects to a great age.\nBOOK VII\nINTRODUCTION\n1. It was a wise and useful provision of the ancients to transmit their\nthoughts to posterity by recording them in treatises, so that they\nshould not be lost, but, being developed in succeeding generations\nthrough publication in books, should gradually attain in later times, to\nthe highest refinement of learning. And so the ancients deserve no\nordinary, but unending thanks, because they did not pass on in envious\nsilence, but took care that their ideas of every kind should be\ntransmitted to the future in their writings.\n2. If they had not done so, we could not have known what deeds were done\nin Troy, nor what Thales, Democritus, Anaxagoras, Xenophanes, and the\nother physicists thought about nature, and what rules Socrates, Plato,\nAristotle, Zeno, Epicurus, and other philosophers laid down for the\nconduct of human life; nor would the deeds and motives of Croesus,\nAlexander, Darius, and other kings have been known, unless the ancients\nhad compiled treatises, and published them in commentaries to be had in\nuniversal remembrance with posterity.\n3. So, while they deserve our thanks, those, on the contrary, deserve\nour reproaches, who steal the writings of such men and publish them as\ntheir own; and those also, who depend in their writings, not on their\nown ideas, but who enviously do wrong to the works of others and boast\nof it, deserve not merely to be blamed, but to be sentenced to actual\npunishment for their wicked course of life. With the ancients, however,\nit is said that such things did not pass without pretty strict\nchastisement. What the results of their judgments were, it may not be\nout of place to set forth as they are transmitted to us.\n4. The kings of the house of Attalus having established, under the\ninfluence of the great charms of literature, an excellent library at\nPergamus to give pleasure to the public, Ptolemy also was aroused with\nno end of enthusiasm and emulation into exertions to make a similar\nprovision with no less diligence at Alexandria. Having done so with the\ngreatest care, he felt that this was not enough without providing for\nits increase and development, for which he sowed the seed. He\nestablished public contests in honour of the Muses and Apollo, and\nappointed prizes and honours for victorious authors in general, as is\ndone in the case of athletes.\n5. These arrangements having been made, and the contests being at hand,\nit became necessary to select literary men as judges to decide them. The\nking soon selected six of the citizens, but could not so easily find a\nproper person to be the seventh. He therefore turned to those who\npresided over the library, and asked whether they knew anybody who was\nsuitable for the purpose. Then they told him that there was one\nAristophanes who was daily engaged in reading through all the books with\nthe greatest enthusiasm and the greatest care. Hence, when the gathering\nfor the contests took place, and separate seats were set apart for the\njudges, Aristophanes was summoned with the rest, and sat down in the\nplace assigned to him.\n6. A group of poets was first brought in to contend, and, as they\nrecited their compositions, the whole audience by its applause showed\nthe judges what it approved. So, when they were individually asked for\ntheir votes, the six agreed, and awarded the first prize to the poet\nwho, as they observed, had most pleased the multitude, and the second to\nthe one who came next. But Aristophanes, on being asked for his vote,\nurged that the poet who had least pleased the audience should be\ndeclared to be the first.\n7. As the king and the entire assembly showed great indignation, he\narose, and asked and received permission to speak. Silence being\nobtained, he stated that only one of them--his man--was a poet, and that\nthe rest had recited things not their own; furthermore, that judges\nought to give their approval, not to thefts, but to original\ncompositions. The people were amazed, and the king hesitated, but\nAristophanes, trusting to his memory, had a vast number of volumes\nbrought out from bookcases which he specified, and, by comparing them\nwith what had been recited, obliged the thieves themselves to make\nconfession. So, the king gave orders that they should be accused of\ntheft, and after condemnation sent them off in disgrace; but he honoured\nAristophanes with the most generous gifts, and put him in charge of the\nlibrary.\n8. Some years later, Zoilus, who took the surname of Homeromastix, came\nfrom Macedonia to Alexandria and read to the king his writings directed\nagainst the Iliad and Odyssey. Ptolemy, seeing the father of poets and\ncaptain of all literature abused in his absence, and his works, to which\nall the world looked up in admiration, disparaged by this person, made\nno rejoinder, although he thought it an outrage. Zoilus, however, after\nremaining in the kingdom some time, sank into poverty, and sent a\nmessage to the king, requesting that something might be bestowed upon\nhim.\n9. But it is said that the king replied, that Homer, though dead a\nthousand years ago, had all that time been the means of livelihood for\nmany thousands of men; similarly, a person who laid claim to higher\ngenius ought to be able to support not one man only, but many others.\nAnd in short, various stories are told about his death, which was like\nthat of one found guilty of parricide. Some writers have said that he\nwas crucified by Philadelphus; others that he was stoned at Chios;\nothers again that he was thrown alive upon a funeral pyre at Smyrna.\nWhichever of these forms of death befell him, it was a fitting\npunishment and his just due; for one who accuses men that cannot answer\nand show, face to face, what was the meaning of their writings,\nobviously deserves no other treatment.\n10. But for my part, Caesar, I am not bringing forward the present\ntreatise after changing the titles of other men's books and inserting my\nown name, nor has it been my plan to win approbation by finding fault\nwith the ideas of another. On the contrary, I express unlimited thanks\nto all the authors that have in the past, by compiling from antiquity\nremarkable instances of the skill shown by genius, provided us with\nabundant materials of different kinds. Drawing from them as it were\nwater from springs, and converting them to our own purposes, we find our\npowers of writing rendered more fluent and easy, and, relying upon such\nauthorities, we venture to produce new systems of instruction.\n11. Hence, as I saw that such beginnings on their part formed an\nintroduction suited to the nature of my own purpose, I set out to draw\nfrom them, and to go somewhat further.\nIn the first place Agatharcus, in Athens, when Aeschylus was bringing\nout a tragedy, painted a scene, and left a commentary about it. This led\nDemocritus and Anaxagoras to write on the same subject, showing how,\ngiven a centre in a definite place, the lines should naturally\ncorrespond with due regard to the point of sight and the divergence of\nthe visual rays, so that by this deception a faithful representation of\nthe appearance of buildings might be given in painted scenery, and so\nthat, though all is drawn on a vertical flat fa\u00e7ade, some parts may seem\nto be withdrawing into the background, and others to be standing out in\nfront.\n12. Afterwards Silenus published a book on the proportions of Doric\nstructures; Theodorus, on the Doric temple of Juno which is in Samos;\nChersiphron and Metagenes, on the Ionic temple at Ephesus which is\nDiana's; Pytheos, on the Ionic fane of Minerva which is at Priene;\nIctinus and Carpion, on the Doric temple of Minerva which is on the\nacropolis of Athens; Theodorus the Phocian, on the Round Building which\nis at Delphi; Philo, on the proportions of temples, and on the naval\narsenal which was[9] at the port of Peiraeus; Hermogenes, on the Ionic\ntemple of Diana which is at Magnesia, a pseudodipteral, and on that of\nFather Bacchus at Teos, a monopteral; Arcesius, on the Corinthian\nproportions, and on the Ionic temple of Aesculapius at Tralles, which it\nis said that he built with his own hands; on the Mausoleum, Satyrus and\nPytheos who were favoured with the greatest and highest good fortune.\n[Note 9: Codd. _fuerat_.]\n13. For men whose artistic talents are believed to have won them the\nhighest renown for all time, and laurels forever green, devised and\nexecuted works of supreme excellence in this building. The decoration\nand perfection of the different fa\u00e7ades were undertaken by different\nartists in emulation with each other: Leochares, Bryaxis, Scopas,\nPraxiteles, and, as some think, Timotheus; and the distinguished\nexcellence of their art made that building famous among the seven\nwonders of the world.\n14. Then, too, many less celebrated men have written treatises on the\nlaws of symmetry, such as Nexaris, Theocydes, Demophilus, Pollis,\nLeonidas, Silanion, Melampus, Sarnacus, and Euphranor; others again on\nmachinery, such as Diades, Archytas, Archimedes, Ctesibius, Nymphodorus,\nPhilo of Byzantium, Diphilus, Democles, Charias, Polyidus, Pyrrus, and\nAgesistratus. From their commentaries I have gathered what I saw was\nuseful for the present subject, and formed it into one complete\ntreatise, and this principally, because I saw that many books in this\nfield had been published by the Greeks, but very few indeed by our\ncountrymen. Fuficius, in fact, was the first to undertake to publish a\nbook on this subject. Terentius Varro, also, in his work \"On the Nine\nSciences\" has one book on architecture, and Publius Septimius, two.\n15. But to this day nobody else seems to have bent his energies to this\nbranch of literature, although there have been, even among our\nfellow-citizens in old times, great architects who could also have\nwritten with elegance. For instance, in Athens, the architects\nAntistates, Callaeschrus, Antimachides, and Pormus laid the foundations\nwhen Peisistratus began the temple of Olympian Jove, but after his death\nthey abandoned the undertaking, on account of political troubles. Hence\nit was that when, about four hundred years later, King Antiochus\npromised to pay the expenses of that work, the huge cella, the\nsurrounding columns in dipteral arrangement, and the architraves and\nother ornaments, adjusted according to the laws of symmetry, were nobly\nconstructed with great skill and supreme knowledge by Cossutius, a\ncitizen of Rome. Moreover, this work has a name for its grandeur, not\nonly in general, but also among the select few.\n16. There are, in fact, four places possessing temples embellished with\nworkmanship in marble that causes them to be mentioned in a class by\nthemselves with the highest renown. To their great excellence and the\nwisdom of their conception they owe their place of esteem in the\nceremonial worship of the gods. First there is the temple of Diana at\nEphesus, in the Ionic style, undertaken by Chersiphron of Gnosus and his\nson Metagenes, and said to have been finished later by Demetrius, who\nwas himself a slave of Diana, and by Paeonius the Milesian. At Miletus,\nthe temple of Apollo, also Ionic in its proportions, was the undertaking\nof the same Paeonius and of the Ephesian Daphnis. At Eleusis, the cella\nof Ceres and Proserpine, of vast size, was completed to the roof by\nIctinus in the Doric style, but without exterior columns and with plenty\nof room for the customary sacrifices.\n17. Afterwards, however, when Demetrius of Phalerum was master of\nAthens, Philo set up columns in front before the temple, and made it\nprostyle. Thus, by adding an entrance hall, he gave the initiates more\nroom, and imparted the greatest dignity to the building. Finally, in\nAthens, the temple of the Olympion with its dimensions on a generous\nscale, and built in the Corinthian style and proportions, is said to\nhave been constructed, as written above, by Cossutius, no commentary by\nwhom has been found. But Cossutius is not the only man by whom we should\nlike to have writings on our subject. Another is Gaius Mucius, who,\nhaving great knowledge on which to rely, completed the cella, columns,\nand entablature of the Marian temple of Honour and Valour, in\nsymmetrical proportions according to the accepted rules of the art. If\nthis building had been of marble, so that besides the refinement of its\nart it possessed the dignity coming from magnificence and great outlay,\nit would be reckoned among the first and greatest of works.\n18. Since it appears, then, that our architects in the old days, and a\ngood many even in our own times, have been as great as those of the\nGreeks, and nevertheless only a few of them have published treatises, I\nresolved not to be silent, but to treat the different topics\nmethodically in different books. Hence, since I have given an account of\nprivate houses in the sixth book, in this, which is the seventh in\norder, I shall treat of polished finishings and the methods of giving\nthem both beauty and durability.\nCHAPTER I\nFLOORS\n1. First I shall begin with the concrete flooring, which is the most\nimportant of the polished finishings, observing that great pains and the\nutmost precaution must be taken to ensure its durability. If this\nconcrete flooring is to be laid level with the ground, let the soil be\ntested to see whether it is everywhere solid, and if it is, level it off\nand upon it lay the broken stone with its bedding. But if the floor is\neither wholly or partly filling, it should be rammed down hard with\ngreat care. In case a wooden framework is used, however, we must see\nthat no wall which does not reach up to the top of the house is\nconstructed under the floor. Any wall which is there should preferably\nfall short, so as to leave the wooden planking above it an unsupported\nspan. If a wall comes up solid, the unyielding nature of its solid\nstructure must, when the joists begin to dry, or to sag and settle, lead\nto cracks in the floor on the right and left along the line of wall.\n2. We must also be careful that no common oak gets in with the winter\noak boards, for as soon as common oak boards get damp, they warp and\ncause cracks in floors. But if there is no winter oak, and necessity\ndrives, for lack of this it seems advisable to use common oak boards cut\npretty thin; for the less thick they are, the more easily they can be\nheld in place by being nailed on. Then, at the ends of every joist, nail\non two boards so that they shall not be able to warp and stick up at the\nedges. As for Turkey oak or beech or ash, none of them can last to a\ngreat age.\nWhen the wooden planking is finished, cover it with fern, if there is\nany, otherwise with straw, to protect the wood from being hurt by the\nlime.\n3. Then, upon this lay the bedding, composed of stones not smaller than\ncan fill the hand. After the bedding is laid, mix the broken stone in\nthe proportions, if it is new, of three parts to one of lime; if it is\nold material used again, five parts may answer to two in the mixture.\nNext, lay the mixture of broken stone, bring on your gangs, and beat it\nagain and again with wooden beetles into a solid mass, and let it be not\nless than three quarters of a foot in thickness when the beating is\nfinished. On this lay the nucleus, consisting of pounded tile mixed with\nlime in the proportions of three parts to one, and forming a layer not\nless than six digits thick. On top of the nucleus, the floor, whether\nmade of cut slips or of cubes, should be well and truly laid by rule and\nlevel.\n4. After it is laid and set at the proper inclination, let it be rubbed\ndown so that, if it consists of cut slips, the lozenges, or triangles,\nor squares, or hexagons may not stick up at different levels, but be all\njointed together on the same plane with one another; if it is laid in\ncubes, so that all the edges may be level; for the rubbing down will not\nbe properly finished unless all the edges are on the same level plane.\nThe herring-bone pattern, made of Tibur burnt brick, must also be\ncarefully finished, so as to be without gaps or ridges sticking up, but\nall flat and rubbed down to rule. When the rubbing down is completely\nfinished by means of the smoothing and polishing processes, sift\npowdered marble on top, and lay on a coating of lime and sand.\n5. In the open air, specially adapted kinds of floors must be made,\nbecause their framework, swelling with dampness, or shrinking from\ndryness, or sagging and settling, injures the floors by these changes;\nbesides, the frost and rime will not let them go unhurt. Hence, if\nnecessity drives, we must proceed as follows in order to make them as\nfree from defects as possible. After finishing the plank flooring, lay a\nsecond plank flooring over it at right angles, and nail it down so as to\ngive double protection to the framework. Then, mix with new broken stone\none third the quantity of pounded tile, and let lime be added to the\nmixture in the mortar trough in the proportion of two parts to five.\n6. Having made the bedding, lay on this mixture of broken stone, and\nlet it be not less than a foot thick when the beating is finished. Then,\nafter laying the nucleus, as above described, construct the floor of\nlarge cubes cut about two digits each way, and let it have an\ninclination of two digits for every ten feet. If it is well put together\nand properly rubbed down, it will be free from all flaws. In order that\nthe mortar in the joints may not suffer from frosts, drench it with\noil-dregs every year before winter begins. Thus treated, it will not let\nthe hoarfrost enter it.\n7. If, however, it seems needful to use still greater care, lay two-foot\ntiles, jointed together in a bed of mortar, over the broken stone, with\nlittle channels of one finger's breadth cut in the faces of all the\njoints. Connect these channels and fill them with a mixture of lime and\noil; then, rub the joints hard and make them compact. Thus, the lime\nsticking in the channels will harden and solidify into a mass, and so\nprevent water or anything else from penetrating through the joints.\nAfter this layer is finished, spread the nucleus upon it, and work it\ndown by beating it with rods. Upon this lay the floor, at the\ninclination above described, either of large cubes or burnt brick in\nherring-bone pattern, and floors thus constructed will not soon be\nspoiled.\nCHAPTER II\nTHE SLAKING OF LIME FOR STUCCO\n1. Leaving the subject of floors, we must next treat of stucco work.\nThis will be all right if the best lime, taken in lumps, is slaked a\ngood while before it is to be used, so that if any lump has not been\nburned long enough in the kiln, it will be forced to throw off its heat\nduring the long course of slaking in the water, and will thus be\nthoroughly burned to the same consistency. When it is taken not\nthoroughly slaked but fresh, it has little crude bits concealed in it,\nand so, when applied, it blisters. When such bits complete their slaking\nafter they are on the building, they break up and spoil the smooth\npolish of the stucco.\n2. But when the proper attention has been paid to the slaking, and\ngreater pains have thus been employed in the preparation for the work,\ntake a hoe, and apply it to the slaked lime in the mortar bed just as\nyou hew wood. If it sticks to the hoe in bits, the lime is not yet\ntempered; and when the iron is drawn out dry and clean, it will show\nthat the lime is weak and thirsty; but when the lime is rich and\nproperly slaked, it will stick to the tool like glue, proving that it is\ncompletely tempered. Then get the scaffolding ready, and proceed to\nconstruct the vaultings in the rooms, unless they are to be decorated\nwith flat coffered ceilings.\nCHAPTER III\nVAULTINGS AND STUCCO WORK\n1. When vaulting is required, the procedure should be as follows. Set up\nhorizontal furring strips at intervals of not more than two feet apart,\nusing preferably cypress, as fir is soon spoiled by decay and by age.\nArrange these strips so as to form a curve, and make them fast to the\njoists of the floor above or to the roof, if it is there, by nailing\nthem with many iron nails to ties fixed at intervals. These ties should\nbe made of a kind of wood that neither decay nor time nor dampness can\nspoil, such as box, juniper, olive, oak, cypress, or any other similar\nwood except common oak; for this warps, and causes cracks in work in\nwhich it is used.\n2. Having arranged the furring strips, take cord made of Spanish broom,\nand tie Greek reeds, previously pounded flat, to them in the required\ncontour. Immediately above the vaulting spread some mortar made of lime\nand sand, to check any drops that may fall from the joists or from the\nroof. If a supply of Greek reed is not to be had, gather slender marsh\nreeds, and make them up with silk cord into bundles all of the same\nthickness and adjusted to the proper length, provided that the bundles\nare not more than two feet long between any two knots. Then tie them\nwith cord to the beams, as above described, and drive wooden pegs into\nthem. Make all the other preparations as above described.\n3. Having thus set the vaultings in their places and interwoven them,\napply the rendering coat to their lower surface; then lay on the sand\nmortar, and afterwards polish it off with the powdered marble. After the\nvaultings have been polished, set the impost mouldings directly beneath\nthem. These obviously ought to be made extremely slender and delicate,\nfor when they are large, their weight carries them down, and they cannot\nsupport themselves. Gypsum should by no means be used in their\ncomposition, but powdered marble should be laid on uniformly, lest\ngypsum, by setting too quickly should keep the work from drying\nuniformly. We must also beware of the ancients' scheme for vaultings;\nfor in their mouldings the soffits overhang very heavily, and are\ndangerous.\n4. Some mouldings are flat, others in relief. In rooms where there has\nto be a fire or a good many lights, they should be flat, so that they\ncan be wiped off more easily. In summer apartments and in exedrae where\nthere is no smoke nor soot to hurt them, they should be made in relief.\nIt is always the case that stucco, in the pride of its dazzling white,\ngathers smoke not only from its own house but also from others.\n5. Having finished the mouldings, apply a very rough rendering coat to\nthe walls, and afterwards, when the rendering coat gets pretty dry,\nspread upon it the layers of sand mortar, exactly adjusted in length to\nrule and line, in height to the plummet, and at the angles to the\nsquare. The stucco will thus present a faultless appearance for\npaintings. When it gets pretty dry, spread on a second coat and then a\nthird. The better the foundation of sand mortar that is laid on, the\nstronger and more durable in its solidity will be the stucco.\n6. When not less than three coats of sand mortar, besides the rendering\ncoat, have been laid on, then, we must make the mixture for the layers\nof powdered marble, the mortar being so tempered that when mixed it does\nnot stick to the trowel, but the iron comes out freely and clean from\nthe mortar trough. After this powdered marble has been spread on and\ngets dry, lay on a medium second coat. When that has been applied and\nwell rubbed down, spread on a finer coat. The walls, being thus rendered\nsolid by three coats of sand mortar and as many of marble, will not\npossibly be liable to cracks or to any other defect.\n7. And further, such walls, owing to the solid foundation given by\nthorough working with polishing instruments, and the smoothness of it,\ndue to the hard and dazzling white marble, will bring out in brilliant\nsplendour the colours which are laid on at the same time with the\npolishing.\nThese colours, when they are carefully laid on stucco still wet, do not\nfade but are permanent. This is because the lime, having had its\nmoisture burned out in the kiln, becomes porous and loses its strength,\nand its dryness makes it take up anything that may come in contact with\nit. On mixing with the seeds or elements that come from other\nsubstances, it forms a solid mass with them and, no matter what the\nconstituent parts may then be, it must, obviously, on becoming dry,\npossess the qualities which are peculiar to its own nature.\n8. Hence, stucco that is properly made does not get rough as time goes\non, nor lose its colours when it is wiped off, unless they have been\nlaid on with little care and after it is dry. So, when the stucco on\nwalls is made as described above, it will have strength and brilliancy,\nand an excellence that will last to a great age. But when only one coat\nof sand mortar and one of fine marble have been spread on, its thin\nlayer is easily cracked from want of strength, and from its lack of\nthickness it will not take on the brilliance, due to polishing, which it\nought to have.\n9. Just as a silver mirror that is formed of a thin plate reflects\nindistinctly and with a feeble light, while one that is substantially\nmade can take on a very high polish, and reflects a brilliant and\ndistinct image when one looks therein, so it is with stucco. When the\nstuff of which it is formed is thin, it not only cracks but also soon\nfades; when, however, it has a solid foundation of sand mortar and of\nmarble, thickly and compactly applied, it is not only brilliant after\nbeing subjected to repeated polishings, but also reflects from its\nsurface a clear image of the beholder.\n10. The Greek stucco-workers not only employ these methods to make their\nworks durable, but also construct a mortar trough, mix the lime and sand\nin it, bring on a gang of men, and beat the stuff with wooden beetles,\nand do not use it until it has been thus vigorously worked. Hence, some\ncut slabs out of old walls and use them as panels, and the stucco of\nsuch panels and \"reflectors\" has projecting bevelled edges all round it.\n11. But if stucco has to be made on \"wattle and daub,\" where there must\nbe cracks at the uprights and cross-sticks, because they must take in\nmoisture when they are daubed with the mud, and cause cracks in the\nstucco when they dry and shrink, the following method will prevent this\nfrom happening. After the whole wall has been smeared with the mud, nail\nrows of reeds to it by means of \"fly-nails,\" then spread on the mud a\nsecond time, and, if the first rows have been nailed with the shafts\ntransverse, nail on a second set with the shafts vertical, and then, as\nabove described, spread on the sand mortar, the marble, and the whole\nmass of stucco. Thus, the double series of reeds with their shafts\ncrossing on the walls will prevent any chipping or cracking from taking\nplace.\nCHAPTER IV\nON STUCCO WORK IN DAMP PLACES, AND ON THE DECORATION OF DINING ROOMS\n1. Having spoken of the method by which stucco work should be done in\ndry situations, I shall next explain how the polished finish is to be\naccomplished in places that are damp, in such a way that it can last\nwithout defects. First, in apartments which are level with the ground,\napply a rendering coat of mortar, mixed with burnt brick instead of\nsand, to a height of about three feet above the floor, and then lay on\nthe stucco so that those portions of it may not be injured by the\ndampness. But if a wall is in a state of dampness all over, construct a\nsecond thin wall a little way from it on the inside, at a distance\nsuited to circumstances, and in the space between these two walls run a\nchannel, at a lower level than that of the apartment, with vents to the\nopen air. Similarly, when the wall is brought up to the top, leave\nairholes there. For if the moisture has no means of getting out by vents\nat the bottom and at the top, it will not fail to spread all over the\nnew wall. This done, apply a rendering coat of mortar made with burnt\nbrick to this wall, spread on the layer of stucco, and polish it.\n2. But if there is not room enough for the construction of a wall, make\nchannels with their vents extending to the open air. Then lay two-foot\ntiles resting on the margin of the channel on one side, and on the other\nside construct a foundation of pillars for them, made of eight-inch\nbricks, on top of each of which the edges of two tiles may be supported,\neach pillar being not more than a hand's breadth distant from the wall.\nThen, above, set hooked tiles fastened to the wall from bottom to top,\ncarefully covering the inner sides of them with pitch so that they will\nreject moisture. Both at the bottom and at the top above the vaulting\nthey should have airholes.\n3. Then, whitewash them with lime and water so that they will not reject\nthe rendering coat of burnt brick. For, as they are dry from the loss of\nwater burnt out in the kiln, they can neither take nor hold the\nrendering coat unless lime has been applied beneath it to stick the two\nsubstances together, and make them unite. After spreading the rendering\ncoat upon this, apply layers of burnt brick mortar instead of sand\nmortar, and finish up all the rest in the manner described above for\nstucco work.\n4. The decorations of the polished surfaces of the walls ought to be\ntreated with due regard to propriety, so as to be adapted to their\nsituations, and not out of keeping with differences in kind. In winter\ndining rooms, neither paintings on grand subjects nor delicacy of\ndecoration in the cornice work of the vaultings is a serviceable kind\nof design, because they are spoiled by the smoke from the fire and the\nconstant soot from the lamps. In these rooms there should be panels\nabove the dadoes, worked in black, and polished, with yellow ochre or\nvermilion blocks interposed between them. After the vaulting has been\ntreated in the flat style, and polished, the Greek method of making\nfloors for use in winter dining rooms may not be unworthy of one's\nnotice, as being very inexpensive and yet serviceable.\n5. An excavation is made below the level of the dining room to a depth\nof about two feet, and, after the ground has been rammed down, the mass\nof broken stones or the pounded burnt brick is spread on, at such an\ninclination that it can find vents in the drain. Next, having filled in\nwith charcoal compactly trodden down, a mortar mixed of gravel, lime,\nand ashes is spread on to a depth of half a foot. The surface having\nbeen made true to rule and level, and smoothed off with whetstone, gives\nthe look of a black pavement. Hence, at their dinner parties, whatever\nis poured out of the cups, or spirted from the mouth, no sooner falls\nthan it dries up, and the servants who wait there do not catch cold from\nthat kind of floor, although they may go barefoot.\nCHAPTER V\nTHE DECADENCE OF FRESCO PAINTING\n1. For the other apartments, that is, those intended to be used in\nSpring, Autumn, and Summer, as well as for atriums and peristyles, the\nancients required realistic pictures of real things. A picture is, in\nfact, a representation of a thing which really exists or which can\nexist: for example, a man, a house, a ship, or anything else from whose\ndefinite and actual structure copies resembling it can be taken.\nConsequently the ancients who introduced polished finishings began by\nrepresenting different kinds of marble slabs in different positions, and\nthen cornices and blocks of yellow ochre arranged in various ways.\n2. Afterwards they made such progress as to represent the forms of\nbuildings, and of columns, and projecting and overhanging pediments; in\ntheir open rooms, such as exedrae, on account of the size, they depicted\nthe fa\u00e7ades of scenes in the tragic, comic, or satyric style; and their\nwalks, on account of the great length, they decorated with a variety of\nlandscapes, copying the characteristics of definite spots. In these\npaintings there are harbours, promontories, seashores, rivers,\nfountains, straits, fanes, groves, mountains, flocks, shepherds; in some\nplaces there are also pictures designed in the grand style, with figures\nof the gods or detailed mythological episodes, or the battles at Troy,\nor the wanderings of Ulysses, with landscape backgrounds, and other\nsubjects reproduced on similar principles from real life.\n3. But those subjects which were copied from actual realities are\nscorned in these days of bad taste. We now have fresco paintings of\nmonstrosities, rather than truthful representations of definite things.\nFor instance, reeds are put in the place of columns, fluted appendages\nwith curly leaves and volutes, instead of pediments, candelabra\nsupporting representations of shrines, and on top of their pediments\nnumerous tender stalks and volutes growing up from the roots and having\nhuman figures senselessly seated upon them; sometimes stalks having only\nhalf-length figures, some with human heads, others with the heads of\nanimals.\n4. Such things do not exist and cannot exist and never have existed.\nHence, it is the new taste that has caused bad judges of poor art to\nprevail over true artistic excellence. For how is it possible that a\nreed should really support a roof, or a candelabrum a pediment with its\nornaments, or that such a slender, flexible thing as a stalk should\nsupport a figure perched upon it, or that roots and stalks should\nproduce now flowers and now half-length figures? Yet when people see\nthese frauds, they find no fault with them but on the contrary are\ndelighted, and do not care whether any of them can exist or not. Their\nunderstanding is darkened by decadent critical principles, so that it is\nnot capable of giving its approval authoritatively and on the principle\nof propriety to that which really can exist. The fact is that pictures\nwhich are unlike reality ought not to be approved, and even if they are\ntechnically fine, this is no reason why they should offhand be judged to\nbe correct, if their subject is lacking in the principles of reality\ncarried out with no violations.\n5. For instance, at Tralles, Apaturius of Alabanda designed with skilful\nhand the scaena of the little theatre which is there called the [Greek:\nekkl\u00easiast\u00earion], representing columns in it and statues, Centaurs\nsupporting the architraves, rotundas with round roofs on them, pediments\nwith overhanging returns, and cornices ornamented with lions' heads,\nwhich are meant for nothing but the rainwater from the roofs,--and then\non top of it all he made an episcaenium in which were painted rotundas,\nporticoes, half-pediments, and all the different kinds of decoration\nemployed in a roof. The effect of high relief in this scaena was very\nattractive to all who beheld it, and they were ready to give their\napproval to the work, when Licymnius the mathematician came forward and\nsaid that (6.) the Alabandines were considered bright enough in all\nmatters of politics, but that on account of one slight defect, the lack\nof the sense of propriety, they were believed to be unintelligent. \"In\ntheir gymnasium the statues are all pleading causes, in their forum,\nthrowing the discus, running, or playing ball. This disregard of\npropriety in the interchange of statues appropriate to different places\nhas brought the state as a whole into disrepute. Let us then beware lest\nthis scaena of Apaturius make Alabandines or Abderites of us. Which of\nyou can have houses or columns or extensive pediments on top of his\ntiled roof? Such things are built above the floors, not above the tiled\nroofs. Therefore, if we give our approval to pictures of things which\ncan have no reason for existence in actual fact, we shall be voluntarily\nassociating ourselves with those communities which are believed to be\nunintelligent on account of just such defects.\"\n7. Apaturius did not venture to make any answer, but removed the\nscaena, altered it so that it conformed to reality, and gave\nsatisfaction with it in its improved state. Would to God that Licymnius\ncould come to life again and reform the present condition of folly and\nmistaken practices in fresco painting! However, it may not be out of\nplace to explain why this false method prevails over the truth. The fact\nis that the artistic excellence which the ancients endeavoured to attain\nby working hard and taking pains, is now attempted by the use of colours\nand the brave show which they make, and expenditure by the employer\nprevents people from missing the artistic refinements that once lent\nauthority to works.\n8. For example, which of the ancients can be found to have used\nvermilion otherwise than sparingly, like a drug? But today whole walls\nare commonly covered with it everywhere. Then, too, there is malachite\ngreen, purple, and Armenian blue. When these colours are laid on, they\npresent a brilliant appearance to the eye even although they are\ninartistically applied, and as they are costly, they are made exceptions\nin contracts, to be furnished by the employer, not by the contractor.\nI have now sufficiently explained all that I could suggest for the\navoidance of mistakes in stucco work. Next, I shall speak of the\ncomponents as they occur to me, and first I shall treat of marble, since\nI spoke of lime at the beginning.\nCHAPTER VI\nMARBLE FOR USE IN STUCCO\nMarble is not produced everywhere of the same kind. In some places the\nlumps are found to contain transparent grains like salt, and this kind\nwhen crushed and ground is extremely serviceable in stucco work. In\nplaces where this is not found, the broken bits of marble or \"chips,\" as\nthey are called, which marble-workers throw down as they work, may be\ncrushed and ground and used in stucco after being sifted. In still other\nplaces--for example, on the borderland of Magnesia and Ephesus--there\nare places where it can be dug out all ready to use, without the need of\ngrinding or sifting, but as fine as any that is crushed and sifted by\nhand.\nCHAPTER VII\nNATURAL COLOURS\nAs for colours, some are natural products found in fixed places, and dug\nup there, while others are artificial compounds of different substances\ntreated and mixed in proper proportions so as to be equally serviceable.\n1. We shall first set forth the natural colours that are dug up as such,\nlike yellow ochre, which is termed [Greek: \u00f4chra] in Greek. This is\nfound in many places, including Italy, but Attic, which was the best, is\nnot now to be had because in the times when there were slaves in the\nAthenian silver mines, they would dig galleries underground in order to\nfind the silver. Whenever a vein of ochre was found there, they would\nfollow it up like silver, and so the ancients had a fine supply of it to\nuse in the polished finishings of their stucco work.\n2. Red earths are found in abundance in many places, but the best in\nonly a few, for instance at Sinope in Pontus, in Egypt, in the Balearic\nislands of Spain, as well as in Lemnos, an island the enjoyment of whose\nrevenues the Senate and Roman people granted to the Athenians.\n3. Paraetonium white gets its name from the place where it is dug up.\nThe same is the case with Melian white, because there is said to be a\nmine of it in Melos, one of the islands of the Cyclades.\n4. Green chalk is found in numerous places, but the best at Smyrna. The\nGreeks call it [Greek: theodoteion], because this kind of chalk was\nfirst found on the estate of a person named Theodotus.\n5. Orpiment, which is termed [Greek: arsenikon] in Greek, is dug up in\nPontus. Sandarach, in many places, but the best is mined in Pontus close\nby the river Hypanis.\nCHAPTER VIII\nCINNABAR AND QUICKSILVER\n1. I shall now proceed to explain the nature of cinnabar. It is said\nthat it was first found in the Cilbian country belonging to Ephesus, and\nboth it and its properties are certainly very strange. First, before\ngetting to the vermilion itself by methods of treatment, they dig out\nwhat is called the clod, an ore like iron, but rather of a reddish\ncolour and covered with a red dust. During the digging it sheds, under\nthe blows of the tools, tear after tear of quicksilver, which is at once\ngathered up by the diggers.\n2. When these clods have been collected, they are so full of moisture\nthat they are thrown into an oven in the laboratory to dry, and the\nfumes that are sent up from them by the heat of the fire settle down on\nthe floor of the oven, and are found to be quicksilver. When the clods\nare taken out, the drops which remain are so small that they cannot be\ngathered up, but they are swept into a vessel of water, and there they\nrun together and combine into one. Four pints of it, when measured and\nweighed, will be found to be one hundred pounds.\n3. If the quicksilver is poured into a vessel, and a stone weighing one\nhundred pounds is laid upon it, the stone swims on the surface, and\ncannot depress the liquid, nor break through, nor separate it. If we\nremove the hundred pound weight, and put on a scruple of gold, it will\nnot swim, but will sink to the bottom of its own accord. Hence, it is\nundeniable that the gravity of a substance depends not on the amount of\nits weight, but on its nature.\n4. Quicksilver is a useful thing for many purposes. For instance,\nneither silver nor copper can be gilded properly without it. And when\ngold has been woven into a garment, and the garment becomes worn out\nwith age so that it is no longer respectable to use, the pieces of cloth\nare put into earthen pots, and burned up over a fire. The ashes are then\nthrown into water and quicksilver added thereto. This attracts all the\nbits of gold, and makes them combine with itself. The water is then\npoured off, and the rest emptied into a cloth and squeezed in the hands,\nwhereupon the quicksilver, being a liquid, escapes through the loose\ntexture of the cloth, but the gold, which has been brought together by\nthe squeezing, is found inside in a pure state.\nCHAPTER IX\nCINNABAR (_continued_)\n1. I will now return to the preparation of vermilion. When the lumps of\nore are dry, they are crushed in iron mortars, and repeatedly washed and\nheated until the impurities are gone, and the colours come. When the\ncinnabar has given up its quicksilver, and thus lost the natural virtues\nthat it previously had, it becomes soft in quality and its powers are\nfeeble.\n2. Hence, though it keeps its colour perfectly when applied in the\npolished stucco finish of closed apartments, yet in open apartments,\nsuch as peristyles or exedrae or other places of the sort, where the\nbright rays of the sun and moon can penetrate, it is spoiled by contact\nwith them, loses the strength of its colour, and turns black. Among many\nothers, the secretary Faberius, who wished to have his house on the\nAventine finished in elegant style, applied vermilion to all the walls\nof the peristyle; but after thirty days they turned to an ugly and\nmottled colour. He therefore made a contract to have other colours\napplied instead of vermilion.\n3. But anybody who is more particular, and who wants a polished finish\nof vermilion that will keep its proper colour, should, after the wall\nhas been polished and is dry, apply with a brush Pontic wax melted over\na fire and mixed with a little oil; then after this he should bring the\nwax to a sweat by warming it and the wall at close quarters with\ncharcoal enclosed in an iron vessel; and finally he should smooth it all\noff by rubbing it down with a wax candle and clean linen cloths, just\nas naked marble statues are treated.\n4. This process is termed [Greek: gan\u00f4sis] in Greek. The protecting coat\nof Pontic wax prevents the light of the moon and the rays of the sun\nfrom licking up and drawing the colour out of such polished finishing.\nThe manufactories which were once at the mines of the Ephesians have now\nbeen transferred to Rome, because this kind of ore was later discovered\nin Spain. The clods are brought from the mines there, and treated in\nRome by public contractors. These manufactories are between the temples\nof Flora and Quirinus.\n5. Cinnabar is adulterated by mixing lime with it. Hence, one will have\nto proceed as follows, if one wishes to prove that it is unadulterated.\nTake an iron plate, put the cinnabar upon it, and lay it on the fire\nuntil the plate gets red hot. When the glowing heat makes the colour\nchange and turn black, remove the plate from the fire, and if the\ncinnabar when cooled returns to its former colour, it will be proved to\nbe unadulterated; but if it keeps the black colour, it will show that it\nhas been adulterated.\n6. I have now said all that I could think of about cinnabar. Malachite\ngreen is brought from Macedonia, and is dug up in the neighbourhood of\ncopper mines. The names Armenian blue and India ink show in what places\nthese substances are found.\nCHAPTER X\nARTIFICIAL COLOURS. BLACK\n1. I shall now pass to those substances which by artificial treatment\nare made to change their composition, and to take on the properties of\ncolours; and first I shall treat of black, the use of which is\nindispensable in many works, in order that the fixed technical methods\nfor the preparation of that compound may be known.\n2. A place is built like a Laconicum, and nicely finished in marble,\nsmoothly polished. In front of it, a small furnace is constructed with\nvents into the Laconicum, and with a stokehole that can be very\ncarefully closed to prevent the flames from escaping and being wasted.\nResin is placed in the furnace. The force of the fire in burning it\ncompels it to give out soot into the Laconicum through the vents, and\nthe soot sticks to the walls and the curved vaulting. It is gathered\nfrom them, and some of it is mixed and worked with gum for use as\nwriting ink, while the rest is mixed with size, and used on walls by\nfresco painters.\n3. But if these facilities are not at hand, we must meet the exigency as\nfollows, so that the work may not be hindered by tedious delay. Burn\nshavings and splinters of pitch pine, and when they turn to charcoal,\nput them out, and pound them in a mortar with size. This will make a\npretty black for fresco painting.\n4. Again, if the lees of wine are dried and roasted in an oven, and then\nground up with size and applied to a wall, the result will be a colour\neven more delightful than ordinary black; and the better the wine of\nwhich it is made, the better imitation it will give, not only of the\ncolour of ordinary black, but even of that of India ink.\nCHAPTER XI\nBLUE. BURNT OCHRE\n1. Methods of making blue were first discovered in Alexandria, and\nafterwards Vestorius set up the making of it at Puzzuoli. The method of\nobtaining it from the substances of which it has been found to consist,\nis strange enough. Sand and the flowers of natron are brayed together so\nfinely that the product is like meal, and copper is grated by means of\ncoarse files over the mixture, like sawdust, to form a conglomerate.\nThen it is made into balls by rolling it in the hands and thus bound\ntogether for drying. The dry balls are put in an earthern jar, and the\njars in an oven. As soon as the copper and the sand grow hot and unite\nunder the intensity of the fire, they mutually receive each other's\nsweat, relinquishing their peculiar qualities, and having lost their\nproperties through the intensity of the fire, they are reduced to a blue\ncolour.\n2. Burnt ochre, which is very serviceable in stucco work, is made as\nfollows. A clod of good yellow ochre is heated to a glow on a fire. It\nis then quenched in vinegar, and the result is a purple colour.\nCHAPTER XII\nWHITE LEAD, VERDIGRIS, AND ARTIFICIAL SANDARACH\n1. It is now in place to describe the preparation of white lead and of\nverdigris, which with us is called \"aeruca.\" In Rhodes they put shavings\nin jars, pour vinegar over them, and lay pieces of lead on the shavings;\nthen they cover the jars with lids to prevent evaporation. After a\ndefinite time they open them, and find that the pieces of lead have\nbecome white lead. In the same way they put in plates of copper and make\nverdigris, which is called \"aeruca.\"\n2. White lead on being heated in an oven changes its colour on the fire,\nand becomes sandarach. This was discovered as the result of an\naccidental fire. It is much more serviceable than the natural sandarach\ndug up in mines.\nCHAPTER XIII\nPURPLE\n1. I shall now begin to speak of purple, which exceeds all the colours\nthat have so far been mentioned both in costliness and in the\nsuperiority of its delightful effect. It is obtained from a marine\nshellfish, from which is made the purple dye, which is as wonderful to\nthe careful observer as anything else in nature; for it has not the\nsame shade in all the places where it is found, but is naturally\nqualified by the course of the sun.\n2. That which is found in Pontus and Gaul is black, because those\ncountries are nearest to the north. As one passes on from north to west,\nit is found of a bluish shade. Due east and west, what is found is of a\nviolet shade. That which is obtained in southern countries is naturally\nred in quality, and therefore this is found in the island of Rhodes and\nin other such countries that are nearest to the course of the sun.\n3. After the shellfish have been gathered, they are broken up with iron\ntools, the blows of which drive out the purple fluid like a flood of\ntears, and then it is prepared by braying it in mortars. It is called\n\"ostrum\" because it is taken from the shells of marine shellfish. On\naccount of its saltness, it soon dries up unless it has honey poured\nover it.\nCHAPTER XIV\nSUBSTITUTES FOR PURPLE, YELLOW OCHRE, MALACHITE GREEN, AND INDIGO\n1. Purple colours are also manufactured by dyeing chalk with madder root\nand with hysginum. Other colours are made from flowers. Thus, when\nfresco painters wish to imitate Attic yellow ochre, they put dried\nviolets into a vessel of water, and heat them over a fire; then, when\nthe mixture is ready, they pour it onto a linen cloth, and squeeze it\nout with the hands, catching the water which is now coloured by the\nviolets, in a mortar. Into this they pour chalk and bray it, obtaining\nthe colour of Attic yellow ochre.\n2. They make a fine purple colour by treating bilberry in the same way\nand mixing it with milk. Those who cannot use malachite green on account\nof its dearness, dye blue with the plant called dyer's weed, and thus\nobtain a most vivid green. This is called dyer's malachite green. Again,\nfor want of indigo, they dye Selinusian or anularian chalk with woad,\nwhich the Greeks call [Greek: isatis], and make an imitation of indigo.\n3. In this book I have written down, so far as I could recall them, the\nmethods and means of attaining durability in polished finishings, how\npictures that are appropriate should be made, and also the natural\nqualities of all the colours. And so, having prescribed in seven books\nthe suitable principles which should govern the construction of all\nkinds of buildings, I shall treat in the next of water, showing how it\nmay be found in places where it is wanting, by what method it may be\nconducted, and by what means its wholesomeness and fitness may be\ntested.\nBOOK VIII\nINTRODUCTION\n1. Among the Seven Sages, Thales of Miletus pronounced for water as the\nprimordial element in all things; Heraclitus, for fire; the priests of\nthe Magi, for water and fire; Euripides, a pupil of Anaxagoras, and\ncalled by the Athenians \"the philosopher of the stage,\" for air and\nearth. Earth, he held, was impregnated by the rains of heaven and, thus\nconceiving, brought forth the young of mankind and of all the living\ncreatures in the world; whatever is sprung from her goes back to her\nagain when the compelling force of time brings about a dissolution; and\nwhatever is born of the air returns in the same way to the regions of\nthe sky; nothing suffers annihilation, but at dissolution there is a\nchange, and things fall back to the essential element in which they were\nbefore. But Pythagoras, Empedocles, Epicharmus, and other physicists and\nphilosophers have set forth that the primordial elements are four in\nnumber: air, fire, earth, and water; and that it is from their coherence\nto one another under the moulding power of nature that the qualities of\nthings are produced according to different classes.\n2. And, in fact, we see not only that all which comes to birth is\nproduced by them, but also that nothing can be nourished without their\ninfluence, nor grow, nor be preserved. The body, for example, can have\nno life without the flow of the breath to and fro, that is, unless an\nabundance of air flows in, causing dilations and contractions in regular\nsuccession. Without the right proportion of heat, the body will lack\nvitality, will not be well set up, and will not properly digest strong\nfood. Again, without the fruits of the earth to nourish the bodily\nframe, it will be enfeebled, and so lose its admixture of the earthy\nelement.\n3. Finally, without the influence of moisture, living creatures will be\nbloodless and, having the liquid element sucked out of them, will\nwither away. Accordingly the divine intelligence has not made what is\nreally indispensable for man either hard to get or costly, like pearls,\ngold, silver, and so forth, the lack of which neither our body nor our\nnature feels, but has spread abroad, ready to hand through all the\nworld, the things without which the life of mortals cannot be\nmaintained. Thus, to take examples, suppose there is a deficiency of\nbreath in the body, the air, to which is assigned the function of making\nup the deficiency, performs that service. To supply heat, the mighty sun\nis ready, and the invention of fire makes life more secure. Then again,\nthe fruits of the earth, satisfying our desires with a more than\nsufficient store of food stuffs, support and maintain living beings with\nregular nourishment. Finally, water, not merely supplying drink but\nfilling an infinite number of practical needs, does us services which\nmake us grateful because it is gratis.\n4. Hence, too, those who are clothed in priesthoods of the Egyptian\norders declare that all things depend upon the power of the liquid\nelement. So, when the waterpot is brought back to precinct and temple\nwith water, in accordance with the holy rite, they throw themselves upon\nthe ground and, raising their hands to heaven, thank the divine\nbenevolence for its invention.\nTherefore, since it is held by physicists and philosophers and priests\nthat all things depend upon the power of water, I have thought that, as\nin the former seven books the rules for buildings have been set forth,\nin this I ought to write on the methods of finding water, on those\nspecial merits which are due to the qualities of localities, on the ways\nof conducting it, and how it may be tested in advance. For it is the\nchief requisite for life, for happiness, and for everyday use.\nCHAPTER I\nHOW TO FIND WATER\n1. This will be easier if there are open springs of running water. But\nif there are no springs which gush forth, we must search for them\nunderground, and conduct them together. The following test should be\napplied. Before sunrise, lie down flat in the place where the search is\nto be made, and placing the chin on the earth and supporting it there,\ntake a look out over the country. In this way the sight will not range\nhigher than it ought, the chin being immovable, but will range over a\ndefinitely limited height on the same level through the country. Then,\ndig in places where vapours are seen curling and rising up into the air.\nThis sign cannot show itself in a dry spot.\n2. Searchers for water must also study the nature of different\nlocalities; for those in which it is found are well defined. In clay the\nsupply is poor, meagre, and at no great depth. It will not have the best\ntaste. In fine gravel the supply is also poor, but it will be found at a\ngreater depth. It will be muddy and not sweet. In black earth some\nslight drippings and drops are found that gather from the storms of\nwinter and settle down in compact, hard places. They have the best\ntaste. Among pebbles the veins found are moderate, and not to be\ndepended upon. These, too, are extremely sweet. In coarse grained gravel\nand carbuncular sand the supply is surer and more lasting, and it has a\ngood taste. In red tufa it is copious and good, if it does not run down\nthrough the fissures and escape. At the foot of mountains and in lava it\nis more plentiful and abundant, and here it is also colder and more\nwholesome. In flat countries the springs are salt, heavy-bodied, tepid,\nand ill-flavoured, excepting those which run underground from mountains,\nand burst forth in the middle of a plain, where, if protected by the\nshade of trees, their taste is equal to that of mountain springs.\n3. In the kinds of soil described above, signs will be found growing,\nsuch as slender rushes, wild willows, alders, agnus castus trees, reeds,\nivy, and other plants of the same sort that cannot spring up of\nthemselves without moisture. But they are also accustomed to grow in\ndepressions which, being lower than the rest of the country, receive\nwater from the rains and the surrounding fields during the winter, and\nkeep it for a comparatively long time on account of their holding power.\nThese must not be trusted, but the search must be made in districts and\nsoils, yet not in depressions, where those signs are found growing not\nfrom seed, but springing up naturally of themselves.\n4. If the indications mentioned appear in such places, the following\ntest should be applied. Dig out a place not less than three feet square\nand five feet deep, and put into it about sunset a bronze or leaden bowl\nor basin, whichever is at hand. Smear the inside with oil, lay it upside\ndown, and cover the top of the excavation with reeds or green boughs,\nthrowing earth upon them. Next day uncover it, and if there are drops\nand drippings in the vessel, the place will contain water.\n5. Again, if a vessel made of unbaked clay be put in the hole, and\ncovered in the same way, it will be wet when uncovered, and already\nbeginning to go to pieces from dampness, if the place contains water. If\na fleece of wool is placed in the excavation, and water can be wrung out\nof it on the following day, it will show that the place has a supply.\nFurther, if a lamp be trimmed, filled with oil, lighted, and put in that\nplace and covered up, and if on the next day it is not burnt out, but\nstill contains some remains of oil and wick, and is itself found to be\ndamp, it will indicate that the place contains water; for all heat\nattracts moisture. Again, if a fire is made in that place, and if the\nground, when thoroughly warmed and burned, sends up a misty vapour from\nits surface, the place will contain water.\n6. After applying these tests and finding the signs described above, a\nwell must next be sunk in the place, and if a spring of water is found,\nmore wells must be dug thereabouts, and all conducted by means of\nsubterranean channels into one place.\nThe mountains and districts with a northern exposure are the best spots\nin which to search, for the reason that springs are sweeter, more\nwholesome, and more abundant when found there. Such places face away\nfrom the sun's course, and the trees are thick in them, and the\nmountains, being themselves full of woods, cast shadows of their own,\npreventing the rays of the sun from striking uninterruptedly upon the\nground and drying up the moisture.\n7. The valleys among the mountains receive the rains most abundantly,\nand on account of the thick woods the snow is kept in them longer by the\nshade of the trees and mountains. Afterwards, on melting, it filters\nthrough the fissures in the ground, and thus reaches the very foot of\nthe mountains, from which gushing springs come belching out.\nBut in flat countries, on the contrary, a good supply cannot be had. For\nhowever great it is, it cannot be wholesome, because, as there is no\nshade in the way, the intense force of the sun draws up and carries off\nthe moisture from the flat plains with its heat, and if any water shows\nitself there, the lightest and purest and the delicately wholesome part\nof it is summoned away by the air, and dispersed to the skies, while the\nheaviest and the hard and unpleasant parts are left in springs that are\nin flat places.\nCHAPTER II\nRAINWATER\n1. Rainwater has, therefore, more wholesome qualities, because it is\ndrawn from the lightest and most delicately pure parts of all the\nsprings, and then, after being filtered through the agitated air, it is\nliquefied by storms and so returns to the earth. And rainfall is not\nabundant in the plains, but rather on the mountains or close to\nmountains, for the reason that the vapour which is set in motion at\nsunrise in the morning, leaves the earth, and drives the air before it\nthrough the heaven in whatever direction it inclines; then, when once in\nmotion, it has currents of air rushing after it, on account of the void\nwhich it leaves behind.\n2. This air, driving the vapour everywhere as it rushes along, produces\ngales and constantly increasing currents by its mighty blasts. Wherever\nthe winds carry the vapour which rolls in masses from springs, rivers,\nmarshes, and the sea, it is brought together by the heat of the sun,\ndrawn off, and carried upward in the form of clouds; then these clouds\nare supported by the current of air until they come to mountains, where\nthey are broken up from the shock of the collision and the gales, turn\ninto water on account of their own fulness and weight, and in that form\nare dispersed upon the earth.\n3. That vapour, mists, and humidity come forth from the earth, seems due\nto the reason that it contains burning heat, mighty currents of air,\nintense cold, and a great quantity of water. So, as soon as the earth,\nwhich has cooled off during the night, is struck by the rays of the\nrising sun, and the winds begin to blow while it is yet dark, mists\nbegin to rise upward from damp places. That the air when thoroughly\nheated by the sun can make vapours rise rolling up from the earth, may\nbe seen by means of an example drawn from baths.\n4. Of course there can be no springs above the vaultings of hot\nbathrooms, but the atmosphere in such rooms, becoming well warmed by the\nhot air from the furnaces, seizes upon the water on the floors, and\ntakes it up to the curved vaultings and holds it up there, for the\nreason that hot vapour always pushes upwards. At first it does not let\nthe moisture go, for the quantity is small; but as soon as it has\ncollected a considerable amount, it cannot hold it up, on account of the\nweight, but sprinkles it upon the heads of the bathers. In the same way,\nwhen the atmospheric air feels the heat of the sun, it draws the\nmoisture from all about, causes it to rise, and gathers it into clouds.\nFor the earth gives out moisture under the influence of heat just as a\nman's heated body emits sweat.\n5. The winds are witnesses to this fact. Those that are produced and\ncome from the coolest directions, the north and northeast winds, blow in\nblasts that are rarefied by the great dryness in the atmosphere, but the\nsouth wind and the others that assail us from the direction of the sun's\ncourse are very damp, and always bring rain, because they reach us from\nwarm regions after being well heated there, and licking up and carrying\noff the moisture from the whole country, they pour it out on the regions\nin the north.\n6. That this is the state of the case may be proved by the sources of\nrivers, the majority and the longest of which, as drawn and described in\ngeographies of the world, are found to rise in the north. First in\nIndia, the Ganges and Indus spring from the Caucasus; in Syria, the\nTigris and Euphrates; in Pontus in Asia, the Dnieper, Bug, and Don; in\nColchis, the Phasis; in Gaul, the Rhone; in Celtica, the Rhine; on this\nside of the Alps, the Timavo and Po; in Italy, the Tiber; in Maurusia,\nwhich we call Mauretania, the Dyris, rising in the Atlas range and\nrunning westerly to Lake Heptagonus, where it changes its name and is\ncalled Agger; then from Lake Heptabolus it runs at the base of barren\nmountains, flowing southerly and emptying into the marsh called[10]...\nIt surrounds Mero\u00eb, which is a kingdom in southern Ethiopia, and from\nthe marsh grounds there, winding round by the rivers Astansoba and\nAstoboa and a great many others, it passes through the mountains to the\nCataract, and from there it dashes down, and passes to the north between\nElephantis and Syene and the plains of Thebes into Egypt, where it is\ncalled the Nile.\n[Note 10: Here something is lost, as also in chapter III, sections 5\nand 6.]\n7. That the source of the Nile is in Mauretania is known principally\nfrom the fact that there are other springs on the other side of the\nAtlas range flowing into the ocean to the west, and that ichneumons,\ncrocodiles, and other animals and fishes of like nature are found\nthere, although there are no hippopotamuses.\n8. Therefore, since in descriptions of the world it appears that all\nrivers of any size flow from the north, and since in the plains of\nAfrica, which are exposed to the course of the sun in the south, the\nmoisture is deeply hidden, springs not common, and rivers rare, it\nfollows that the sources of springs which lie to the north or northeast\nare much better, unless they hit upon a place which is full of sulphur,\nalum, or asphalt. In this case they are completely changed, and flow in\nsprings which have a bad smell and taste, whether the water is hot or\ncold.\n9. The fact is, heat is not at all a property of water, but when a\nstream of cold water happens upon a hot place, it boils up, and issues\nthrough the fissures and out of the ground in a state of heat. This\ncannot last very long, but in a short time the water becomes cold. If it\nwere naturally hot, it would not cool off and lose its heat. Its taste,\nhowever, and its smell and colour are not restored, because it has\nbecome saturated and compounded with these qualities on account of the\nrarity of its nature.\nCHAPTER III\nVARIOUS PROPERTIES OF DIFFERENT WATERS\n1. There are, however, some hot springs that supply water of the best\ntaste, which is so delightful to drink that one does not think with\nregret of the Fountain of the Muses or the Marcian aqueduct. These hot\nsprings are produced naturally, in the following manner. When fire is\nkindled down beneath in alum or asphalt or sulphur, it makes the earth\nimmediately over it very hot, and emits a glowing heat to the parts\nstill farther above it, so that if there are any springs of sweet water\nfound in the upper strata, they begin to boil in their fissures when\nthey are met by this heat, and so they run out with their taste\nunimpaired.\n2. And there are some cold springs that have a bad smell and taste.\nThey rise deep down in the lower strata, cross places which are on fire,\nand then are cooled by running a long distance through the earth, coming\nout above ground with their taste, smell, and colour spoiled; as, for\ninstance, the river Albula on the road to Tivoli and the cold springs of\nArdea, which have the same smell and are called sulphur springs, and\nothers in similar places. Although they are cold, yet at first sight\nthey seem to be hot for the reason that when they happen upon a burning\nspot deep down below, the liquid and the fire meet, and with a great\nnoise at the collision they take in strong currents of air, and thus,\nswollen by a quantity of compressed wind, they come out at the springs\nin a constant state of ebullition. When such springs are not open but\nconfined by rocks, the force of the air in them drives them up through\nthe narrow fissures to the summits of hills.\n3. Consequently those who think that they have excavated sources of\nsprings at the height of such hills find themselves mistaken when they\nopen up their excavations. Suppose a bronze vase filled not to the very\nlips, but containing two thirds of the quantity of water which forms its\ncapacity, and with a cover placed upon it. When it is subjected to a\nvery hot fire, the water must become thoroughly heated, and from the\nrarity of its nature it greatly expands by taking in the heat, so that\nit not only fills the vase but raises its cover by means of the currents\nof air in it, and swells and runs over. But if you take the cover off,\nthe expanding forces are released into the open air, and the water\nsettles down again to its proper level. So it is with the sources of\nsprings. As long as they are confined in narrow channels, the currents\nof air in the water rush up in bubbles to the top, but as soon as they\nare given a wider outlet, they lose their air on account of the rarity\npeculiar to water, and so settle down and resume their proper level.\n4. Every hot spring has healing properties because it has been boiled\nwith foreign substances, and thus acquires a new useful quality. For\nexample, sulphur springs cure pains in the sinews, by warming up and\nburning out the corrupt humours of the body by their heat. Aluminous\nsprings, used in the treatment of the limbs when enfeebled by paralysis\nor the stroke of any such malady, introduce warmth through the open\npores, counter-acting the chill by the opposite effect of their heat,\nand thus equably restoring the limbs to their former condition.\nAsphaltic springs, taken as purges, cure internal maladies.\n5. There is also a kind of cold water containing natron, found for\ninstance at Penne in the Vestine country, at Cutiliae, and at other\nsimilar places. It is taken as a purge and in passing through the bowels\nreduces scrofulous tumours. Copious springs are found where there are\nmines of gold, silver, iron, copper, lead, and the like, but they are\nvery harmful. For they contain, like hot springs, sulphur, alum,\nasphalt,... and when it passes into the body in the form of drink, and\nspreading through the veins reaches the sinews and joints, it expands\nand hardens them. Hence the sinews, swelling with this expansion, are\ncontracted in length and so give men the cramp or the gout, for the\nreason that their veins are saturated with very hard, dense, and cold\nsubstances.\n6. There is also a sort of water which, since it contains... that are\nnot perfectly clear, and it floats like a flower on the surface, in\ncolour like purple glass. This may be seen particularly in Athens, where\nthere are aqueducts from places and springs of that sort leading to the\ncity and the port of Piraeus, from which nobody drinks, for the reason\nmentioned, but they use them for bathing and so forth, and drink from\nwells, thus avoiding their unwholesomeness. At Troezen it cannot be\navoided, because no other kind of water at all is found, except what the\nCibdeli furnish, and so in that city all or most of the people have\ndiseases of the feet. At the city of Tarsus in Cilicia is a river named\nCydnus, in which gouty people soak their legs and find relief from pain.\n7. There are also many other kinds of water which have peculiar\nproperties; for example, the river Himera in Sicily, which, after\nleaving its source, is divided into two branches. One flows in the\ndirection of Etruria and has an exceedingly sweet taste on account of a\nsweet juice in the soil through which it runs; the other runs through a\ncountry where there are salt pits, and so it has a salt taste. At\nParaetonium, and on the road to Ammon, and at Casius in Egypt there are\nmarshy lakes which are so salt that they have a crust of salt on the\nsurface. In many other places there are springs and rivers and lakes\nwhich are necessarily rendered salt because they run through salt pits.\n8. Others flow through such greasy veins of soil that they are\noverspread with oil when they burst out as springs: for example, at\nSoli, a town in Cilicia, the river named Liparis, in which swimmers or\nbathers get anointed merely by the water. Likewise there is a lake in\nEthiopia which anoints people who swim in it, and one in India which\nemits a great quantity of oil when the sky is clear. At Carthage is a\nspring that has oil swimming on its surface and smelling like sawdust\nfrom citrus wood, with which oil sheep are anointed. In Zacynthus and\nabout Dyrrachium and Apollonia are springs which discharge a great\nquantity of pitch with their water. In Babylon, a lake of very great\nextent, called Lake Asphaltitis, has liquid asphalt swimming on its\nsurface, with which asphalt and with burnt brick Semiramis built the\nwall surrounding Babylon. At Jaffa in Syria and among the Nomads in\nArabia, are lakes of enormous size that yield very large masses of\nasphalt, which are carried off by the inhabitants thereabouts.\n9. There is nothing marvellous in this, for quarries of hard asphalt are\nnumerous there. So, when a quantity of water bursts its way through the\nasphaltic soil, it carries asphalt out with it, and after passing out of\nthe ground, the water is separated and so rejects the asphalt from\nitself. Again, in Cappadocia on the road from Mazaca to Tyana, there is\nan extensive lake into which if a part of a reed or of some other thing\nbe plunged, and withdrawn the next day, it will be found that the part\nthus withdrawn has turned into stone, while the part which remained\nabove water retains its original nature.\n10. In the same way, at Hierapolis in Phrygia there is a multitude of\nboiling hot springs from which water is let into ditches surrounding\ngardens and vineyards, and this water becomes an incrustation of stone\nat the end of a year. Hence, every year they construct banks of earth to\nthe right and left, let in the water, and thus out of these\nincrustations make walls for their fields. This seems due to natural\ncauses, since there is a juice having a coagulating potency like rennet\nunderground in those spots and in that country. When this potency\nappears above ground mingled with spring water, the mixture cannot but\nbe hardened by the heat of the sun and air, as appears in salt pits.\n11. There are also springs which issue exceedingly bitter, owing to a\nbitter juice in the soil, such as the river Hypanis in Pontus. For about\nforty miles from its source its taste is very sweet; then it reaches a\npoint about one hundred and sixty miles from its mouth, where it is\njoined by a very small brook. This runs into it, and at once makes that\nvast river bitter, for the reason that the water of the brook becomes\nbitter by flowing through the kind of soil and the veins in which there\nare sandarach mines.\n12. These waters are given their different flavours by the properties of\nthe soil, as is also seen in the case of fruits. If the roots of trees,\nvines, or other plants did not produce their fruits by drawing juices\nfrom soil of different properties, the flowers of all would be of the\nsame kind in all places and districts. But we find in the island of\nLesbos the protropum wine, in Maeonia, the catacecaumenites, in Lydia,\nthe Tmolian, in Sicily, the Mamertine, in Campania, the Falernian,\nbetween Terracina and Fondi, the Caecuban, and wines of countless\nvarieties and qualities produced in many other places. This could not be\nthe case, were it not that the juice of the soil, introduced with its\nproper flavours into the roots, feeds the stem, and, mounting along it\nto the top, imparts a flavour to the fruit which is peculiar to its\nsituation and kind.\n13. If soils were not different and unlike in their kinds of juices,\nSyria and Arabia would not be the only places in which the reeds,\nrushes, and all the plants are aromatic, and in which there are trees\nbearing frankincense or yielding pepper berries and lumps of myrrh, nor\nwould assafoetida be found only in the stalks growing in Cyrene, but\neverything would be of the same sort, and produced in the soil of all\ncountries. It is the inclination of the firmament and the force of the\nsun, as it draws nearer or recedes in its course, that make these\ndiversities such as we find them in different countries and places,\nthrough the nature of the soil and it's juices. And not only in the case\nof the things mentioned, but also in that of sheep and cattle. These\ndiversities would not exist if the different properties of soils and\ntheir juices were not qualified by the power of the sun.\n14. For instance, there are in Boeotia the rivers Cephisus and Melas, in\nLucania, the Crathis, in Troy, the Xanthus, and certain springs in the\ncountry of the Clazomenians, the Erythraeans, and the Laodiceans. When\nsheep are ready for breeding at the proper season of the year, they are\ndriven every day during that season to those rivers to drink, and the\nresult is that, however white they may be, they beget in some places\nwhity-brown lambs, in other places gray, and in others black as a raven.\nThus, the peculiar character of the liquid, entering their body,\nproduces in each case the quality with which it is imbued. Hence, it is\nsaid that the people of Ilium gave the river Xanthus its name because\nreddish cattle and whity-brown sheep are found in the plains of Troy\nnear that river.\n15. Deadly kinds of water are also found, which run through soil\ncontaining a noxious juice, and take in its poisonous quality: for\ninstance, there is said to have been a spring at Terracina, called the\nspring of Neptune, which caused the death of those who thoughtlessly\ndrank from it. In consequence, it is said that the ancients stopped it\nup. At Chrobs in Thrace there is a lake which causes the death not only\nof those who drink of it, but also of those who bathe in it. In Thessaly\nthere is a gushing fount of which sheep never taste, nor does any sort\nof creature draw near to it, and close by this fount there is a tree\nwith crimson flowers.\n16. In Macedonia, at the place where Euripides is buried, two streams\napproach from the right and left of his tomb, and unite. By one of\nthese, travellers are in the habit of lying down and taking luncheon,\nbecause its water is good; but nobody goes near the stream on the other\nside of the tomb, because its water is said to be death-dealing. In\nArcadia there is a tract of land called Nonacris, which has extremely\ncold water trickling from a rock in the mountains. This water is called\n\"Water of the Styx,\" and no vessel, whether of silver, bronze, or iron,\ncan stand it without flying to pieces and breaking up. Nothing but a\nmule's hoof can keep it together and hold it, and tradition says that it\nwas thus conveyed by Antipater through his son Iollas into the province\nwhere Alexander was staying, and that the king was killed by him with\nthis water.\n17. Among the Alps in the kingdom of Cottius there is a water those who\ntaste of which immediately fall lifeless. In the Faliscan country on the\nVia Campana in the Campus Cornetus is a grove in which rises a spring,\nand there the bones of birds and of lizards and other reptiles are seen\nlying.\nSome springs are acid, as at Lyncestus and in Italy in the Velian\ncountry, at Teano in Campania, and in many other places. These when used\nas drinks have the power of breaking up stones in the bladder, which\nform in the human body.\n18. This seems to be due to natural causes, as there is a sharp and acid\njuice contained in the soil there, which imparts a sharpness to these\nsprings as they issue from it; and so, on entering the body, they\ndisperse all the deposits and concretions, due to the use of other\nwaters, which they find in the body. Why such things are broken up by\nacid waters we can see from the following experiments. If an egg is left\nfor some time in vinegar, its shell will soften and dissolve. Again, if\na piece of lead, which is very flexible and heavy, is put in a vase and\nvinegar poured over it, and the vase covered and sealed up, the lead\nwill be dissolved and turn into white lead.\n19. On the same principle, copper, which is naturally more solid, will\ndisperse and turn into verdigris if similarly treated. So, also, a\npearl. Even rocks of lava, which neither iron nor fire alone can\ndissolve, split into pieces and dissolve when heated with fire and then\nsprinkled with vinegar. Hence, since we see these things taking place\nbefore our very eyes, we can infer that on the same principle even\npatients with the stone may, in the nature of things, be cured in like\nmanner by means of acid waters, on account of the sharpness of the\npotion.\n20. Then there are springs in which wine seems to be mingled, like the\none in Paphlagonia, the water of which intoxicates those who drink of\nthe spring alone without wine. The Aequians in Italy and the tribe of\nthe Medulli in the Alps have a kind of water which causes swellings in\nthe throats of those who drink it.\n21. In Arcadia is the well-known town of Clitor, in whose territory is a\ncave with running water which makes people who drink of it abstemious.\nAt this spring, there is an epigram in Greek verses inscribed on stone\nto the effect that the water is unsuitable for bathing, and also\ninjurious to vines, because it was at this spring that Melampus cleansed\nthe daughters of Proetus of their madness by sacrificial rites, and\nrestored those maidens to their former sound state of mind. The\ninscription runs as written below:\nSwain, if by noontide thirst thou art opprest\nWhen with thy flocks to Cleitor's bounds thou'st hied,\nTake from this fount a draught, and grant a rest\nTo all thy goats the water nymphs beside.\nBut bathe not in't when full of drunken cheer,\nLest the mere vapour may bring thee to bane;\nShun my vine-hating spring--Melampus here\nFrom madness once washed Proetus' daughters sane,\nAnd all th' offscouring here did hide, when they\nFrom Argos came to rugged Arcady.\n22. In the island of Zea is a spring of which those who thoughtlessly\ndrink lose their understanding, and an epigram is cut there to the\neffect that a draught from the spring is delightful, but that he who\ndrinks will become dull as a stone. These are the verses:\nThis stone sweet streams of cooling drink doth drip,\nBut stone his wits become who doth it sip.\n23. At Susa, the capital of the Persian kingdom, there is a little\nspring, those who drink of which lose their teeth. An epigram is written\nthere, the significance of which is to this effect, that the water is\nexcellent for bathing, but that taken as drink, it knocks out the teeth\nby the roots. The verses of this epigram are, in Greek, as follows:\nStranger, you see the waters of a spring\nIn which 'tis safe for men their hands to lave;\nBut if the weedy basin entering\nYou drink of its unpalatable wave,\nYour grinders tumble out that self-same day\nFrom jaws that orphaned sockets will display.\n24. There are also in some places springs which have the peculiarity of\ngiving fine singing voices to the natives, as at Tarsus in Magnesia and\nin other countries of that kind. Then there is Zama, an African city,\nwhich King Juba fortified by enclosing it with a double wall, and he\nestablished his royal residence there. Twenty miles from it is the\nwalled town of Ismuc, the lands belonging to which are marked off by a\nmarvellous kind of boundary. For although Africa was the mother and\nnurse of wild animals, particularly serpents, yet not one is ever born\nin the lands of that town, and if ever one is imported and put there, it\ndies at once; and not only this, but if soil is taken from this spot to\nanother place, the same is true there. It is said that this kind of soil\nis also found in the Balearic Islands. The above mentioned soil has a\nstill more wonderful property, of which I have learned in the following\nway.\n25. Caius Julius, Masinissa's son, who owned all the lands about that\ntown, served with Caesar the father. He was once my guest. Hence, in our\ndaily intercourse, we naturally talked of literary subjects. During a\nconversation between us on the efficacy of water and its qualities, he\nstated that there were springs in that country of a kind which caused\npeople born there to have fine singing voices, and that consequently\nthey always sent abroad and bought handsome lads and ripe girls, and\nmated them, so that their progeny might have not only fine voices but\nalso beautiful forms.\n26. This great variety in different things is a distribution due to\nnature, for even the human body, which consists in part of the earthy,\ncontains many kinds of juices, such as blood, milk, sweat, urine, and\ntears. If all this variation of flavours is found in a small portion of\nthe earthy, we should not be surprised to find in the great earth itself\ncountless varieties of juices, through the veins of which the water\nruns, and becomes saturated with them before reaching the outlets of\nsprings. In this way, different varieties of springs of peculiar kinds\nare produced, on account of diversity of situation, characteristics of\ncountry, and dissimilar properties of soils.\n27. Some of these things I have seen for myself, others I have found\nwritten in Greek books, the authorities for these writings being\nTheophrastus, Timaeus, Posidonius, Hegesias, Herodotus, Aristides, and\nMetrodorus. These men with much attention and endless pains showed by\ntheir writings that the peculiarities of sites, the properties of\nwaters, and the characteristics of countries are conditioned by the\ninclination of the heaven. Following their investigations, I have set\ndown in this book what I thought sufficient about different kinds of\nwater, to make it easier, by means of these directions, for people to\npick out springs from which they can conduct the water in aqueducts for\nthe use of cities and towns.\n28. For it is obvious that nothing in the world is so necessary for use\nas water, seeing that any living creature can, if deprived of grain or\nfruit or meat or fish, or any one of them, support life by using other\nfoodstuffs; but without water no animal nor any proper food can be\nproduced, kept in good condition, or prepared. Consequently we must\ntake great care and pains in searching for springs and selecting them,\nkeeping in view the health of mankind.\nCHAPTER IV\nTESTS OF GOOD WATER\n1. Springs should be tested and proved in advance in the following ways.\nIf they run free and open, inspect and observe the physique of the\npeople who dwell in the vicinity before beginning to conduct the water,\nand if their frames are strong, their complexions fresh, legs sound, and\neyes clear, the springs deserve complete approval. If it is a spring\njust dug out, its water is excellent if it can be sprinkled into a\nCorinthian vase or into any other sort made of good bronze without\nleaving a spot on it. Again, if such water is boiled in a bronze\ncauldron, afterwards left for a time, and then poured off without sand\nor mud being found at the bottom of the cauldron, that water also will\nhave proved its excellence.\n2. And if green vegetables cook quickly when put into a vessel of such\nwater and set over a fire, it will be a proof that the water is good and\nwholesome. Likewise if the water in the spring is itself limpid and\nclear, if there is no growth of moss or reeds where it spreads and\nflows, and if its bed is not polluted by filth of any sort but has a\nclean appearance, these signs indicate that the water is light and\nwholesome in the highest degree.\nCHAPTER V\nLEVELLING AND LEVELLING INSTRUMENTS\n1. I shall now treat of the ways in which water should be conducted to\ndwellings and cities. First comes the method of taking the level.\nLevelling is done either with dioptrae, or with water levels, or with\nthe chorobates, but it is done with greater accuracy by means of the\nchorobates, because dioptrae and levels are deceptive. The chorobates is\na straightedge about twenty feet long. At the extremities it has legs,\nmade exactly alike and jointed on perpendicularly to the extremities of\nthe straightedge, and also crosspieces, fastened by tenons, connecting\nthe straightedge and the legs. These crosspieces have vertical lines\ndrawn upon them, and there are plumblines hanging from the straightedge\nover each of the lines. When the straightedge is in position, and the\nplumblines strike both the lines alike and at the same time, they show\nthat the instrument stands level.\n2. But if the wind interposes, and constant motion prevents any definite\nindication by the lines, then have a groove on the upper side, five feet\nlong, one digit wide, and a digit and a half deep, and pour water into\nit. If the water comes up uniformly to the rims of the groove, it will\nbe known that the instrument is level. When the level is thus found by\nmeans of the chorobates, the amount of fall will also be known.\n3. Perhaps some reader of the works of Archimedes will say that there\ncan be no true levelling by means of water, because he holds that water\nhas not a level surface, but is of a spherical form, having its centre\nat the centre of the earth. Still, whether water is plane or spherical,\nit necessarily follows that when the straightedge is level, it will\nsupport the water evenly at its extremities on the right and left, but\nthat if it slopes down at one end, the water at the higher end will not\nreach the rim of the groove in the straightedge. For though the water,\nwherever poured in, must have a swelling and curvature in the centre,\nyet the extremities on the right and left must be on a level with each\nother. A picture of the chorobates will be found drawn at the end of the\nbook. If there is to be a considerable fall, the conducting of the water\nwill be comparatively easy. But if the course is broken by depressions,\nwe must have recourse to substructures.\nCHAPTER VI\nAQUEDUCTS, WELLS, AND CISTERNS\n1. There are three methods of conducting water, in channels through\nmasonry conduits, or in lead pipes, or in pipes of baked clay. If in\nconduits, let the masonry be as solid as possible, and let the bed of\nthe channel have a gradient of not less than a quarter of an inch for\nevery hundred feet, and let the masonry structure be arched over, so\nthat the sun may not strike the water at all. When it has reached the\ncity, build a reservoir with a distribution tank in three compartments\nconnected with the reservoir to receive the water, and let the reservoir\nhave three pipes, one for each of the connecting tanks, so that when the\nwater runs over from the tanks at the ends, it may run into the one\nbetween them.\n2. From this central tank, pipes will be laid to all the basins and\nfountains; from the second tank, to baths, so that they may yield an\nannual income to the state; and from the third, to private houses, so\nthat water for public use will not run short; for people will be unable\nto divert it if they have only their own supplies from headquarters.\nThis is the reason why I have made these divisions, and also in order\nthat individuals who take water into their houses may by their taxes\nhelp to maintain the conducting of the water by the contractors.\n3. If, however, there are hills between the city and the source of\nsupply, subterranean channels must be dug, and brought to a level at the\ngradient mentioned above. If the bed is of tufa or other stone, let the\nchannel be cut in it; but if it is of earth or sand, there must be\nvaulted masonry walls for the channel, and the water should thus be\nconducted, with shafts built at every two hundred and forty feet.\n4. But if the water is to be conducted in lead pipes, first build a\nreservoir at the source; then, let the pipes have an interior area\ncorresponding to the amount of water, and lay these pipes from this\nreservoir to the reservoir which is inside the city walls. The pipes\nshould be cast in lengths of at least ten feet. If they are hundreds,\nthey should weigh 1200 pounds each length; if eighties, 960 pounds; if\nfifties, 600 pounds; forties, 480 pounds; thirties, 360 pounds;\ntwenties, 240 pounds; fifteens, 180 pounds; tens, 120 pounds; eights,\n100 pounds; fives, 60 pounds. The pipes get the names of their sizes\nfrom the width of the plates, taken in digits, before they are rolled\ninto tubes. Thus, when a pipe is made from a plate fifty digits in\nwidth, it will be called a \"fifty,\" and so on with the rest.\n5. The conducting of the water through lead pipes is to be managed as\nfollows. If there is a regular fall from the source to the city, without\nany intervening hills that are high enough to interrupt it, but with\ndepressions in it, then we must build substructures to bring it up to\nthe level as in the case of channels and conduits. If the distance round\nsuch depressions is not great, the water may be carried round\ncircuitously; but if the valleys are extensive, the course will be\ndirected down their slope. On reaching the bottom, a low substructure is\nbuilt so that the level there may continue as long as possible. This\nwill form the \"venter,\" termed [Greek: Koilia] by the Greeks. Then, on\nreaching the hill on the opposite side, the length of the venter makes\nthe water slow in swelling up to rise to the top of the hill.\n6. But if there is no such venter made in the valleys, nor any\nsubstructure built on a level, but merely an elbow, the water will break\nout, and burst the joints of the pipes. And in the venter, water\ncushions must be constructed to relieve the pressure of the air. Thus,\nthose who have to conduct water through lead pipes will do it most\nsuccessfully on these principles, because its descents, circuits,\nventers, and risings can be managed in this way, when the level of the\nfall from the sources to the city is once obtained.\n7. It is also not ineffectual to build reservoirs at intervals of 24,000\nfeet, so that if a break occurs anywhere, it will not completely ruin\nthe whole work, and the place where it has occurred can easily be\nfound; but such reservoirs should not be built at a descent, nor in the\nplane of a venter, nor at risings, nor anywhere in valleys, but only\nwhere there is an unbroken level.\n8. But if we wish to spend less money, we must proceed as follows. Clay\npipes with a skin at least two digits thick should be made, but these\npipes should be tongued at one end so that they can fit into and join\none another. Their joints must be coated with quicklime mixed with oil,\nand at the angles of the level of the venter a piece of red tufa stone,\nwith a hole bored through it, must be placed right at the elbow, so that\nthe last length of pipe used in the descent is jointed into the stone,\nand also the first length of the level of the venter; similarly at the\nhill on the opposite side the last length of the level of the venter\nshould stick into the hole in the red tufa, and the first of the rise\nshould be similarly jointed into it.\n9. The level of the pipes being thus adjusted, they will not be sprung\nout of place by the force generated at the descent and at the rising.\nFor a strong current of air is generated in an aqueduct which bursts its\nway even through stones unless the water is let in slowly and sparingly\nfrom the source at first, and checked at the elbows or turns by bands,\nor by the weight of sand ballast. All the other arrangements should be\nmade as in the case of lead pipes. And ashes are to be put in beforehand\nwhen the water is let in from the source for the first time, so that if\nany of the joints have not been sufficiently coated, they may be coated\nwith ashes.\n10. Clay pipes for conducting water have the following advantages. In\nthe first place, in construction:--if anything happens to them, anybody\ncan repair the damage. Secondly, water from clay pipes is much more\nwholesome than that which is conducted through lead pipes, because lead\nis found to be harmful for the reason that white lead is derived from\nit, and this is said to be hurtful to the human system. Hence, if what\nis produced from it is harmful, no doubt the thing itself is not\nwholesome.\n11. This we can exemplify from plumbers, since in them the natural\ncolour of the body is replaced by a deep pallor. For when lead is\nsmelted in casting, the fumes from it settle upon their members, and day\nafter day burn out and take away all the virtues of the blood from their\nlimbs. Hence, water ought by no means to be conducted in lead pipes, if\nwe want to have it wholesome. That the taste is better when it comes\nfrom clay pipes may be proved by everyday life, for though our tables\nare loaded with silver vessels, yet everybody uses earthenware for the\nsake of purity of taste.\n12. But if there are no springs from which we can construct aqueducts,\nit is necessary to dig wells. Now in the digging of wells we must not\ndisdain reflection, but must devote much acuteness and skill to the\nconsideration of the natural principles of things, because the earth\ncontains many various substances in itself; for like everything else, it\nis composed of the four elements. In the first place, it is itself\nearthy, and of moisture it contains springs of water, also heat, which\nproduces sulphur, alum, and asphalt; and finally, it contains great\ncurrents of air, which, coming up in a pregnant state through the porous\nfissures to the places where wells are being dug, and finding men\nengaged in digging there, stop up the breath of life in their nostrils\nby the natural strength of the exhalation. So those who do not quickly\nescape from the spot, are killed there.\n13. To guard against this, we must proceed as follows. Let down a\nlighted lamp, and if it keeps on burning, a man may make the descent\nwithout danger. But if the light is put out by the strength of the\nexhalation, then dig air shafts beside the well on the right and left.\nThus the vapours will be carried off by the air shafts as if through\nnostrils. When these are finished and we come to the water, then a wall\nshould be built round the well without stopping up the vein.\n14. But if the ground is hard, or if the veins lie too deep, the water\nsupply must be obtained from roofs or higher ground, and collected in\ncisterns of \"signinum work.\" Signinum work is made as follows. In the\nfirst place, procure the cleanest and sharpest sand, break up lava into\nbits of not more than a pound in weight, and mix the sand in a mortar\ntrough with the strongest lime in the proportion of five parts of sand\nto two of lime. The trench for the signinum work, down to the level of\nthe proposed depth of the cistern, should be beaten with wooden beetles\ncovered with iron.\n15. Then after having beaten the walls, let all the earth between them\nbe cleared out to a level with the very bottom of the walls. Having\nevened this off, let the ground be beaten to the proper density. If such\nconstructions are in two compartments or in three so as to insure\nclearing by changing from one to another, they will make the water much\nmore wholesome and sweeter to use. For it will become more limpid, and\nkeep its taste without any smell, if the mud has somewhere to settle;\notherwise it will be necessary to clear it by adding salt.\nIn this book I have put what I could about the merits and varieties of\nwater, its usefulness, and the ways in which it should be conducted and\ntested; in the next I shall write about the subject of dialling and the\nprinciples of timepieces.\nBOOK IX\nINTRODUCTION\n1. The ancestors of the Greeks have appointed such great honours for the\nfamous athletes who are victorious at the Olympian, Pythian, Isthmian,\nand Nemean games, that they are not only greeted with applause as they\nstand with palm and crown at the meeting itself, but even on returning\nto their several states in the triumph of victory, they ride into their\ncities and to their fathers' houses in four-horse chariots, and enjoy\nfixed revenues for life at the public expense. When I think of this, I\nam amazed that the same honours and even greater are not bestowed upon\nthose authors whose boundless services are performed for all time and\nfor all nations. This would have been a practice all the more worth\nestablishing, because in the case of athletes it is merely their own\nbodily frame that is strengthened by their training, whereas in the case\nof authors it is the mind, and not only their own but also man's in\ngeneral, by the doctrines laid down in their books for the acquiring of\nknowledge and the sharpening of the intellect.\n2. What does it signify to mankind that Milo of Croton and other victors\nof his class were invincible? Nothing, save that in their lifetime they\nwere famous among their countrymen. But the doctrines of Pythagoras,\nDemocritus, Plato, and Aristotle, and the daily life of other learned\nmen, spent in constant industry, yield fresh and rich fruit, not only to\ntheir own countrymen, but also to all nations. And they who from their\ntender years are filled with the plenteous learning which this fruit\naffords, attain to the highest capacity of knowledge, and can introduce\ninto their states civilized ways, impartial justice, and laws, things\nwithout which no state can be sound.\n3. Since, therefore, these great benefits to individuals and to\ncommunities are due to the wisdom of authors, I think that not only\nshould palms and crowns be bestowed upon them, but that they should even\nbe granted triumphs, and judged worthy of being consecrated in the\ndwellings of the gods.\nOf their many discoveries which have been useful for the development of\nhuman life, I will cite a few examples. On reviewing these, people will\nadmit that honours ought of necessity to be bestowed upon them.\n4. First of all, among the many very useful theorems of Plato, I will\ncite one as demonstrated by him. Suppose there is a place or a field in\nthe form of a square and we are required to double it. This has to be\neffected by means of lines correctly drawn, for it will take a kind of\ncalculation not to be made by means of mere multiplication. The\nfollowing is the demonstration. A square place ten feet long and ten\nfeet wide gives an area of one hundred feet. Now if it is required to\ndouble the square, and to make one of two hundred feet, we must ask how\nlong will be the side of that square so as to get from this the two\nhundred feet corresponding to the doubling of the area. Nobody can find\nthis by means of arithmetic. For if we take fourteen, multiplication\nwill give one hundred and ninety-six feet; if fifteen, two hundred and\ntwenty-five feet.\n5. Therefore, since this is inexplicable by arithmetic, let a diagonal\nline be drawn from angle to angle of that square of ten feet in length\nand width, dividing it into two triangles of equal size, each fifty feet\nin area. Taking this diagonal line as the length, describe another\nsquare. Thus we shall have in the larger square four triangles of the\nsame size and the same number of feet as the two of fifty feet each\nwhich were formed by the diagonal line in the smaller square. In this\nway Plato demonstrated the doubling by means of lines, as the figure\nappended at the bottom of the page will show.\n6. Then again, Pythagoras showed that a right angle can be formed\nwithout the contrivances of the artisan. Thus, the result which\ncarpenters reach very laboriously, but scarcely to exactness, with their\nsquares, can be demonstrated to perfection from the reasoning and\nmethods of his teaching. If we take three rules, one three feet, the\nsecond four feet, and the third five feet in length, and join these\nrules together with their tips touching each other so as to make a\ntriangular figure, they will form a right angle. Now if a square be\ndescribed on the length of each one of these rules, the square on the\nside of three feet in length will have an area of nine feet; of four\nfeet, sixteen; of five, twenty-five.\n7. Thus the area in number of feet made up of the two squares on the\nsides three and four feet in length is equalled by that of the one\nsquare described on the side of five. When Pythagoras discovered this\nfact, he had no doubt that the Muses had guided him in the discovery,\nand it is said that he very gratefully offered sacrifice to them.\nThis theorem affords a useful means of measuring many things, and it is\nparticularly serviceable in the building of staircases in buildings, so\nthat the steps may be at the proper levels.\n8. Suppose the height of the story, from the flooring above to the\nground below, to be divided into three parts. Five of these will give\nthe right length for the stringers of the stairway. Let four parts, each\nequal to one of the three composing the height between the upper story\nand the ground, be set off from the perpendicular, and there fix the\nlower ends of the stringers. In this manner the steps and the stairway\nitself will be properly placed. A figure of this also will be found\nappended below.\n9. In the case of Archimedes, although he made many wonderful\ndiscoveries of diverse kinds, yet of them all, the following, which I\nshall relate, seems to have been the result of a boundless ingenuity.\nHiero, after gaining the royal power in Syracuse, resolved, as a\nconsequence of his successful exploits, to place in a certain temple a\ngolden crown which he had vowed to the immortal gods. He contracted for\nits making at a fixed price, and weighed out a precise amount of gold to\nthe contractor. At the appointed time the latter delivered to the king's\nsatisfaction an exquisitely finished piece of handiwork, and it appeared\nthat in weight the crown corresponded precisely to what the gold had\nweighed.\n10. But afterwards a charge was made that gold had been abstracted and\nan equivalent weight of silver had been added in the manufacture of the\ncrown. Hiero, thinking it an outrage that he had been tricked, and yet\nnot knowing how to detect the theft, requested Archimedes to consider\nthe matter. The latter, while the case was still on his mind, happened\nto go to the bath, and on getting into a tub observed that the more his\nbody sank into it the more water ran out over the tub. As this pointed\nout the way to explain the case in question, without a moment's delay,\nand transported with joy, he jumped out of the tub and rushed home\nnaked, crying with a loud voice that he had found what he was seeking;\nfor as he ran he shouted repeatedly in Greek, \"[Greek: Eur\u00eaka, eur\u00eaka].\"\n11. Taking this as the beginning of his discovery, it is said that he\nmade two masses of the same weight as the crown, one of gold and the\nother of silver. After making them, he filled a large vessel with water\nto the very brim, and dropped the mass of silver into it. As much water\nran out as was equal in bulk to that of the silver sunk in the vessel.\nThen, taking out the mass, he poured back the lost quantity of water,\nusing a pint measure, until it was level with the brim as it had been\nbefore. Thus he found the weight of silver corresponding to a definite\nquantity of water.\n12. After this experiment, he likewise dropped the mass of gold into the\nfull vessel and, on taking it out and measuring as before, found that\nnot so much water was lost, but a smaller quantity: namely, as much less\nas a mass of gold lacks in bulk compared to a mass of silver of the same\nweight. Finally, filling the vessel again and dropping the crown itself\ninto the same quantity of water, he found that more water ran over for\nthe crown than for the mass of gold of the same weight. Hence, reasoning\nfrom the fact that more water was lost in the case of the crown than in\nthat of the mass, he detected the mixing of silver with the gold, and\nmade the theft of the contractor perfectly clear.\n13. Now let us turn our thoughts to the researches of Archytas of\nTarentum and Eratosthenes of Cyrene. They made many discoveries from\nmathematics which are welcome to men, and so, though they deserve our\nthanks for other discoveries, they are particularly worthy of admiration\nfor their ideas in that field. For example, each in a different way\nsolved the problem enjoined upon Delos by Apollo in an oracle, the\ndoubling of the number of cubic feet in his altars; this done, he said,\nthe inhabitants of the island would be delivered from an offence against\nreligion.\n14. Archytas solved it by his figure of the semi-cylinders;\nEratosthenes, by means of the instrument called the mesolabe.\nNoting all these things with the great delight which learning gives, we\ncannot but be stirred by these discoveries when we reflect upon the\ninfluence of them one by one. I find also much for admiration in the\nbooks of Democritus on nature, and in his commentary entitled [Greek:\nCheirokm\u00eata], in which he made use of his ring to seal with soft wax the\nprinciples which he had himself put to the test.\n15. These, then, were men whose researches are an everlasting\npossession, not only for the improvement of character but also for\ngeneral utility. The fame of athletes, however, soon declines with their\nbodily powers. Neither when they are in the flower of their strength,\nnor afterwards with posterity, can they do for human life what is done\nby the researches of the learned.\n16. But although honours are not bestowed upon authors for excellence of\ncharacter and teaching, yet as their minds, naturally looking up to the\nhigher regions of the air, are raised to the sky on the steps of\nhistory, it must needs be, that not merely their doctrines, but even\ntheir appearance, should be known to posterity through time eternal.\nHence, men whose souls are aroused by the delights of literature cannot\nbut carry enshrined in their hearts the likeness of the poet Ennius, as\nthey do those of the gods. Those who are devotedly attached to the poems\nof Accius seem to have before them not merely his vigorous language but\neven his very figure.\n17. So, too, numbers born after our time will feel as if they were\ndiscussing nature face to face with Lucretius, or the art of rhetoric\nwith Cicero; many of our posterity will confer with Varro on the Latin\nlanguage; likewise, there will be numerous scholars who, as they weigh\nmany points with the wise among the Greeks, will feel as if they were\ncarrying on private conversations with them. In a word, the opinions of\nlearned authors, though their bodily forms are absent, gain strength as\ntime goes on, and, when taking part in councils and discussions, have\ngreater weight than those of any living men.\n18. Such, Caesar, are the authorities on whom I have depended, and\napplying their views and opinions I have written the present books, in\nthe first seven treating of buildings and in the eighth of water. In\nthis I shall set forth the rules for dialling, showing how they are\nfound through the shadows cast by the gnomon from the sun's rays in the\nfirmament, and on what principles these shadows lengthen and shorten.\nCHAPTER I\nTHE ZODIAC AND THE PLANETS\n1. It is due to the divine intelligence and is a very great wonder to\nall who reflect upon it, that the shadow of a gnomon at the equinox is\nof one length in Athens, of another in Alexandria, of another in Rome,\nand not the same at Piacenza, or at other places in the world. Hence\ndrawings for dials are very different from one another, corresponding to\ndifferences of situation. This is because the length of the shadow at\nthe equinox is used in constructing the figure of the analemma, in\naccordance with which the hours are marked to conform to the situation\nand the shadow of the gnomon. The analemma is a basis for calculation\ndeduced from the course of the sun, and found by observation of the\nshadow as it increases until the winter solstice. By means of this,\nthrough architectural principles and the employment of the compasses, we\nfind out the operation of the sun in the universe.\n2. The word \"universe\" means the general assemblage of all nature, and\nit also means the heaven that is made up of the constellations and the\ncourses of the stars. The heaven revolves steadily round earth and sea\non the pivots at the ends of its axis. The architect at these points was\nthe power of Nature, and she put the pivots there, to be, as it were,\ncentres, one of them above the earth and sea at the very top of the\nfirmament and even beyond the stars composing the Great Bear, the other\non the opposite side under the earth in the regions of the south. Round\nthese pivots (termed in Greek [Greek: poloi]) as centres, like those of\na turning lathe, she formed the circles in which the heaven passes on\nits everlasting way. In the midst thereof, the earth and sea naturally\noccupy the central point.\n3. It follows from this natural arrangement that the central point in\nthe north is high above the earth, while on the south, the region\nbelow, it is beneath the earth and consequently hidden by it.\nFurthermore, across the middle, and obliquely inclined to the south,\nthere is a broad circular belt composed of the twelve signs, whose\nstars, arranged in twelve equivalent divisions, represent each a shape\nwhich nature has depicted. And so with the firmament and the other\nconstellations, they move round the earth and sea in glittering array,\ncompleting their orbits according to the spherical shape of the heaven.\n4. They are all visible or invisible according to fixed times. While six\nof the signs are passing along with the heaven above the earth, the\nother six are moving under the earth and hidden by its shadow. But there\nare always six of them making their way above the earth; for,\ncorresponding to that part of the last sign which in the course of its\nrevolution has to sink, pass under the earth, and become concealed, an\nequivalent part of the sign opposite to it is obliged by the law of\ntheir common revolution to pass up and, having completed its circuit, to\nemerge out of the darkness into the light of the open space on the other\nside. This is because the rising and setting of both are subject to one\nand the same power and law.\n5. While these signs, twelve in number and occupying each one twelfth\npart of the firmament, steadily revolve from east to west, the moon,\nMercury, Venus, the sun, as well as Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn, differing\nfrom one another in the magnitude of their orbits as though their\ncourses were at different points in a flight of steps, pass through\nthose signs in just the opposite direction, from west to east in the\nfirmament. The moon makes her circuit of the heaven in twenty-eight days\nplus about an hour, and with her return to the sign from which she set\nforth, completes a lunar month.\n6. The sun takes a full month to move across the space of one sign, that\nis, one twelfth of the firmament. Consequently, in twelve months he\ntraverses the spaces of the twelve signs, and, on returning to the sign\nfrom which he began, completes the period of a full year. Hence, the\ncircuit made by the moon thirteen times in twelve months, is measured\nby the sun only once in the same number of months. But Mercury and\nVenus, their paths wreathing around the sun's rays as their centre,\nretrograde and delay their movements, and so, from the nature of that\ncircuit, sometimes wait at stopping-places within the spaces of the\nsigns.\n7. This fact may best be recognized from Venus. When she is following\nthe sun, she makes her appearance in the sky after his setting, and is\nthen called the Evening Star, shining most brilliantly. At other times\nshe precedes him, rising before day-break, and is named the Morning\nStar. Thus Mercury and Venus sometimes delay in one sign for a good many\ndays, and at others advance pretty rapidly into another sign. They do\nnot spend the same number of days in every sign, but the longer they\nhave previously delayed, the more rapidly they accomplish their journeys\nafter passing into the next sign, and thus they complete their appointed\ncourse. Consequently, in spite of their delay in some of the signs, they\nnevertheless soon reach the proper place in their orbits after freeing\nthemselves from their enforced delay.\n8. Mercury, on his journey through the heavens, passes through the\nspaces of the signs in three hundred and sixty days, and so arrives at\nthe sign from which he set out on his course at the beginning of his\nrevolution. His average rate of movement is such that he has about\nthirty days in each sign.\n9. Venus, on becoming free from the hindrance of the sun's rays, crosses\nthe space of a sign in thirty days. Though she thus stays less than\nforty days in particular signs, she makes good the required amount by\ndelaying in one sign when she comes to a pause. Therefore she completes\nher total revolution in heaven in four hundred and eighty-five days, and\nonce more enters the sign from which she previously began to move.\n10. Mars, after traversing the spaces of the constellations for about\nsix hundred and eighty-three days, arrives at the point from which he\nhad before set out at the beginning of his course, and while he passes\nthrough some of the signs more rapidly than others, he makes up the\nrequired number of days whenever he comes to a pause. Jupiter, climbing\nwith gentler pace against the revolution of the firmament, travels\nthrough each sign in about three hundred and sixty days, and finishes in\neleven years and three hundred and thirteen days, returning to the sign\nin which he had been twelve years before. Saturn, traversing the space\nof one sign in twenty-nine months plus a few days, is restored after\ntwenty-nine years and about one hundred and sixty days to that in which\nhe had been thirty years before. He is, as it appears, slower, because\nthe nearer he is to the outermost part of the firmament, the greater is\nthe orbit through which he has to pass.\n11. The three that complete their circuits above the sun's course do not\nmake progress while they are in the triangle which he has entered, but\nretrograde and pause until the sun has crossed from that triangle into\nanother sign. Some hold that this takes place because, as they say, when\nthe sun is a great distance off, the paths on which these stars wander\nare without light on account of that distance, and so the darkness\nretards and hinders them. But I do not think that this is so. The\nsplendour of the sun is clearly to be seen, and manifest without any\nkind of obscurity, throughout the whole firmament, so that those very\nretrograde movements and pauses of the stars are visible even to us.\n12. If then, at this great distance, our human vision can discern that\nsight, why, pray, are we to think that the divine splendour of the stars\ncan be cast into darkness? Rather will the following way of accounting\nfor it prove to be correct. Heat summons and attracts everything towards\nitself; for instance, we see the fruits of the earth growing up high\nunder the influence of heat, and that spring water is vapourised and\ndrawn up to the clouds at sunrise. On the same principle, the mighty\ninfluence of the sun, with his rays diverging in the form of a triangle,\nattracts the stars which follow him, and, as it were, curbs and\nrestrains those that precede, not allowing them to make progress, but\nobliging them to retrograde towards himself until he passes out into\nthe sign that belongs to a different triangle.\n13. Perhaps the question will be raised, why the sun by his great heat\ncauses these detentions in the fifth sign from himself rather than in\nthe second or third, which are nearer. I will therefore set forth what\nseems to be the reason. His rays diverge through the firmament in\nstraight lines as though forming an equilateral triangle, that is, to\nthe fifth sign from the sun, no more, no less. If his rays were diffused\nin circuits spreading all over the firmament, instead of in straight\nlines diverging so as to form a triangle, they would burn up all the\nnearer objects. This is a fact which the Greek poet Euripides seems to\nhave remarked; for he says that places at a greater distance from the\nsun are in a violent heat, and that those which are nearer he keeps\ntemperate. Thus in the play of Phaethon, the poet writes: [Greek: kaiei\nta porr\u00f4, tangythen d eukrat echei].\n14. If then, fact and reason and the evidence of an ancient poet point\nto this explanation, I do not see why we should decide otherwise than as\nI have written above on this subject.\nJupiter, whose orbit is between those of Mars and Saturn, traverses a\nlonger course than Mars, and a shorter than Saturn. Likewise with the\nrest of these stars: the farther they are from the outermost limits of\nthe heaven, and the nearer their orbits to the earth, the sooner they\nare seen to finish their courses; for those of them that have a smaller\norbit often pass those that are higher, going under them.\n15. For example, place seven ants on a wheel such as potters use, having\nmade seven channels on the wheel about the centre, increasing\nsuccessively in circumference; and suppose those ants obliged to make a\ncircuit in these channels while the wheel is turned in the opposite\ndirection. In spite of having to move in a direction contrary to that of\nthe wheel, the ants must necessarily complete their journeys in the\nopposite direction, and that ant which is nearest the centre must finish\nits circuit sooner, while the ant that is going round at the outer edge\nof the disc of the wheel must, on account of the size of its circuit,\nbe much slower in completing its course, even though it is moving just\nas quickly as the other. In the same way, these stars, which struggle on\nagainst the course of the firmament, are accomplishing an orbit on paths\nof their own; but, owing to the revolution of the heaven, they are swept\nback as it goes round every day.\n16. The reason why some of these stars are temperate, others hot, and\nothers cold, appears to be this: that the flame of every kind of fire\nrises to higher places. Consequently, the burning rays of the sun make\nthe ether above him white hot, in the regions of the course of Mars, and\nso the heat of the sun makes him hot. Saturn, on the contrary, being\nnearest to the outermost limit of the firmament and bordering on the\nquarters of the heaven which are frozen, is excessively cold. Hence,\nJupiter, whose course is between the orbits of these two, appears to\nhave a moderate and very temperate influence, intermediate between their\ncold and heat.\nI have now described, as I have received them from my teacher, the belt\nof the twelve signs and the seven stars that work and move in the\nopposite direction, with the laws and numerical relations under which\nthey pass from sign to sign, and how they complete their orbits. I shall\nnext speak of the waxing and waning of the moon, according to the\naccounts of my predecessors.\nCHAPTER II\nTHE PHASES OF THE MOON\n1. According to the teaching of Berosus, who came from the state, or\nrather nation, of the Chaldees, and was the pioneer of Chaldean learning\nin Asia, the moon is a ball, one half luminous and the rest of a blue\ncolour. When, in the course of her orbit, she has passed below the disc\nof the sun, she is attracted by his rays and great heat, and turns\nthither her luminous side, on account of the sympathy between light and\nlight. Being thus summoned by the sun's disc and facing upward, her\nlower half, as it is not luminous, is invisible on account of its\nlikeness to the air. When she is perpendicular to the sun's rays, all\nher light is confined to her upper surface, and she is then called the\nnew moon.\n2. As she moves on, passing by to the east, the effect of the sun upon\nher relaxes, and the outer edge of the luminous side sheds its light\nupon the earth in an exceedingly thin line. This is called the second\nday of the moon. Day by day she is further relieved and turns, and thus\nare numbered the third, fourth, and following days. On the seventh day,\nthe sun being in the west and the moon in the middle of the firmament\nbetween the east and west, she is half the extent of the firmament\ndistant from the sun, and therefore half of the luminous side is turned\ntoward the earth. But when the sun and moon are separated by the entire\nextent of the firmament, and the moon is in the east with the sun over\nagainst her in the west, she is completely relieved by her still greater\ndistance from his rays, and so, on the fourteenth day, she is at the\nfull, and her entire disc emits its light. On the succeeding days, up to\nthe end of the month, she wanes daily as she turns in her course, being\nrecalled by the sun until she comes under his disc and rays, thus\ncompleting the count of the days of the month.\n3. But Aristarchus of Samos, a mathematician of great powers, has left a\ndifferent explanation in his teaching on this subject, as I shall now\nset forth. It is no secret that the moon has no light of her own, but\nis, as it were, a mirror, receiving brightness from the influence of the\nsun. Of all the seven stars, the moon traverses the shortest orbit, and\nher course is nearest to the earth. Hence in every month, on the day\nbefore she gets past the sun, she is under his disc and rays, and is\nconsequently hidden and invisible. When she is thus in conjunction with\nthe sun, she is called the new moon. On the next day, reckoned as her\nsecond, she gets past the sun and shows the thin edge of her sphere.\nThree days away from the sun, she waxes and grows brighter. Removing\nfurther every day till she reaches the seventh, when her distance from\nthe sun at his setting is about one half the extent of the firmament,\none half of her is luminous: that is, the half which faces toward the\nsun is lighted up by him.\n4. On the fourteenth day, being diametrically across the whole extent of\nthe firmament from the sun, she is at her full and rises when the sun is\nsetting. For, as she takes her place over against him and distant the\nwhole extent of the firmament, she thus receives the light from the sun\nthroughout her entire orb. On the seventeenth day, at sunrise, she is\ninclining to the west. On the twenty-second day, after sunrise, the moon\nis about mid-heaven; hence, the side exposed to the sun is bright and\nthe rest dark. Continuing thus her daily course, she passes under the\nrays of the sun on about the twenty-eighth day, and so completes the\naccount of the month.\nI will next explain how the sun, passing through a different sign each\nmonth, causes the days and hours to increase and diminish in length.\nCHAPTER III\nTHE COURSE OF THE SUN THROUGH THE TWELVE SIGNS\n1. The sun, after entering the sign Aries and passing through one eighth\nof it, determines the vernal equinox. On reaching the tail of Taurus and\nthe constellation of the Pleiades, from which the front half of Taurus\nprojects, he advances into a space greater than half the firmament,\nmoving toward the north. From Taurus he enters Gemini at the time of the\nrising of the Pleiades, and, getting higher above the earth, he\nincreases the length of the days. Next, coming from Gemini into Cancer,\nwhich occupies the shortest space in heaven, and after traversing one\neighth of it, he determines the summer solstice. Continuing on, he\nreaches the head and breast of Leo, portions which are reckoned as\nbelonging to Cancer.\n2. After leaving the breast of Leo and the boundaries of Cancer, the\nsun, traversing the rest of Leo, makes the days shorter, diminishing the\nsize of his circuit, and returning to the same course that he had in\nGemini. Next, crossing from Leo into Virgo, and advancing as far as the\nbosom of her garment, he still further shortens his circuit, making his\ncourse equal to what it was in Taurus. Advancing from Virgo by way of\nthe bosom of her garment, which forms the first part of Libra, he\ndetermines the autumn equinox at the end of one eighth of Libra. Here\nhis course is equal to what his circuit was in the sign Aries.\n3. When the sun has entered Scorpio, at the time of the setting of the\nPleiades, he begins to make the days shorter as he advances toward the\nsouth. From Scorpio he enters Sagittarius and, on reaching the thighs,\nhis daily course is still further diminished. From the thighs of\nSagittarius, which are reckoned as part of Capricornus, he reaches the\nend of the first eighth of the latter, where his course in heaven is\nshortest. Consequently, this season, from the shortness of the day, is\ncalled bruma or dies brumales. Crossing from Capricornus into Aquarius,\nhe causes the days to increase to the length which they had when he was\nin Sagittarius. From Aquarius he enters Pisces at the time when Favonius\nbegins to blow, and here his course is the same as in Scorpio. In this\nway the sun passes round through the signs, lengthening or shortening\nthe days and hours at definite seasons.\nI shall next speak of the other constellations formed by arrangements of\nstars, and lying to the right and left of the belt of the signs, in the\nsouthern and northern portions of the firmament.\nCHAPTER IV\nTHE NORTHERN CONSTELLATIONS\n1. The Great Bear, called in Greek [Greek: arktos] or [Greek: helik\u00ea],\nhas her Warden behind her. Near him is the Virgin, on whose right\nshoulder rests a very bright star which we call Harbinger of the\nVintage, and the Greeks [Greek: protryg\u00eat\u00eas]. But Spica in that\nconstellation is brighter. Opposite there is another star, coloured,\nbetween the knees of the Bear Warden, dedicated there under the name of\nArcturus.\n2. Opposite the head of the Bear, at an angle with the feet of the\nTwins, is the Charioteer, standing on the tip of the horn of the Bull;\nhence, one and the same star is found in the tip of the left horn of the\nBull and in the right foot of the Charioteer. Supported on the hand of\nthe Charioteer are the Kids, with the She-Goat at his left shoulder.\nAbove the Bull and the Ram is Perseus, having at his right...[11] with\nthe Pleiades moving beneath, and at his left the head of the Ram. His\nright hand rests on the likeness of Cassiopea, and with his left he\nholds the Gorgon's head by its top over the Ram, laying it at the feet\nof Andromeda.\n[Note 11: From this point to the end of section 3 the text is often\nhopelessly corrupt. The translation follows, approximately, the\nmanuscript reading, but cannot pretend to be exact.]\n3. Above Andromeda are the Fishes, one above her belly and the other\nabove the backbone of the Horse. A very bright star terminates both the\nbelly of the Horse and the head of Andromeda. Andromeda's right hand\nrests above the likeness of Cassiopea, and her left above the Northern\nFish. The Waterman's head is above that of the Horse. The Horse's hoofs\nlie close to the Waterman's knees. Cassiopea is set apart in the midst.\nHigh above the He-Goat are the Eagle and the Dolphin, and near them is\nthe Arrow. Farther on is the Bird, whose right wing grazes the head and\nsceptre of Cepheus, with its left resting over Cassiopea. Under the tail\nof the Bird lie the feet of the Horse.\n4. Above the Archer, Scorpion, and Balance, is the Serpent, reaching to\nthe Crown with the end of its snout. Next, the Serpent-holder grasps the\nSerpent about the middle in his hands, and with his left foot treads\nsquarely on the foreparts of the Scorpion. A little way from the head of\nthe Serpent-holder is the head of the so-called Kneeler. Their heads are\nthe more readily to be distinguished as the stars which compose them are\nby no means dim.\n5. The foot of the Kneeler rests on the temple of that Serpent which is\nentwined between the She-Bears (called Septentriones). The little\nDolphin moves in front of the Horse. Opposite the bill of the Bird is\nthe Lyre. The Crown is arranged between the shoulders of the Warden and\nthe Kneeler. In the northern circle are the two She-Bears with their\nshoulder-blades confronting and their breasts turned away from one\nanother. The Greeks call the Lesser Bear [Greek: kynosoura], and the\nGreater [Greek: elik\u00ea]. Their heads face different ways, and their tails\nare shaped so that each is in front of the head of the other Bear; for\nthe tails of both stick up over them.\n6. The Serpent is said to lie stretched out between their tails, and in\nit there is a star, called Polus, shining near the head of the Greater\nBear. At the nearest point, the Serpent winds its head round, but is\nalso flung in a fold round the head of the Lesser Bear, and stretches\nout close to her feet. Here it twists back, making another fold, and,\nlifting itself up, bends its snout and right temple from the head of the\nLesser Bear round towards the Greater. Above the tail of the Lesser Bear\nare the feet of Cepheus, and at this point, at the very top, are stars\nforming an equilateral triangle. There are a good many stars common to\nthe Lesser Bear and to Cepheus.\nI have now mentioned the constellations which are arranged in the heaven\nto the right of the east, between the belt of the signs and the north. I\nshall next describe those that Nature has distributed to the left of the\neast and in the southern regions.\nCHAPTER V\nTHE SOUTHERN CONSTELLATIONS\n1. First, under the He-Goat lies the Southern Fish, facing towards the\ntail of the Whale. The Censer is under the Scorpion's sting. The fore\nparts of the Centaur are next to the Balance and the Scorpion, and he\nholds in his hands the figure which astronomers call the Beast. Beneath\nthe Virgin, Lion, and Crab is the twisted girdle formed by the Snake,\nextending over a whole line of stars, his snout raised near the Crab,\nsupporting the Bowl with the middle of his body near the Lion, and\nbringing his tail, on which is the Raven, under and near the hand of the\nVirgin. The region above his shoulders is equally bright.\n2. Beneath the Snake's belly, at the tail, lies the Centaur. Near the\nBowl and the Lion is the ship named Argo. Her bow is invisible, but her\nmast and the parts about the helm are in plain sight, the stern of the\nvessel joining the Dog at the tip of his tail. The Little Dog follows\nthe Twins, and is opposite the Snake's head. The Greater Dog follows the\nLesser. Orion lies aslant, under the Bull's hoof; in his left hand\ngrasping his club, and raising the other toward the Twins.\n3. At his feet is the Dog, following a little behind the Hare. The Whale\nlies under the Ram and the Fishes, and from his mane there is a slight\nsprinkling of stars, called in Greek [Greek: harpedonai], regularly\ndisposed towards each of the Fishes. This ligature by which they hang is\ncarried a great way inwards, but reaches out to the top of the mane of\nthe Whale. The River, formed of stars, flows from a source at the left\nfoot of Orion. But the Water, said to pour from the Waterman, flows\nbetween the head of the Southern Fish and the tail of the Whale.\n4. These constellations, whose outlines and shapes in the heavens were\ndesigned by Nature and the divine intelligence, I have described\naccording to the view of the natural philosopher Democritus, but only\nthose whose risings and settings we can observe and see with our own\neyes. Just as the Bears turn round the pivot of the axis without ever\nsetting or sinking under the earth, there are likewise stars that keep\nturning round the southern pivot, which on account of the inclination of\nthe firmament lies always under the earth, and, being hidden there, they\nnever rise and emerge above the earth. Consequently, the figures which\nthey form are unknown to us on account of the interposition of the\nearth. The star Canopus proves this. It is unknown to our vicinity; but\nwe have reports of it from merchants who have been to the most distant\npart of Egypt, and to regions bordering on the uttermost boundaries of\nthe earth.\nCHAPTER VI\nASTROLOGY AND WEATHER PROGNOSTICS\n1. I have shown how the firmament, and the twelve signs with the\nconstellations arranged to the north and south of them, fly round the\nearth, so that the matter may be clearly understood. For it is from this\nrevolution of the firmament, from the course of the sun through the\nsigns in the opposite direction, and from the shadows cast by\nequinoctial gnomons, that we find the figure of the analemma.\n2. As for the branch of astronomy which concerns the influences of the\ntwelve signs, the five stars, the sun, and the moon upon human life, we\nmust leave all this to the calculations of the Chaldeans, to whom\nbelongs the art of casting nativities, which enables them to declare the\npast and the future by means of calculations based on the stars. These\ndiscoveries have been transmitted by the men of genius and great\nacuteness who sprang directly from the nation of the Chaldeans; first of\nall, by Berosus, who settled in the island state of Cos, and there\nopened a school. Afterwards Antipater pursued the subject; then there\nwas Archinapolus, who also left rules for casting nativities, based not\non the moment of birth but on that of conception.\n3. When we come to natural philosophy, however, Thales of Miletus,\nAnaxagoras of Clazomenae, Pythagoras of Samos, Xenophanes of Colophon,\nand Democritus of Abdera have in various ways investigated and left us\nthe laws and the working of the laws by which nature governs it. In the\ntrack of their discoveries, Eudoxus, Euctemon, Callippus, Meto,\nPhilippus, Hipparchus, Aratus, and others discovered the risings and\nsettings of the constellations, as well as weather prognostications from\nastronomy through the study of the calendars, and this study they set\nforth and left to posterity. Their learning deserves the admiration of\nmankind; for they were so solicitous as even to be able to predict, long\nbeforehand, with divining mind, the signs of the weather which was to\nfollow in the future. On this subject, therefore, reference must be made\nto their labours and investigations.\nCHAPTER VII\nTHE ANALEMMA AND ITS APPLICATIONS\n1. In distinction from the subjects first mentioned, we must ourselves\nexplain the principles which govern the shortening and lengthening of\nthe day. When the sun is at the equinoxes, that is, passing through\nAries or Libra, he makes the gnomon cast a shadow equal to eight ninths\nof its own length, in the latitude of Rome. In Athens, the shadow is\nequal to three fourths of the length of the gnomon; at Rhodes to five\nsevenths; at Tarentum, to nine elevenths; at Alexandria, to three\nfifths; and so at other places it is found that the shadows of\nequinoctial gnomons are naturally different from one another.\n2. Hence, wherever a sundial is to be constructed, we must take the\nequinoctial shadow of the place. If it is found to be, as in Rome, equal\nto eight ninths of the gnomon, let a line be drawn on a plane surface,\nand in the middle thereof erect a perpendicular, plumb to the line,\nwhich perpendicular is called the gnomon. Then, from the line in the\nplane, let the line of the gnomon be divided off by the compasses into\nnine parts, and take the point designating the ninth part as a centre,\nto be marked by the letter A. Then, opening the compasses from that\ncentre to the line in the plane at the point B, describe a circle. This\ncircle is called the meridian.\n3. Then, of the nine parts between the plane and the centre on the\ngnomon, take eight, and mark them off on the line in the plane to the\npoint C. This will be the equinoctial shadow of the gnomon. From that\npoint, marked by C, let a line be drawn through the centre at the point\nA, and this will represent a ray of the sun at the equinox. Then,\nextending the compasses from the centre to the line in the plane, mark\noff the equidistant points E on the left and I on the right, on the two\nsides of the circumference, and let a line be drawn through the centre,\ndividing the circle into two equal semicircles. This line is called by\nmathematicians the horizon.\n[Illustration]\n4. Then, take a fifteenth part of the entire circumference, and, placing\nthe centre of the compasses on the circumference at the point where the\nequinoctial ray cuts it at the letter F, mark off the points G and H on\nthe right and left. Then lines must be drawn from these (and the centre)\nto the line of the plane at the points T and R, and thus, one will\nrepresent the ray of the sun in winter, and the other the ray in summer.\nOpposite E will be the point I, where the line drawn through the centre\nat the point A cuts the circumference; opposite G and H will be the\npoints L and K; and opposite C, F, and A will be the point N.\n5. Then, diameters are to be drawn from G to L and from H to K. The\nupper will denote the summer and the lower the winter portion. These\ndiameters are to be divided equally in the middle at the points M and O,\nand those centres marked; then, through these marks and the centre A,\ndraw a line extending to the two sides of the circumference at the\npoints P and Q. This will be a line perpendicular to the equinoctial\nray, and it is called in mathematical figures the axis. From these same\ncentres open the compasses to the ends of the diameters, and describe\nsemicircles, one of which will be for summer and the other for winter.\n6. Then, at the points at which the parallel lines cut the line called\nthe horizon, the letter S is to be on the right and the letter V on the\nleft, and from the extremity of the semicircle, at the point G, draw a\nline parallel to the axis, extending to the left-hand semicircle at the\npoint H. This parallel line is called the Logotomus. Then, centre the\ncompasses at the point where the equinoctial ray cuts that line, at the\nletter D, and open them to the point where the summer ray cuts the\ncircumference at the letter H. From the equinoctial centre, with a\nradius extending to the summer ray, describe the circumference of the\ncircle of the months, which is called Menaeus. Thus we shall have the\nfigure of the analemma.\n7. This having been drawn and completed, the scheme of hours is next to\nbe drawn on the baseplates from the analemma, according to the winter\nlines, or those of summer, or the equinoxes, or the months, and thus\nmany different kinds of dials may be laid down and drawn by this\ningenious method. But the result of all these shapes and designs is in\none respect the same: namely, the days of the equinoxes and of the\nwinter and summer solstices are always divided into twelve equal parts.\nOmitting details, therefore,--not for fear of the trouble, but lest I\nshould prove tiresome by writing too much,--I will state by whom the\ndifferent classes and designs of dials have been invented. For I cannot\ninvent new kinds myself at this late day, nor do I think that I ought to\ndisplay the inventions of others as my own. Hence, I will mention those\nthat have come down to us, and by whom they were invented.\nCHAPTER VIII\nSUNDIALS AND WATER CLOCKS\n1. The semicircular form, hollowed out of a square block, and cut under\nto correspond to the polar altitude, is said to have been invented by\nBerosus the Chaldean; the Scaphe or Hemisphere, by Aristarchus of Samos,\nas well as the disc on a plane surface; the Arachne, by the astronomer\nEudoxus or, as some say, by Apollonius; the Plinthium or Lacunar, like\nthe one placed in the Circus Flaminius, by Scopinas of Syracuse; the\n[Greek: pros ta historoumena], by Parmenio; the [Greek: pros pan klima],\nby Theodosius and Andreas; the Pelecinum, by Patrocles; the Cone, by\nDionysodorus; the Quiver, by Apollonius. The men whose names are written\nabove, as well as many others, have invented and left us other kinds:\nas, for instance, the Conarachne, the Conical Plinthium, and the\nAntiborean. Many have also left us written directions for making dials\nof these kinds for travellers, which can be hung up. Whoever wishes to\nfind their baseplates, can easily do so from the books of these writers,\nprovided only he understands the figure of the analemma.\n2. Methods of making water clocks have been investigated by the same\nwriters, and first of all by Ctesibius the Alexandrian, who also\ndiscovered the natural pressure of the air and pneumatic principles. It\nis worth while for students to know how these discoveries came about.\nCtesibius, born at Alexandria, was the son of a barber. Pre\u00ebminent for\nnatural ability and great industry, he is said to have amused himself\nwith ingenious devices. For example, wishing to hang a mirror in his\nfather's shop in such a way that, on being lowered and raised again, its\nweight should be raised by means of a concealed cord, he employed the\nfollowing mechanical contrivance.\n3. Under the roof-beam he fixed a wooden channel in which he arranged a\nblock of pulleys. He carried the cord along the channel to the corner,\nwhere he set up some small piping. Into this a leaden ball, attached to\nthe cord, was made to descend. As the weight fell into the narrow limits\nof the pipe, it naturally compressed the enclosed air, and, as its fall\nwas rapid, it forced the mass of compressed air through the outlet into\nthe open air, thus producing a distinct sound by the concussion.\n4. Hence, Ctesibius, observing that sounds and tones were produced by\nthe contact between the free air and that which was forced from the\npipe, made use of this principle in the construction of the first water\norgans. He also devised methods of raising water, automatic\ncontrivances, and amusing things of many kinds, including among them the\nconstruction of water clocks. He began by making an orifice in a piece\nof gold, or by perforating a gem, because these substances are not worn\nby the action of water, and do not collect dirt so as to get stopped up.\n5. A regular flow of water through the orifice raises an inverted bowl,\ncalled by mechanicians the \"cork\" or \"drum.\" To this are attached a rack\nand a revolving drum, both fitted with teeth at regular intervals. These\nteeth, acting upon one another, induce a measured revolution and\nmovement. Other racks and other drums, similarly toothed and subject to\nthe same motion, give rise by their revolution to various kinds of\nmotions, by which figures are moved, cones revolve, pebbles or eggs\nfall, trumpets sound, and other incidental effects take place.\n6. The hours are marked in these clocks on a column or a pilaster, and a\nfigure emerging from the bottom points to them with a rod throughout the\nwhole day. Their decrease or increase in length with the different days\nand months, must be adjusted by inserting or withdrawing wedges. The\nshutoffs for regulating the water are constructed as follows. Two cones\nare made, one solid and the other hollow, turned on a lathe so that one\nwill go into the other and fit it perfectly. A rod is used to loosen or\nto bring them together, thus causing the water to flow rapidly or slowly\ninto the vessels. According to these rules, and by this mechanism, water\nclocks may be constructed for use in winter.\n7. But if it proves that the shortening or lengthening of the day is\nnot in agreement with the insertion and removal of the wedges, because\nthe wedges may very often cause errors, the following arrangement will\nhave to be made. Let the hours be marked off transversely on the column\nfrom the analemma, and let the lines of the months also be marked upon\nthe column. Then let the column be made to revolve, in such a way that,\nas it turns continuously towards the figure and the rod with which the\nemerging figure points to the hours, it may make the hours short or long\naccording to the respective months.\n8. There is also another kind of winter dial, called the Anaphoric and\nconstructed in the following way. The hours, indicated by bronze rods in\naccordance with the figure of the analemma, radiate from a centre on the\nface. Circles are described upon it, marking the limits of the months.\nBehind these rods there is a drum, on which is drawn and painted the\nfirmament with the circle of the signs. In drawing the figures of the\ntwelve celestial signs, one is represented larger and the next smaller,\nproceeding from the centre. Into the back of the drum, in the middle, a\nrevolving axis is inserted, and round that axis is wound a flexible\nbronze chain, at one end of which hangs the \"cork\" which is raised by\nthe water, and at the other a counterpoise of sand, equal in weight to\nthe \"cork.\"\n9. Hence, the sand sinks as the \"cork\" is raised by the water, and in\nsinking turns the axis, and the axis the drum. The revolution of this\ndrum causes sometimes a larger and sometimes a smaller portion of the\ncircle of the signs to indicate, during the revolutions, the proper\nlength of the hours corresponding to their seasons. For in every one of\nthe signs there are as many holes as the corresponding month has days,\nand a boss, which seems to be holding the representation of the sun on a\ndial, designates the spaces for the hours. This, as it is carried from\nhole to hole, completes the circuit of a full month.\n10. Hence, just as the sun during his passage through the constellations\nmakes the days and hours longer or shorter, so the boss on a dial,\nmoving from point to point in a direction contrary to that of the\nrevolution of the drum in the middle, is carried day by day sometimes\nover wider and sometimes over narrower spaces, giving a representation\nof the hours and days within the limits of each month.\nTo manage the water so that it may flow regularly, we must proceed as\nfollows.\n11. Inside, behind the face of the dial, place a reservoir, and let the\nwater run down into it through a pipe, and let it have a hole at the\nbottom. Fastened to it is a bronze drum with an opening through which\nthe water flows into it from the reservoir. Enclosed in this drum there\nis a smaller one, the two being perfectly jointed together by tenon and\nsocket, in such a way that the smaller drum revolves closely but easily\nin the larger, like a stopcock.\n12. On the lip of the larger drum there are three hundred and sixty-five\npoints, marked off at equal intervals. The rim of the smaller one has a\ntongue fixed on its circumference, with the tip directed towards those\npoints; and also in this rim is a small opening, through which water\nruns into the drum and keeps the works going. The figures of the\ncelestial signs being on the lip of the larger drum, and this drum being\nmotionless, let the sign Cancer be drawn at the top, with Capricornus\nperpendicular to it at the bottom, Libra at the spectator's right, Aries\nat his left, and let the other signs be given places between them as\nthey are seen in the heavens.\n13. Hence, when the sun is in Capricornus, the tongue on the rim touches\nevery day one of the points in Capricornus on the lip of the larger\ndrum, and is perpendicular to the strong pressure of the running water.\nSo the water is quickly driven through the opening in the rim to the\ninside of the vessel, which, receiving it and soon becoming full,\nshortens and diminishes the length of the days and hours. But when,\nowing to the daily revolution of the smaller drum, its tongue reaches\nthe points in Aquarius, the opening will no longer be perpendicular, and\nthe water must give up its vigorous flow and run in a slower stream.\nThus, the less the velocity with which the vessel receives the water,\nthe more the length of the days is increased.\n14. Then the opening in the rim passes from point to point in Aquarius\nand Pisces, as though going upstairs, and when it reaches the end of the\nfirst eighth of Aries, the fall of the water is of medium strength,\nindicating the equinoctial hours. From Aries the opening passes, with\nthe revolution of the drum, through Taurus and Gemini to the highest\npoint at the end of the first eighth of Cancer, and when it reaches that\npoint, the power diminishes, and hence, with the slower flow, its delay\nlengthens the days in the sign Cancer, producing the hours of the summer\nsolstice. From Cancer it begins to decline, and during its return it\npasses through Leo and Virgo to the points at the end of the first\neighth of Libra, gradually shortening and diminishing the length of the\nhours, until it comes to the points in Libra, where it makes the hours\nequinoctial once more.\n15. Finally, the opening comes down more rapidly through Scorpio and\nSagittarius, and on its return from its revolution to the end of the\nfirst eighth of Capricornus, the velocity of the stream renews once more\nthe short hours of the winter solstice.\nThe rules and forms of construction employed in designing dials have now\nbeen described as well as I could. It remains to give an account of\nmachines and their principles. In order to make my treatise on\narchitecture complete, I will begin to write on this subject in the\nfollowing book.\nBOOK X\nINTRODUCTION\n1. In the famous and important Greek city of Ephesus there is said to be\nan ancient ancestral law, the terms of which are severe, but its justice\nis not inequitable. When an architect accepts the charge of a public\nwork, he has to promise what the cost of it will be. His estimate is\nhanded to the magistrate, and his property is pledged as security until\nthe work is done. When it is finished, if the outlay agrees with his\nstatement, he is complimented by decrees and marks of honour. If no more\nthan a fourth has to be added to his estimate, it is furnished by the\ntreasury and no penalty is inflicted. But when more than one fourth has\nto be spent in addition on the work, the money required to finish it is\ntaken from his property.\n2. Would to God that this were also a law of the Roman people, not\nmerely for public, but also for private buildings. For the ignorant\nwould no longer run riot with impunity, but men who are well qualified\nby an exact scientific training would unquestionably adopt the\nprofession of architecture. Gentlemen would not be misled into limitless\nand prodigal expenditure, even to ejectments from their estates, and the\narchitects themselves could be forced, by fear of the penalty, to be\nmore careful in calculating and stating the limit of expense, so that\ngentlemen would procure their buildings for that which they had\nexpected, or by adding only a little more. It is true that men who can\nafford to devote four hundred thousand to a work may hold on, if they\nhave to add another hundred thousand, from the pleasure which the hope\nof finishing it gives them; but if they are loaded with a fifty per cent\nincrease, or with an even greater expense, they lose hope, sacrifice\nwhat they have already spent, and are compelled to leave off, broken in\nfortune and in spirit.\n3. This fault appears not only in the matter of buildings, but also in\nthe shows given by magistrates, whether of gladiators in the forum or of\nplays on the stage. Here neither delay nor postponement is permissible,\nbut the necessities of the case require that everything should be ready\nat a fixed time,--the seats for the audience, the awning drawn over\nthem, and whatever, in accordance with the customs of the stage, is\nprovided by machinery to please the eye of the people. These matters\nrequire careful thought and planning by a well trained intellect; for\nnone of them can be accomplished without machinery, and without hard\nstudy skilfully applied in various ways.\n4. Therefore, since such are our traditions and established practices,\nit is obviously fitting that the plans should be worked out carefully,\nand with the greatest attention, before the structures are begun.\nConsequently, as we have no law or customary practice to compel this,\nand as every year both praetors and aediles have to provide machinery\nfor the festivals, I have thought it not out of place, Emperor, since I\nhave treated of buildings in the earlier books, to set forth and teach\nin this, which forms the final conclusion of my treatise, the principles\nwhich govern machines.\nCHAPTER I\nMACHINES AND IMPLEMENTS\n1. A machine is a combination of timbers fastened together, chiefly\nefficacious in moving great weights. Such a machine is set in motion on\nscientific principles in circular rounds, which the Greeks call [Greek:\nkyklik\u00ea kin\u00eaois]. There is, however, a class intended for climbing,\ntermed in Greek [Greek: akrobatikon], another worked by air, which with\nthem is called [Greek: pneumatikon], and a third for hoisting; this the\nGreeks named [Greek: baroulkos]. In the climbing class are machines so\ndisposed that one can safely climb up high, by means of timbers set up\non end and connected by crossbeams, in order to view operations. In the\npneumatic class, air is forced by pressure to produce sounds and tones\nas in an [Greek: organon].\n2. In the hoisting class, heavy weights are removed by machines which\nraise them up and set them in position. The climbing machine displays no\nscientific principle, but merely a spirit of daring. It is held together\nby dowels and crossbeams and twisted lashings and supporting props. A\nmachine that gets its motive power by pneumatic pressure will produce\npretty effects by scientific refinements. But the hoisting machine has\nopportunities for usefulness which are greater and full of grandeur, and\nit is of the highest efficacy when used with intelligence.\n3. Some of these act on the principle of the [Greek: m\u00eachan\u00ea], others on\nthat of the [Greek: organon]. The difference between \"machines\" and\n\"engines\" is obviously this, that machines need more workmen and greater\npower to make them take effect, as for instance ballistae and the beams\nof presses. Engines, on the other hand, accomplish their purpose at the\nintelligent touch of a single workman, as the scorpio or anisocycli when\nthey are turned. Therefore engines, as well as machines, are, in\nprinciple, practical necessities, without which nothing can be\nunattended with difficulties.\n4. All machinery is derived from nature, and is founded on the teaching\nand instruction of the revolution of the firmament. Let us but consider\nthe connected revolutions of the sun, the moon, and the five planets,\nwithout the revolution of which, due to mechanism, we should not have\nhad the alternation of day and night, nor the ripening of fruits. Thus,\nwhen our ancestors had seen that this was so, they took their models\nfrom nature, and by imitating them were led on by divine facts, until\nthey perfected the contrivances which are so serviceable in our life.\nSome things, with a view to greater convenience, they worked out by\nmeans of machines and their revolutions, others by means of engines, and\nso, whatever they found to be useful for investigations, for the arts,\nand for established practices, they took care to improve step by step on\nscientific principles.\n5. Let us take first a necessary invention, such as clothing, and see\nhow the combination of warp and woof on the loom, which does its work on\nthe principle of an engine, not only protects the body by covering it,\nbut also gives it honourable apparel. We should not have had food in\nabundance unless yokes and ploughs for oxen, and for all draught\nanimals, had been invented. If there had been no provision of\nwindlasses, pressbeams, and levers for presses, we could not have had\nthe shining oil, nor the fruit of the vine to give us pleasure, and\nthese things could not be transported on land without the invention of\nthe mechanism of carts or waggons, nor on the sea without that of ships.\n6. The discovery of the method of testing weights by steelyards and\nbalances saves us from fraud, by introducing honest practices into life.\nThere are also innumerable ways of employing machinery about which it\nseems unnecessary to speak, since they are at hand every day; such as\nmills, blacksmiths' bellows, carriages, gigs, turning lathes, and other\nthings which are habitually used as general conveniences. Hence, we\nshall begin by explaining those that rarely come to hand, so that they\nmay be understood.\nCHAPTER II\nHOISTING MACHINES\n1. First we shall treat of those machines which are of necessity made\nready when temples and public buildings are to be constructed. Two\ntimbers are provided, strong enough for the weight of the load. They are\nfastened together at the upper end by a bolt, then spread apart at the\nbottom, and so set up, being kept upright by ropes attached at the upper\nends and fixed at intervals all round. At the top is fastened a block,\nwhich some call a \"rechamus.\" In the block two sheaves are enclosed,\nturning on axles. The traction rope is carried over the sheave at the\ntop, then let fall and passed round a sheave in a block below. Then it\nis brought back to a sheave at the bottom of the upper block, and so it\ngoes down to the lower block, where it is fastened through a hole in\nthat block. The other end of the rope is brought back and down between\nthe legs of the machine.\n2. Socket-pieces are nailed to the hinder faces of the squared timbers\nat the point where they are spread apart, and the ends of the windlass\nare inserted into them so that the axles may turn freely. Close to each\nend of the windlass are two holes, so adjusted that handspikes can be\nfitted into them. To the bottom of the lower block are fastened shears\nmade of iron, whose prongs are brought to bear upon the stones, which\nhave holes bored in them. When one end of the rope is fastened to the\nwindlass, and the latter is turned round by working the handspikes, the\nrope winds round the windlass, gets taut, and thus it raises the load to\nthe proper height and to its place in the work.\n3. This kind of machinery, revolving with three sheaves, is called a\ntrispast. When there are two sheaves turning in the block beneath and\nthree in the upper, the machine is termed a pentaspast. But if we have\nto furnish machines for heavier loads, we must use timbers of greater\nlength and thickness, providing them with correspondingly large bolts at\nthe top, and windlasses turning at the bottom. When these are ready,\nlet forestays be attached and left lying slack in front; let the\nbackstays be carried over the shoulders of the machine to some distance,\nand, if there is nothing to which they can be fastened, sloping piles\nshould be driven, the ground rammed down all round to fix them firmly,\nand the ropes made fast to them.\n4. A block should then be attached by a stout cord to the top of the\nmachine, and from that point a rope should be carried to a pile, and to\na block tied to the pile. Let the rope be put in round the sheave of\nthis block, and brought back to the block that is fastened at the top of\nthe machine. Round its sheave the rope should be passed, and then should\ngo down from the top, and back to the windlass, which is at the bottom\nof the machine, and there be fastened. The windlass is now to be turned\nby means of the handspikes, and it will raise the machine of itself\nwithout danger. Thus, a machine of the larger kind will be set in\nposition, with its ropes in their places about it, and its stays\nattached to the piles. Its blocks and traction ropes are arranged as\ndescribed above.\n5. But if the loads of material for the work are still more colossal in\nsize and weight, we shall not entrust them to a windlass, but set in an\naxle-tree, held by sockets as the windlass was, and carrying on its\ncentre a large drum, which some term a wheel, but the Greeks call it\n[Greek: amphiesis] or [Greek: perith\u00eakion].\n6. And the blocks in such machines are not arranged in the same, but in\na different manner; for the rows of sheaves in them are doubled, both at\nthe bottom and at the top. The traction rope is passed through a hole in\nthe lower block, in such a way that the two ends of the rope are of\nequal length when it is stretched out, and both portions are held there\nat the lower block by a cord which is passed round them and lashed so\nthat they cannot come out either to the right or the left. Then the ends\nof the rope are brought up into the block at the top from the outside,\nand passed down over its lower sheaves, and so return to the bottom, and\nare passed from the inside to the sheaves in the lowest block, and then\nare brought up on the right and left, and return to the top and round\nthe highest set of sheaves.\n7. Passing over these from the outside, they are then carried to the\nright and left of the drum on the axle-tree, and are tied there so as to\nstay fast. Then another rope is wound round the drum and carried to a\ncapstan, and when that is turned, it turns the drum and the axle-tree,\nthe ropes get taut as they wind round regularly, and thus they raise the\nloads smoothly and with no danger. But if a larger drum is placed either\nin the middle or at one side, without any capstan, men can tread in it\nand accomplish the work more expeditiously.\n8. There is also another kind of machine, ingenious enough and easy to\nuse with speed, but only experts can work with it. It consists of a\nsingle timber, which is set up and held in place by stays on four sides.\nTwo cheeks are nailed on below the stays, a block is fastened by ropes\nabove the cheeks, and a straight piece of wood about two feet long, six\ndigits wide, and four digits thick, is put under the block. The blocks\nused have each three rows of sheaves side by side. Hence three traction\nropes are fastened at the top of the machine. Then they are brought to\nthe block at the bottom, and passed from the inside round the sheaves\nthat are nearest the top of it. Then they are brought back to the upper\nblock, and passed inwards from outside round the sheaves nearest the\nbottom.\n9. On coming down to the block at the bottom, they are carried round its\nsecond row of sheaves from the inside to the outside, and brought back\nto the second row at the top, passing round it and returning to the\nbottom; then from the bottom they are carried to the summit, where they\npass round the highest row of sheaves, and then return to the bottom of\nthe machine. At the foot of the machine a third block is attached. The\nGreeks call it [Greek: epag\u00f4n], but our people \"artemon.\" This block\nfastened at the foot of the machine has three sheaves in it, round which\nthe ropes are passed and then delivered to men to pull. Thus, three rows\nof men, pulling without a capstan, can quickly raise the load to the\ntop.\n10. This kind of machine is called a polyspast, because of the many\nrevolving sheaves to which its dexterity and despatch are due. There is\nalso this advantage in the erection of only a single timber, that by\npreviously inclining it to the right or left as much as one wishes, the\nload can be set down at one side.\nAll these kinds of machinery described above are, in their principles,\nsuited not only to the purposes mentioned, but also to the loading and\nunloading of ships, some kinds being set upright, and others placed\nhorizontally on revolving platforms. On the same principle, ships can be\nhauled ashore by means of arrangements of ropes and blocks used on the\nground, without setting up timbers.\n11. It may also not be out of place to explain the ingenious procedure\nof Chersiphron. Desiring to convey the shafts for the temple of Diana at\nEphesus from the stone quarries, and not trusting to carts, lest their\nwheels should be engulfed on account of the great weights of the load\nand the softness of the roads in the plain, he tried the following plan.\nUsing four-inch timbers, he joined two of them, each as long as the\nshaft, with two crosspieces set between them, dovetailing all together,\nand then leaded iron gudgeons shaped like dovetails into the ends of the\nshafts, as dowels are leaded, and in the woodwork he fixed rings to\ncontain the pivots, and fastened wooden cheeks to the ends. The pivots,\nbeing enclosed in the rings, turned freely. So, when yokes of oxen began\nto draw the four-inch frame, they made the shaft revolve constantly,\nturning it by means of the pivots and rings.\n12. When they had thus transported all the shafts, and it became\nnecessary to transport the architraves, Chersiphron's son Metagenes\nextended the same principle from the transportation of the shafts to the\nbringing down of the architraves. He made wheels, each about twelve feet\nin diameter, and enclosed the ends of the architraves in the wheels. In\nthe ends he fixed pivots and rings in the same way. So when the\nfour-inch frames were drawn by oxen, the wheels turned on the pivots\nenclosed in the rings, and the architraves, which were enclosed like\naxles in the wheels, soon reached the building, in the same way as the\nshafts. The rollers used for smoothing the walks in palaestrae will\nserve as an example of this method. But it could not have been employed\nunless the distance had been short; for it is not more than eight miles\nfrom the stone-quarries to the temple, and there is no hill, but an\nuninterrupted plain.\n13. In our own times, however, when the pedestal of the colossal Apollo\nin his temple had cracked with age, they were afraid that the statue\nwould fall and be broken, and so they contracted for the cutting of a\npedestal from the same quarries. The contract was taken by one Paconius.\nThis pedestal was twelve feet long, eight feet wide, and six feet high.\nPaconius, with confident pride, did not transport it by the method of\nMetagenes, but determined to make a machine of a different sort, though\non the same principle.\n14. He made wheels of about fifteen feet in diameter, and in these\nwheels he enclosed the ends of the stone; then he fastened two-inch\ncrossbars from wheel to wheel round the stone, encompassing it, so that\nthere was an interval of not more than one foot between bar and bar.\nThen he coiled a rope round the bars, yoked up his oxen, and began to\ndraw on the rope. Consequently as it uncoiled, it did indeed cause the\nwheels to turn, but it could not draw them in a line straight along the\nroad, but kept swerving out to one side. Hence it was necessary to draw\nthe machine back again. Thus, by this drawing to and fro, Paconius got\ninto such financial embarrassment that he became insolvent.\n15. I will digress a bit and explain how these stone-quarries were\ndiscovered. Pixodorus was a shepherd who lived in that vicinity. When\nthe people of Ephesus were planning to build the temple of Diana in\nmarble, and debating whether to get the marble from Paros, Proconnesus,\nHeraclea, or Thasos, Pixodorus drove out his sheep and was feeding his\nflock in that very spot. Then two rams ran at each other, and, each\npassing the other, one of them, after his charge, struck his horns\nagainst a rock, from which a fragment of extremely white colour was\ndislodged. So it is said that Pixodorus left his sheep in the mountains\nand ran down to Ephesus carrying the fragment, since that very thing was\nthe question of the moment. Therefore they immediately decreed honours\nto him and changed his name, so that instead of Pixodorus he should be\ncalled Evangelus. And to this day the chief magistrate goes out to that\nvery spot every month and offers sacrifice to him, and if he does not,\nhe is punished.\nCHAPTER III\nTHE ELEMENTS OF MOTION\n1. I have briefly set forth what I thought necessary about the\nprinciples of hoisting machines. In them two different things, unlike\neach other, work together, as elements of their motion and power, to\nproduce these effects. One of them is the right line, which the Greeks\nterm [Greek: eutheia]; the other is the circle, which the Greeks call\n[Greek: kykl\u00f4t\u00ea]; but in point of fact, neither rectilinear without\ncircular motion, nor revolutions, without rectilinear motion, can\naccomplish the raising of loads. I will explain this, so that it may be\nunderstood.\n2. As centres, axles are inserted into the sheaves, and these are\nfastened in the blocks; a rope carried over the sheaves, drawn straight\ndown, and fastened to a windlass, causes the load to move upward from\nits place as the handspikes are turned. The pivots of this windlass,\nlying as centres in right lines in its socket-pieces, and the handspikes\ninserted in its holes, make the load rise when the ends of the windlass\nrevolve in a circle like a lathe. Just so, when an iron lever is applied\nto a weight which a great many hands cannot move, with the fulcrum,\nwhich the Greeks call [Greek: hupomochlion], lying as a centre in a\nright line under the lever, and with the tongue of the lever placed\nunder the weight, one man's strength, bearing down upon the head of it,\nheaves up the weight.\n3. For, as the shorter fore part of the lever goes under the weight from\nthe fulcrum that forms the centre, the head of it, which is farther away\nfrom that centre, on being depressed, is made to describe a circular\nmovement, and thus by pressure brings to an equilibrium the weight of a\nvery great load by means of a few hands. Again, if the tongue of an iron\nlever is placed under a weight, and its head is not pushed down, but, on\nthe contrary, is heaved up, the tongue, supported on the surface of the\nground, will treat that as the weight, and the edge of the weight itself\nas the fulcrum. Thus, not so easily as by pushing down, but by motion in\nthe opposite direction, the weight of the load will nevertheless be\nraised. If, therefore, the tongue of a lever lying on a fulcrum goes too\nfar under the weight, and its head exerts its pressure too near the\ncentre, it will not be able to elevate the weight, nor can it do so\nunless, as described above, the length of the lever is brought to\nequilibrium by the depression of its head.\n4. This may be seen from the balances that we call steelyards. When the\nhandle is set as a centre close to the end from which the scale hangs,\nand the counterpoise is moved along towards the other arm of the beam,\nshifting from point to point as it goes farther or even reaches the\nextremity, a small and inferior weight becomes equal to a very heavy\nobject that is being weighed, on account of the equilibrium that is due\nto the levelling of the beam. Thus, as it withdraws from the centre, a\nsmall and comparatively light counterpoise, slowly turning the scale,\nmakes a greater amount of weight rise gently upwards from below.\n5. So, too, the pilot of the biggest merchantman, grasping the steering\noar by its handle, which the Greeks call [Greek: oiax], and with one\nhand bringing it to the turning point, according to the rules of his\nart, by pressure about a centre, can turn the ship, although she may be\nladen with a very large or even enormous burden of merchandise and\nprovisions. And when her sails are set only halfway up the mast, a ship\ncannot run quickly; but when the yard is hoisted to the top, she makes\nmuch quicker progress, because then the sails get the wind, not when\nthey are too close to the heel of the mast, which represents the\ncentre, but when they have moved farther away from it to the top.\n6. As a lever thrust under a weight is harder to manage, and does not\nput forth its strength, if the pressure is exerted at the centre, but\neasily raises the weight when the extreme end of it is pushed down, so\nsails that are only halfway up have less effect, but when they get\nfarther away from the centre, and are hoisted to the very top of the\nmast, the pressure at the top forces the ship to make greater progress,\nthough the wind is no stronger but just the same. Again, take the case\nof oars, which are fastened to the tholes by loops,--when they are\npushed forward and drawn back by the hand, if the ends of the blades are\nat some distance from the centre, the oars foam with the waves of the\nsea and drive the ship forward in a straight line with a mighty impulse,\nwhile her prow cuts through the rare water.\n7. And when the heaviest burdens are carried on poles by four or six\nporters at a time, they find the centres of balance at the very middle\nof the poles, so that, by distributing the dead weight of the burden\naccording to a definitely proportioned division, each labourer may have\nan equal share to carry on his neck. For the poles, from which the\nstraps for the burden of the four porters hang, are marked off at their\ncentres by nails, to prevent the straps from slipping to one side. If\nthey shift beyond the mark at the centre, they weigh heavily upon the\nplace to which they have come nearer, like the weight of a steelyard\nwhen it moves from the point of equilibrium towards the end of the\nweighing apparatus.\n8. In the same way, oxen have an equal draught when their yoke is\nadjusted at its middle by the yokestrap to the pole. But when their\nstrength is not the same, and the stronger outdoes the other, the strap\nis shifted so as to make one side of the yoke longer, which helps the\nweaker ox. Thus, in the case of both poles and yokes, when the straps\nare not fastened at the middle, but at one side, the farther the strap\nmoves from the middle, the shorter it makes one side, and the longer the\nother. So, if both ends are carried round in circles, using as a centre\nthe point to which the strap has been brought, the longer end will\ndescribe a larger, and the shorter end a smaller circle.\n9. Just as smaller wheels move harder and with greater difficulty than\nlarger ones, so, in the case of the poles and yokes, the parts where the\ninterval from centre to end is less, bear down hard upon the neck, but\nwhere the distance from the same centre is greater, they ease the burden\nboth for draught and carriage. As in all these cases motion is obtained\nby means of right lines at the centre and by circles, so also farm\nwaggons, travelling carriages, drums, mills, screws, scorpiones,\nballistae, pressbeams, and all other machines, produce the results\nintended, on the same principles, by turning about a rectilinear axis\nand by the revolution of a circle.\nCHAPTER IV\nENGINES FOR RAISING WATER\n1. I shall now explain the making of the different kinds of engines\nwhich have been invented for raising water, and will first speak of the\ntympanum. Although it does not lift the water high, it raises a great\nquantity very quickly. An axle is fashioned on a lathe or with the\ncompasses, its ends are shod with iron hoops, and it carries round its\nmiddle a tympanum made of boards joined together. It rests on posts\nwhich have pieces of iron on them under the ends of the axle. In the\ninterior of this tympanum there are eight crosspieces set at intervals,\nextending from the axle to the circumference of the tympanum, and\ndividing the space in the tympanum into equal compartments.\n2. Planks are nailed round the face of it, leaving six-inch apertures to\nadmit the water. At one side of it there are also holes, like those of a\ndovecot, next to the axle, one for each compartment. After being smeared\nwith pitch like a ship, the thing is turned by the tread of men, and\nraising the water by means of the apertures in the face of the tympanum,\ndelivers it through the holes next to the axle into a wooden trough set\nunderneath, with a conduit joined to it. Thus, a large quantity of water\nis furnished for irrigation in gardens, or for supplying the needs of\nsaltworks.\n3. But when it has to be raised higher, the same principle will be\nmodified as follows. A wheel on an axle is to be made, large enough to\nreach the necessary height. All round the circumference of the wheel\nthere will be cubical boxes, made tight with pitch and wax. So, when the\nwheel is turned by treading, the boxes, carried up full and again\nreturning to the bottom, will of themselves discharge into the reservoir\nwhat they have carried up.\n4. But, if it has to be supplied to a place still more high, a double\niron chain, which will reach the surface when let down, is passed round\nthe axle of the same wheel, with bronze buckets attached to it, each\nholding about six pints. The turning of the wheel, winding the chain\nround the axle, will carry the buckets to the top, and as they pass\nabove the axle they must tip over and deliver into the reservoir what\nthey have carried up.\nCHAPTER V\nWATER WHEELS AND WATER MILLS\n1. Wheels on the principles that have been described above are also\nconstructed in rivers. Round their faces floatboards are fixed, which,\non being struck by the current of the river, make the wheel turn as they\nmove, and thus, by raising the water in the boxes and bringing it to the\ntop, they accomplish the necessary work through being turned by the mere\nimpulse of the river, without any treading on the part of workmen.\n2. Water mills are turned on the same principle. Everything is the same\nin them, except that a drum with teeth is fixed into one end of the\naxle. It is set vertically on its edge, and turns in the same plane with\nthe wheel. Next to this larger drum there is a smaller one, also with\nteeth, but set horizontally, and this is attached (to the millstone).\nThus the teeth of the drum which is fixed to the axle make the teeth of\nthe horizontal drum move, and cause the mill to turn. A hopper, hanging\nover this contrivance, supplies the mill with corn, and meal is produced\nby the same revolution.\nCHAPTER VI\nTHE WATER SCREW\n1. There is also the method of the screw, which raises a great quantity\nof water, but does not carry it as high as does the wheel. The method of\nconstructing it is as follows. A beam is selected, the thickness of\nwhich in digits is equivalent to its length in feet. This is made\nperfectly round. The ends are to be divided off on their circumference\nwith the compass into eight parts, by quadrants and octants, and let the\nlines be so placed that, if the beam is laid in a horizontal position,\nthe lines on the two ends may perfectly correspond with each other, and\nintervals of the size of one eighth part of the circumference of the\nbeam may be laid off on the length of it. Then, placing the beam in a\nhorizontal position, let perfectly straight lines be drawn from one end\nto the other. So the intervals will be equal in the directions both of\nthe periphery and of the length. Where the lines are drawn along the\nlength, the cutting circles will make intersections, and definite points\nat the intersections.\n[Illustration: CONSTRUCTION OF THE WATER SCREW]\n[Illustration: THE WATER SCREW\n(From the edition of Vitruvius by Fra Giocondo, Venice, 1511)]\n2. When these lines have been correctly drawn, a slender withe of\nwillow, or a straight piece cut from the agnus castus tree, is taken,\nsmeared with liquid pitch, and fastened at the first point of\nintersection. Then it is carried across obliquely to the succeeding\nintersections of longitudinal lines and circles, and as it advances,\npassing each of the points in due order and winding round, it is\nfastened at each intersection; and so, withdrawing from the first to the\neighth point, it reaches and is fastened to the line to which its first\npart was fastened. Thus, it makes as much progress in its longitudinal\nadvance to the eighth point as in its oblique advance over eight\npoints. In the same manner, withes for the eight divisions of the\ndiameter, fastened obliquely at the intersections on the entire\nlongitudinal and peripheral surface, make spiral channels which\nnaturally look just like those of a snail shell.\n3. Other withes are fastened on the line of the first, and on these\nstill others, all smeared with liquid pitch, and built up until the\ntotal diameter is equal to one eighth of the length. These are covered\nand surrounded with boards, fastened on to protect the spiral. Then\nthese boards are soaked with pitch, and bound together with strips of\niron, so that they may not be separated by the pressure of the water.\nThe ends of the shaft are covered with iron. To the right and left of\nthe screw are beams, with crosspieces fastening them together at both\nends. In these crosspieces are holes sheathed with iron, and into them\npivots are introduced, and thus the screw is turned by the treading of\nmen.\n4. It is to be set up at an inclination corresponding to that which is\nproduced in drawing the Pythagorean right-angled triangle: that is, let\nits length be divided into five parts; let three of them denote the\nheight of the head of the screw; thus the distance from the base of the\nperpendicular to the nozzle of the screw at the bottom will be equal to\nfour of those parts. A figure showing how this ought to be, has been\ndrawn at the end of the book, right on the back.\nI have now described as clearly as I could, to make them better known,\nthe principles on which wooden engines for raising water are\nconstructed, and how they get their motion so that they may be of\nunlimited usefulness through their revolutions.\nCHAPTER VII\nTHE PUMP OF CTESIBIUS\n1. Next I must tell about the machine of Ctesibius, which raises water\nto a height. It is made of bronze, and has at the bottom a pair of\ncylinders set a little way apart, and there is a pipe connected with\neach, the two running up, like the prongs of a fork, side by side to a\nvessel which is between the cylinders. In this vessel are valves,\naccurately fitting over the upper vents of the pipes, which stop up the\nventholes, and keep what has been forced by pressure into the vessel\nfrom going down again.\n2. Over the vessel a cowl is adjusted, like an inverted funnel, and\nfastened to the vessel by means of a wedge thrust through a staple, to\nprevent it from being lifted off by the pressure of the water that is\nforced in. On top of this a pipe is jointed, called the trumpet, which\nstands up vertically. Valves are inserted in the cylinders, beneath the\nlower vents of the pipes, and over the openings which are in the bottoms\nof the cylinders.\n3. Pistons smoothly turned, rubbed with oil, and inserted from above\ninto the cylinders, work with their rods and levers upon the air and\nwater in the cylinders, and, as the valves stop up the openings, force\nand drive the water, by repeated pressure and expansion, through the\nvents of the pipes into the vessel, from which the cowl receives the\ninflated currents, and sends them up through the pipe at the top; and so\nwater can be supplied for a fountain from a reservoir at a lower level.\n4. This, however, is not the only apparatus which Ctesibius is said to\nhave thought out, but many more of various kinds are shown by him to\nproduce effects, borrowed from nature, by means of water pressure and\ncompression of the air; as, for example, blackbirds singing by means of\nwaterworks, and \"angobatae,\" and figures that drink and move, and other\nthings that are found to be pleasing to the eye and the ear.\n5. Of these I have selected what I considered most useful and necessary,\nand have thought it best to speak in the preceding book about\ntimepieces, and in this about the methods of raising water. The rest,\nwhich are not subservient to our needs, but to pleasure and amusement,\nmay be found in the commentaries of Ctesibius himself by any who are\ninterested in such refinements.\nCHAPTER VIII\nTHE WATER ORGAN\n1. With regard to water organs, however, I shall not fail with all\npossible brevity and precision to touch upon their principles, and to\ngive a sufficient description of them. A wooden base is constructed, and\non it is set an altar-shaped box made of bronze. Uprights, fastened\ntogether like ladders, are set up on the base, to the right and to the\nleft (of the altar). They hold the bronze pump-cylinders, the moveable\nbottoms of which, carefully turned on a lathe, have iron elbows fastened\nto their centres and jointed to levers, and are wrapped in fleeces of\nwool. In the tops of the cylinders are openings, each about three digits\nin diameter. Close to these openings are bronze dolphins, mounted on\njoints and holding chains in their mouths, from which hang cymbal-shaped\nvalves, let down under the openings in the cylinders.\n2. Inside the altar, which holds the water, is a regulator shaped like\nan inverted funnel, under which there are cubes, each about three digits\nhigh, keeping a free space below between the lips of the regulator and\nthe bottom of the altar. Tightly fixed on the neck of the regulator is\nthe windchest, which supports the principal part of the contrivance,\ncalled in Greek the [Greek: kan\u00f4n mousikos]. Running longitudinally,\nthere are four channels in it if it is a tetrachord; six, if it is a\nhexachord; eight, if it is an octachord.\n3. Each of the channels has a cock in it, furnished with an iron handle.\nThese handles, when turned, open ventholes from the windchest into the\nchannels. From the channels to the canon there are vertical openings\ncorresponding to ventholes in a board above, which board is termed\n[Greek: pinax] in Greek. Between this board and the canon are inserted\nsliders, pierced with holes to correspond, and rubbed with oil so that\nthey can be easily moved and slid back into place again. They close the\nabove-mentioned openings, and are called the plinths. Their going and\ncoming now closes and now opens the holes.\n4. These sliders have iron jacks fixed to them, and connected with the\nkeys, and the keys, when touched, make the sliders move regularly. To\nthe upper surface of the openings in the board, where the wind finds\negress from the channels, rings are soldered, and into them the reeds of\nall the organ pipes are inserted. From the cylinders there are\nconnecting pipes attached to the neck of the regulator, and directed\ntowards the ventholes in the windchest. In the pipes are valves, turned\non a lathe, and set (where the pipes are connected with the cylinders).\nWhen the windchest has received the air, these valves will stop up the\nopenings, and prevent the wind from coming back again.\n5. So, when the levers are raised, the elbows draw down the bottoms of\nthe cylinders as far as they can go; and the dolphins, which are mounted\non joints, let the cymbals fall into the cylinders, thus filling the\ninteriors with air. Then the elbows, raising the bottoms within the\ncylinders by repeated and violent blows, and stopping the openings above\nby means of the cymbals, compress the air which is enclosed in the\ncylinders, and force it into the pipes, through which it runs into the\nregulator, and through its neck into the windchest. With a stronger\nmotion of the levers, the air is still more compressed, streams through\nthe apertures of the cocks, and fills the channels with wind.\n6. So, when the keys, touched by the hand, drive the sliders forward and\ndraw them back regularly, alternately stopping and opening the holes,\nthey produce resonant sounds in a great variety of melodies conforming\nto the laws of music.\nWith my best efforts I have striven to set forth an obscure subject\nclearly in writing, but the theory of it is not easy, nor readily\nunderstood by all, save only those who have had some practice in things\nof this kind. If anybody has failed to understand it, he will certainly\nfind, when he comes to know the thing itself, that it is carefully and\nexquisitely contrived in all respects.\nCHAPTER IX\nTHE HODOMETER\n1. The drift of our treatise now turns to a useful invention of the\ngreatest ingenuity, transmitted by our predecessors, which enables us,\nwhile sitting in a carriage on the road or sailing by sea, to know how\nmany miles of a journey we have accomplished. This will be possible as\nfollows. Let the wheels of the carriage be each four feet in diameter,\nso that if a wheel has a mark made upon it, and begins to move forward\nfrom that mark in making its revolution on the surface of the road, it\nwill have covered the definite distance of twelve and a half feet on\nreaching that mark at which it began to revolve.\n2. Having provided such wheels, let a drum with a single tooth\nprojecting beyond the face of its circumference be firmly fastened to\nthe inner side of the hub of the wheel. Then, above this, let a case be\nfirmly fastened to the body of the carriage, containing a revolving drum\nset on edge and mounted on an axle; on the face of the drum there are\nfour hundred teeth, placed at equal intervals, and engaging the tooth of\nthe drum below. The upper drum has, moreover, one tooth fixed to its\nside and standing out farther than the other teeth.\n3. Then, above, let there be a horizontal drum, similarly toothed and\ncontained in another case, with its teeth engaging the tooth fixed to\nthe side of the second drum, and let as many holes be made in this\n(third) drum as will correspond to the number of miles--more or less, it\ndoes not matter--that a carriage can go in a day's journey. Let a small\nround stone be placed in every one of these holes, and in the receptacle\nor case containing that drum let one hole be made, with a small pipe\nattached, through which, when they reach that point, the stones placed\nin the drum may fall one by one into a bronze vessel set underneath in\nthe body, of the carriage.\n4. Thus, as the wheel in going forward carries with it the lowest drum,\nand as the tooth of this at every revolution strikes against the teeth\nof the upper drum, and makes it move along, the result will be that the\nupper drum is carried round once for every four hundred revolutions of\nthe lowest, and that the tooth fixed to its side pushes forward one\ntooth of the horizontal drum. Since, therefore, with four hundred\nrevolutions of the lowest drum, the upper will revolve once, the\nprogress made will be a distance of five thousand feet or one mile.\nHence, every stone, making a ringing sound as it falls, will give\nwarning that we have gone one mile. The number of stones gathered from\nbeneath and counted, will show the number of miles in the day's journey.\n5. On board ship, also, the same principles may be employed with a few\nchanges. An axle is passed through the sides of the ship, with its ends\nprojecting, and wheels are mounted on them, four feet in diameter, with\nprojecting floatboards fastened round their faces and striking the\nwater. The middle of the axle in the middle of the ship carries a drum\nwith one tooth projecting beyond its circumference. Here a case is\nplaced containing a drum with four hundred teeth at regular intervals,\nengaging the tooth of the drum that is mounted on the axle, and having\nalso one other tooth fixed to its side and projecting beyond its\ncircumference.\n6. Above, in another case fastened to the former, is a horizontal drum\ntoothed in the same way, and with its teeth engaging the tooth fixed to\nthe side of the drum that is set on edge, so that one of the teeth of\nthe horizontal drum is struck at each revolution of that tooth, and the\nhorizontal drum is thus made to revolve in a circle. Let holes be made\nin the horizontal drum, in which holes small round stones are to be\nplaced. In the receptacle or case containing that drum, let one hole be\nopened with a small pipe attached, through which a stone, as soon as the\nobstruction is removed, falls with a ringing sound into a bronze vessel.\n7. So, when a ship is making headway, whether under oars or under a gale\nof wind, the floatboards on the wheels will strike against the water and\nbe driven violently back, thus turning the wheels; and they, revolving,\nwill move the axle, and the axle the drum, the tooth of which, as it\ngoes round, strikes one of the teeth of the second drum at each\nrevolution, and makes it turn a little. So, when the floatboards have\ncaused the wheels to revolve four hundred times, this drum, having\nturned round once, will strike a tooth of the horizontal drum with the\ntooth that is fixed to its side. Hence, every time the turning of the\nhorizontal drum brings a stone to a hole, it will let the stone out\nthrough the pipe. Thus by the sound and the number, the length of the\nvoyage will be shown in miles.\nI have described how to make things that may be provided for use and\namusement in times that are peaceful and without fear.\nCHAPTER X\nCATAPULTS OR SCORPIONES\n1. I shall next explain the symmetrical principles on which scorpiones\nand ballistae may be constructed, inventions devised for defence against\ndanger, and in the interest of self-preservation.\nThe proportions of these engines are all computed from the given length\nof the arrow which the engine is intended to throw, and the size of the\nholes in the capitals, through which the twisted sinews that hold the\narms are stretched, is one ninth of that length.\n2. The height and breadth of the capital itself must then conform to the\nsize of the holes. The boards at the top and bottom of the capital,\nwhich are called \"peritreti,\" should be in thickness equal to one hole,\nand in breadth to one and three quarters, except at their extremities,\nwhere they equal one hole and a half. The sideposts on the right and\nleft should be four holes high, excluding the tenons, and five twelfths\nof a hole thick; the tenons, half a hole. The distance from a sidepost\nto the hole is one quarter of a hole, and it is also one quarter of a\nhole from the hole to the post in the middle. The breadth of the post\nin the middle is equal to one hole and one eighth, the thickness, to one\nhole.\n3. The opening in the middle post, where the arrow is laid, is equal to\none fourth of the hole. The four surrounding corners should have iron\nplates nailed to their sides and faces, or should be studded with bronze\npins and nails. The pipe, called [Greek: syrigx] in Greek, has a length\nof nineteen holes. The strips, which some term cheeks, nailed at the\nright and left of the pipe, have a length of nineteen holes and a height\nand thickness of one hole. Two other strips, enclosing the windlass, are\nnailed on to these, three holes long and half a hole in breadth. The\ncheek nailed on to them, named the \"bench,\" or by some the \"box,\" and\nmade fast by means of dove-tailed tenons, is one hole thick and seven\ntwelfths of a hole in height. The length of the windlass is equal\nto...[12] holes, the thickness of the windlass to three quarters of a\nhole.\n[Note 12: The dots here and in what follows, indicate lacunae in\nthe manuscripts.]\n4. The latch is seven twelfths of a hole in length and one quarter in\nthickness. So also its socket-piece. The trigger or handle is three\nholes in length and three quarters of a hole in breadth and thickness.\nThe trough in the pipe is sixteen holes in length, one quarter of a hole\nin thickness, and three quarters in height. The base of the standard on\nthe ground is equal to eight holes; the breadth of the standard where it\nis fastened into the plinth is three quarters of a hole, its thickness\ntwo thirds of a hole; the height of the standard up to the tenon is\ntwelve holes, its breadth three quarters of a hole, and its thickness\ntwo thirds. It has three struts, each nine holes in length, half a hole\nin breadth, and five twelfths in thickness. The tenon is one hole in\nlength, and the head of the standard one hole and a half in length.\n5. The antefix has the breadth of a hole and one eighth, and the\nthickness of one hole. The smaller support, which is behind, termed in\nGreek [Greek: antibasis], is eight holes long, three quarters of a hole\nbroad, and two thirds thick. Its prop is twelve holes long, and has the\nsame breadth and thickness as the smaller support just mentioned. Above\nthe smaller support is its socket-piece, or what is called the cushion,\ntwo and a half holes long, one and a half high, and three quarters of a\nhole broad. The windlass cup is two and seven twelfths holes long, two\nthirds of a hole thick, and three quarters broad. The crosspieces with\ntheir tenons have the length of... holes, the breadth of three quarters,\nand the thickness of two thirds of a hole. The length of an arm is seven\nholes, its thickness at its base two thirds of a hole, and at its end\none half a hole; its curvature is equal to two thirds of a hole.\n6. These engines are constructed according to these proportions or with\nadditions or diminutions. For, if the height of the capitals is greater\nthan their width--when they are called \"high-tensioned,\"--something\nshould be taken from the arms, so that the more the tension is weakened\nby height of the capitals, the more the strength of the blow is\nincreased by shortness of the arms. But if the capital is less\nhigh,--when the term \"low-tensioned\" is used,--the arms, on account of\ntheir strength, should be made a little longer, so that they may be\ndrawn easily. Just as it takes four men to raise a load with a lever\nfive feet long, and only two men to lift the same load with a ten-foot\nlever, so the longer the arms, the easier they are to draw, and the\nshorter, the harder.\nI have now spoken of the principles applicable to the parts and\nproportions of catapults.\nCHAPTER XI\nBALLISTAE\n1. Ballistae are constructed on varying principles to produce an\nidentical result. Some are worked by handspikes and windlasses, some by\nblocks and pulleys, others by capstans, others again by means of drums.\nNo ballista, however, is made without regard to the given amount of\nweight of the stone which the engine is intended to throw. Hence their\nprinciple is not easy for everybody, but only for those who have\nknowledge of the geometrical principles employed in calculation and in\nmultiplication.\n2. For the holes made in the capitals through the openings of which are\nstretched the strings made of twisted hair, generally women's, or of\nsinew, are proportionate to the amount of weight in the stone which the\nballista is intended to throw, and to the principle of mass, as in\ncatapults the principle is that of the length of the arrow. Therefore,\nin order that those who do not understand geometry may be prepared\nbeforehand, so as not to be delayed by having to think the matter out at\na moment of peril in war, I will set forth what I myself know by\nexperience can be depended upon, and what I have in part gathered from\nthe rules of my teachers, and wherever Greek weights bear a relation to\nthe measures, I shall reduce and explain them so that they will express\nthe same corresponding relation in our weights.\n3. A ballista intended to throw a two-pound stone will have a hole of\nfive digits in its capital; four pounds, six digits; and six pounds,\nseven digits; ten pounds, eight digits; twenty pounds, ten digits; forty\npounds, twelve and a half digits; sixty pounds, thirteen and a half\ndigits; eighty pounds, fifteen and three quarters digits; one hundred\npounds, one foot and one and a half digits; one hundred and twenty\npounds, one foot and two digits; one hundred and forty pounds, one foot\nand three digits; one hundred and sixty pounds, one foot and a quarter;\none hundred and eighty pounds, one foot and five digits; two hundred\npounds, one foot and six digits; two hundred and forty pounds, one foot\nand seven digits; two hundred and eighty pounds, one foot and a half;\nthree hundred and twenty pounds, one foot and nine digits; three hundred\nand sixty pounds, one foot and ten digits.\n4. Having determined the size of the hole, design the \"scutula,\" termed\nin Greek [Greek: peritr\u00eatos],... holes in length and two and one sixth\nin breadth. Bisect it by a line drawn diagonally from the angles, and\nafter this bisecting bring together the outlines of the figure so that\nit may present a rhomboidal design, reducing it by one sixth of its\nlength and one fourth of its breadth at the (obtuse) angles. In the\npart composed by the curvatures into which the points of the angles run\nout, let the holes be situated, and let the breadth be reduced by one\nsixth; moreover, let the hole be longer than it is broad by the\nthickness of the bolt. After designing the scutula, let its outline be\nworked down to give it a gentle curvature.\n5. It should be given the thickness of seven twelfths of a hole. The\nboxes are two holes (in height), one and three quarters in breadth, two\nthirds of a hole in thickness except the part that is inserted in the\nhole, and at the top one third of a hole in breadth. The sideposts are\nfive holes and two thirds in length, their curvature half a hole, and\ntheir thickness thirty-seven forty-eighths of a hole. In the middle\ntheir breadth is increased as much as it was near the hole in the\ndesign, by the breadth and thickness of... hole; the height by one\nfourth of a hole.\n6. The (inner) strip on the \"table\" has a length of eight holes, a\nbreadth and thickness of half a hole. Its tenons are one hole and one\nsixth long, and one quarter of a hole in thickness. The curvature of\nthis strip is three quarters of a hole. The outer strip has the same\nbreadth and thickness (as the inner), but the length is given by the\nobtuse angle of the design and the breadth of the sidepost at its\ncurvature. The upper strips are to be equal to the lower; the\ncrosspieces of the \"table,\" one half of a hole.\n7. The shafts of the \"ladder\" are thirteen holes in length, one hole in\nthickness; the space between them is one hole and a quarter in breadth,\nand one and one eighth in depth. Let the entire length of the ladder on\nits upper surface--which is the one adjoining the arms and fastened to\nthe table--be divided into five parts. Of these let two parts be given\nto the member which the Greeks call the [Greek: chel\u00f4nion], its breadth\nbeing one and one sixth, its thickness one quarter, and its length\neleven holes and one half; the claw projects half a hole and the\n\"winging\" three sixteenths of a hole. What is at the axis which is\ntermed the... face... the crosspieces of three holes?\n8. The breadth of the inner slips is one quarter of a hole; their\nthickness one sixth. The cover-joint or lid of the chelonium is\ndove-tailed into the shafts of the ladder, and is three sixteenths of a\nhole in breadth and one twelfth in thickness. The thickness of the\nsquare piece on the ladder is three sixteenths of a hole,... the\ndiameter of the round axle will be equal to that of the claw, but at the\npivots seven sixteenths of a hole.\n9. The stays are... holes in length, one quarter of a hole in breadth at\nthe bottom, and one sixth in thickness at the top. The base, termed\n[Greek: eschara], has the length of... holes, and the anti-base of four\nholes; each is one hole in thickness and breadth. A supporter is jointed\non, halfway up, one and one half holes in breadth and thickness. Its\nheight bears no relation to the hole, but will be such as to be\nserviceable. The length of an arm is six holes, its thickness at the\nbase two thirds of a hole, and at the end one half a hole.\nI have now given those symmetrical proportions of ballistae and\ncatapults which I thought most useful. But I shall not omit, so far as I\ncan express it in writing, the method of stretching and tuning their\nstrings of twisted sinew or hair.\nCHAPTER XII\nTHE STRINGING AND TUNING OF CATAPULTS\n1. Beams of very generous length are selected, and upon them are nailed\nsocket-pieces in which windlasses are inserted. Midway along their\nlength the beams are incised and cut away to form framings, and in these\ncuttings the capitals of the catapults are inserted, and prevented by\nwedges from moving when the stretching is going on. Then the bronze\nboxes are inserted into the capitals, and the little iron bolts, which\nthe Greeks call [Greek: epizygides], are put in their places in the\nboxes.\n2. Next, the loops of the strings are put through the holes in the\ncapitals, and passed through to the other side; next, they are put upon\nthe windlasses, and wound round them in order that the strings,\nstretched out taut on them by means of the handspikes, on being struck\nby the hand, may respond with the same sound on both sides. Then they\nare wedged tightly into the holes so that they cannot slacken. So, in\nthe same manner, they are passed through to the other side, and\nstretched taut on the windlasses by means of the handspikes until they\ngive the same sound. Thus with tight wedging, catapults are tuned to the\nproper pitch by musical sense of hearing.\nOn these things I have said what I could. There is left for me, in the\nmatter of sieges, to explain how generals can win victories and cities\nbe defended, by means of machinery.\nCHAPTER XIII\nSIEGE MACHINES\n1. It is related that the battering ram for sieges was originally\ninvented as follows. The Carthaginians pitched their camp for the siege\nof Cadiz. They captured an outwork and attempted to destroy it. But\nhaving no iron implements for its destruction, they took a beam, and,\nraising it with their hands, and driving the end of it repeatedly\nagainst the top of the wall, they threw down the top courses of stones,\nand thus, step by step in regular order, they demolished the entire\nredoubt.\n2. Afterwards a carpenter from Tyre, Bright by name and by nature, was\nled by this invention into setting up a mast from which he hung another\ncrosswise like a steelyard, and so, by swinging it vigorously to and\nfro, he threw down the wall of Cadiz. Geras of Chalcedon was the first\nto make a wooden platform with wheels under it, upon which he\nconstructed a framework of uprights and crosspieces, and within it he\nhung the ram, and covered it with oxhide for the better protection of\nthe men who were stationed in the machine to batter the wall. As the\nmachine made but slow progress, he first gave it the name of the\ntortoise of the ram.\n3. These were the first steps then taken towards that kind of machinery,\nbut afterwards, when Philip, the son of Amyntas, was besieging\nByzantium, it was developed in many varieties and made handier by\nPolyidus the Thessalian. His pupils were Diades and Charias, who served\nwith Alexander. Diades shows in his writings that he invented moveable\ntowers, which he used also to take apart and carry round with the army,\nand likewise the borer, and the scaling machine, by means of which one\ncan cross over to the wall on a level with the top of it, as well as the\ndestroyer called the raven, or by others the crane.\n4. He also employed the ram mounted on wheels, an account of which he\nleft in his writings. As for the tower, he says that the smallest should\nbe not less than sixty cubits in height and seventeen in breadth, but\ndiminishing to one fifth less at the top; the uprights for the tower\nbeing nine inches at the bottom and half a foot at the top. Such a\ntower, he says, ought to be ten stories high, with windows in it on all\nsides.\n5. His larger tower, he adds, was one hundred and twenty cubits high and\ntwenty-three and one half cubits broad, diminishing like the other to\none fifth less; the uprights, one foot at the bottom and six digits at\nthe top. He made this large tower twenty stories high, each story having\na gallery round it, three cubits wide. He covered the towers with\nrawhide to protect them from any kind of missile.\n6. The tortoise of the battering ram was constructed in the same way. It\nhad, however, a base of thirty cubits square, and a height, excluding\nthe pediment, of thirteen cubits; the height of the pediment from its\nbed to its top was seven cubits. Issuing up and above the middle of the\nroof for not less than two cubits was a gable, and on this was reared a\nsmall tower four stories high, in which, on the top floor, scorpiones\nand catapults were set up, and on the lower floors a great quantity of\nwater was stored, to put out any fire that might be thrown on the\ntortoise. Inside of this was set the machinery of the ram, termed in\nGreek [Greek: kriodoch\u00ea], in which was placed a roller, turned on a\nlathe, and the ram, being set on top of this, produced its great\neffects when swung to and fro by means of ropes. It was protected, like\nthe tower, with rawhide.\n7. He explained the principles of the borer as follows: that the machine\nitself resembled the tortoise, but that in the middle it had a pipe\nlying between upright walls, like the pipe usually found in catapults\nand ballistae, fifty cubits in length and one cubit in height, in which\na windlass was set transversely. On the right and left, at the end of\nthe pipe, were two blocks, by means of which the iron-pointed beam,\nwhich lay in the pipe, was moved. There were numerous rollers enclosed\nin the pipe itself under the beam, which made its movements quicker and\nstronger. Numerous arches were erected along the pipe above the beam\nwhich was in it, to hold up the rawhide in which this machine was\nenveloped.\n8. He thought it needless to write about the raven, because he saw that\nthe machine was of no value. With regard to the scaling machine, termed\nin Greek [Greek: epibathra], and the naval contrivances which, as he\nwrote, could be used in boarding ships, I have observed that he merely\npromised with some earnestness to explain their principles, but that he\nhas not done so.\nI have set forth what was written by Diades on machines and their\nconstruction. I shall now set forth the methods which I have learned\nfrom my teachers, and which I myself believe to be useful.\nCHAPTER XIV\nTHE TORTOISE\n1. A tortoise intended for the filling of ditches, and thereby to make\nit possible to reach the wall, is to be made as follows. Let a base,\ntermed in Greek [Greek: eschara], be constructed, with each of its sides\ntwenty-one feet long, and with four crosspieces. Let these be held\ntogether by two others, two thirds of a foot thick and half a foot\nbroad; let the crosspieces be about three feet and a half apart, and\nbeneath and in the spaces between them set the trees, termed in Greek\n[Greek: hamaxopodes], in which the axles of the wheels turn in iron\nhoops. Let the trees be provided with pivots, and also with holes\nthrough which levers are passed to make them turn, so that the tortoise\ncan move forward or back or towards its right or left side, or if\nnecessary obliquely, all by the turning of the trees.\n2. Let two beams be laid on the base, projecting for six feet on each\nside, round the projections of which let two other beams be nailed,\nprojecting seven feet beyond the former, and of the thickness and\nbreadth prescribed in the case of the base. On this framework set up\nposts mortised into it, nine feet high exclusive of their tenons, one\nfoot and a quarter square, and one foot and a half apart. Let the posts\nbe tied together at the top by mortised beams. Over the beams let the\nrafters be set, tied one into another by means of tenons, and carried up\ntwelve feet high. Over the rafters set the square beam by which the\nrafters are bound together.\n3. Let the rafters themselves be held together by bridgings, and covered\nwith boards, preferably of holm oak, or, this failing, of any other\nmaterial which has the greatest strength, except pine or alder. For\nthese woods are weak and easily catch fire. Over the boardings let there\nbe placed wattles very closely woven of thin twigs as fresh as possible.\nLet the entire machine be covered with rawhide sewed together double and\nstuffed with seaweed or straw soaked in vinegar. In this way the blows\nof ballistae and the force of fires will be repelled by them.\nCHAPTER XV\nHEGETOR'S TORTOISE\n[Illustration: HEGETOR'S RAM AND TORTOISE\n1. From a MS. of the sixteenth century (Wescher's Poliorc\u00e9tique des\nGrecs).\n2. From a model made by A. A. Howard.]\n1. There is also another kind of tortoise, which has all the other\ndetails as described above except the rafters, but it has round it a\nparapet and battlements of boards, and eaves sloping downwards, and\nis covered with boards and hides firmly fastened in place. Above this\nlet clay kneaded with hair be spread to such a thickness that fire\ncannot injure the machine. These machines can, if need be, have eight\nwheels, should it be necessary to modify them with reference to the\nnature of the ground. Tortoises, however, which are intended for\nexcavating, termed in Greek [Greek: oryktides], have all the other\ndetails as described above, but their fronts are constructed like the\nangles of triangles, in order that when missiles are shot against them\nfrom a wall, they may receive the blows not squarely in front, but\nglancing from the sides, and those excavating within may be protected\nwithout danger.\n2. It does not seem to me out of place to set forth the principles on\nwhich Hegetor of Byzantium constructed a tortoise. The length of its\nbase was sixty-three feet, the breadth forty-two. The corner posts, four\nin number, which were set upon this framework, were made of two timbers\neach, and were thirty-six feet high, a foot and a quarter thick, and a\nfoot and a half broad. The base had eight wheels by means of which it\nwas moved about. The height of these wheels was six and three quarters\nfeet, their thickness three feet. Thus constructed of three pieces of\nwood, united by alternate opposite dovetails and bound together by\ncold-drawn iron plates, they revolved in the trees or amaxopodes.\n3. Likewise, on the plane of the crossbeams above the base, were erected\nposts eighteen feet high, three quarters of a foot broad, two thirds of\na foot thick, and a foot and three quarters apart; above these, framed\nbeams, a foot broad and three quarters of a foot thick, held the whole\nstructure together; above this the rafters were raised, with an\nelevation of twelve feet; a beam set above the rafters united their\njoinings. They also had bridgings fastened transversely, and a flooring\nlaid on them protected the parts beneath.\n4. It had, moreover, a middle flooring on girts, where scorpiones and\ncatapults were placed. There were set up, also, two framed uprights\nforty-five feet long, a foot and a half in thickness, and three quarters\nof a foot in breadth, joined at the tops by a mortised crossbeam and by\nanother, halfway up, mortised into the two shafts and tied in place by\niron plates. Above this was set, between the shafts and the crossbeams,\na block pierced on either side by sockets, and firmly fastened in place\nwith clamps. In this block were two axles, turned on a lathe, and ropes\nfastened from them held the ram.\n5. Over the head of these (ropes) which held the ram, was placed a\nparapet fitted out like a small tower, so that, without danger, two\nsoldiers, standing in safety, could look out and report what the enemy\nwere attempting. The entire ram had a length of one hundred and eighty\nfeet, a breadth at the base of a foot and a quarter, and a thickness of\na foot, tapering at the head to a breadth of a foot and a thickness of\nthree quarters of a foot.\n6. This ram, moreover, had a beak of hard iron such as ships of war\nusually have, and from the beak iron plates, four in number, about\nfifteen feet long, were fastened to the wood. From the head to the very\nheel of the beam were stretched cables, three in number and eight digits\nthick, fastened just as in a ship from stem to stern continuously, and\nthese cables were bound with cross girdles a foot and a quarter apart.\nOver these the whole ram was wrapped with rawhide. The ends of the ropes\nfrom which the ram hung were made of fourfold chains of iron, and these\nchains were themselves wrapped in rawhide.\n7. Likewise, the projecting end of the ram had a box framed and\nconstructed of boards, in which was stretched a net made of rather large\nropes, over the rough surfaces of which one easily reached the wall\nwithout the feet slipping. And this machine moved in six directions,\nforward (and backward), also to the right or left, and likewise it was\nelevated by extending it upwards and depressed by inclining it\ndownwards. The machine could be elevated to a height sufficient to throw\ndown a wall of about one hundred feet, and likewise in its thrust it\ncovered a space from right to left of not less than one hundred feet.\nOne hundred men controlled it, though it had a weight of four thousand\ntalents, which is four hundred and eighty thousand pounds.\nCHAPTER XVI\nMEASURES OF DEFENCE\n1. With regard to scorpiones, catapults, and ballistae, likewise with\nregard to tortoises and towers, I have set forth, as seemed to me\nespecially appropriate, both by whom they were invented and in what\nmanner they should be constructed. But I have not considered it as\nnecessary to describe ladders, cranes, and other things, the principles\nof which are simpler, for the soldiers usually construct these by\nthemselves, nor can these very machines be useful in all places nor in\nthe same way, since fortifications differ from each other, and so also\nthe bravery of nations. For siege works against bold and venturesome men\nshould be constructed on one plan, on another against cautious men, and\non still another against the cowardly.\n2. And so, if any one pays attention to these directions, and by\nselection adapts their various principles to a single structure, he will\nnot be in need of further aids, but will be able, without hesitation, to\ndesign such machines as the circumstances or the situations demand. With\nregard to works of defence, it is not necessary to write, since the\nenemy do not construct their defences in conformity with our books, but\ntheir contrivances are frequently foiled, on the spur of the moment, by\nsome shrewd, hastily conceived plan, without the aid of machines, as is\nsaid to have been the experience of the Rhodians.\n3. For Diognetus was a Rhodian architect, to whom, as an honour, was\ngranted out of the public treasury a fixed annual payment commensurate\nwith the dignity of his art. At this time an architect from Aradus,\nCallias by name, coming to Rhodes, gave a public lecture, and showed a\nmodel of a wall, over which he set a machine on a revolving crane with\nwhich he seized an helepolis as it approached the fortifications, and\nbrought it inside the wall. The Rhodians, when they had seen this model,\nfilled with admiration, took from Diognetus the yearly grant and\ntransferred this honour to Callias.\n4. Meanwhile, king Demetrius, who because of his stubborn courage was\ncalled Poliorcetes, making war on Rhodes, brought with him a famous\nAthenian architect named Epimachus. He constructed at enormous expense,\nwith the utmost care and exertion, an helepolis one hundred and\nthirty-five feet high and sixty feet broad. He strengthened it with hair\nand rawhide so that it could withstand the blow of a stone weighing\nthree hundred and sixty pounds shot from a ballista; the machine itself\nweighed three hundred and sixty thousand pounds. When Callias was asked\nby the Rhodians to construct a machine to resist this helepolis, and to\nbring it within the wall as he had promised, he said that it was\nimpossible.\n5. For not all things are practicable on identical principles, but there\nare some things which, when enlarged in imitation of small models, are\neffective, others cannot have models, but are constructed independently\nof them, while there are some which appear feasible in models, but when\nthey have begun to increase in size are impracticable, as we can observe\nin the following instance. A half inch, inch, or inch and a half hole is\nbored with an auger, but if we should wish, in the same manner, to bore\na hole a quarter of a foot in breadth, it is impracticable, while one of\nhalf a foot or more seems not even conceivable.\n6. So too, in some models it is seen how they appear practicable on the\nsmallest scale and likewise on a larger. And so the Rhodians, in the\nsame manner, deceived by the same reasoning, inflicted injury and insult\non Diognetus. Therefore, when they saw the enemy stubbornly hostile,\nslavery threatening them because of the machine which had been built to\ntake the city, and that they must look forward to the destruction of\ntheir state, they fell at the feet of Diognetus, begging him to come to\nthe aid of the fatherland. He at first refused.\n7. But after free-born maidens and young men came with the priests to\nimplore him, he promised to do it on condition that if he took the\nmachine it should be his property. When these terms had been agreed\nupon, he pierced the wall in the place where the machine was going to\napproach it, and ordered all to bring forth from both public and private\nsources all the water, excrement, and filth, and to pour it in front of\nthe wall through pipes projecting through this opening. After a great\namount of water, filth, and excrement had been poured out during the\nnight, on the next day the helepolis moving up, before it could reach\nthe wall, came to a stop in the swamp made by the moisture, and could\nnot be moved forwards, nor later even backwards. And so Demetrius, when\nhe saw that he had been baffled by the wisdom of Diognetus, withdrew\nwith his fleet.\n8. Then the Rhodians, freed from the war by the cunning of Diognetus,\nthanked him publicly, and decorated him with all honours and\ndistinctions. Diognetus brought that helepolis into the city, set it up\nin a public place, and put on it an inscription: \"Diognetus out of the\nspoils of the enemy dedicated this gift to the people.\" Therefore, in\nworks of defence, not merely machines, but, most of all, wise plans must\nbe prepared.\n9. Likewise at Chios, when the enemy had prepared storming bridges on\ntheir ships, the Chians, by night, carried out earth, sand, and stones\ninto the sea before their walls. So, when the enemy, on the next day,\ntried to approach the walls, their ships grounded on the mound beneath\nthe water, and could not approach the wall nor withdraw, but pierced\nwith fire-darts were burned there. Again, when Apollonia was being\nbesieged, and the enemy were thinking, by digging mines, to make their\nway within the walls without exciting suspicion, and this was reported\nby scouts to the people of Apollonia, they were much disturbed and\nalarmed by the news, and having no plans for defence, they lost courage,\nbecause they could not learn either the time or the definite place where\nthe enemy would come out.\n10. But at this time Trypho, the Alexandrine architect, was there. He\nplanned a number of countermines inside the wall, and extending them\noutside the wall beyond the range of arrows, hung up in all of them\nbrazen vessels. The brazen vessels hanging in one of these mines, which\nwas in front of a mine of the enemy, began to ring from the strokes of\ntheir iron tools. So from this it was ascertained where the enemy,\npushing their mines, thought to enter. The line being thus found out, he\nprepared kettles of hot water, pitch, human excrement, and sand heated\nto a glow. Then, at night, he pierced a number of holes, and pouring the\nmixture suddenly through them, killed all the enemy who were engaged in\nthis work.\n11. In the same manner, when Marseilles was being besieged, and they\nwere pushing forward more than thirty mines, the people of Marseilles,\ndistrusting the entire moat in front of their wall, lowered it by\ndigging it deeper. Thus all the mines found their outlet in the moat. In\nplaces where the moat could not be dug they constructed, within the\nwalls, a basin of enormous length and breadth, like a fish pond, in\nfront of the place where the mines were being pushed, and filled it from\nwells and from the port. And so, when the passages of the mine were\nsuddenly opened, the immense mass of water let in undermined the\nsupports, and all who were within were overpowered by the mass of water\nand the caving in of the mine.\n12. Again, when a rampart was being prepared against the wall in front\nof them, and the place was heaped up with felled trees and works placed\nthere, by shooting at it with the ballistae red-hot iron bolts they set\nthe whole work on fire. And when a ram-tortoise had approached to batter\ndown the wall, they let down a noose, and when they had caught the ram\nwith it, winding it over a drum by turning a capstan, having raised the\nhead of the ram, they did not allow the wall to be touched, and finally\nthey destroyed the entire machine by glowing fire-darts and the blows of\nballistae. Thus by such victory, not by machines but in opposition to\nthe principle of machines, has the freedom of states been preserved by\nthe cunning of architects.\nSuch principles of machines as I could make clear, and as I thought most\nserviceable for times of peace and of war, I have explained in this\nbook. In the nine earlier books I have dealt with single topics and\ndetails, so that the entire work contains all the branches of\narchitecture, set forth in ten books.\nFINIS\n*       *       *       *       *\nSCAMILLI IMPARES (BOOK III, ch. 4)\nNo passage in Vitruvius has given rise to so much discussion or\nbeen the subject of such various interpretations as this phrase.\nThe most reasonable explanation of its meaning seems to be that of\n\u00c9mile Burnouf, at one time Director of the French School at Athens,\npublished in the _Revue G\u00e9n\u00e9rale del' Architecture_ for 1875, as a\nnote to a brief article of his on the explanation of the curves of\nGreek Doric buildings. This explanation was accepted by Professor\nMorgan, who called my attention to it in a note dated December 12,\n1905. It has also quite recently been adopted by Professor Goodyear\nin his interesting book on _Greek Refinements_.\nBurnouf would translate it _nivelettes in\u00e9gales_, \"unequal\nlevellers.\" He states that in many parts of France in setting a\nlong course of cut stone the masons make use of a simple device\nconsisting of three pointed blocks of equal height used as\nlevellers, of which two are placed one at each extremity of the\ncourse, while the third is used to level the stones, as they are\nsuccessively set in place, by setting it upon the stone to be set\nand sighting across the other two levellers. If two \"levellers\" of\nequal height are used with a third of less height placed at the\ncentre of the course, with perhaps others of intermediate height\nused at intermediate points, it would obviously be equally easy to\nset out a curved course, as, for instance, the curved stylobate of\nthe Parthenon which rises about three inches in its length of one\nhundred feet. By a simple calculation any desired curve could be\nlaid out in this way. The word scamillus is a diminutive of\n_scamnum_, a mounting-block or bench.\nPractically the same explanation is given by G. Georges in a memoir\nsubmitted to the Sorbonne in April, 1875. Georges adds an\ninteresting list, by no means complete, of the various explanations\nthat have been offered at different times.\nPhilander (1522-1552). Projections of the stylobate or pedestals.\nBarbaro (1556-1690).   The same.\nBertano (1558).        Swellings of the die of the stylobate or bosses\nin the stylobate or the frieze of the\nentablature.\nBaldus (1612).         Sub-plinths placed under the bases of the columns.\nPerrault (1673-1684).  Projection of the stylobate.\nPolleni (1739).        The same.\nGaliani (1758-1790).   Projection of the stylobate with hypothesis of\nembossments on the stylobates and the bases of\nthe columns.\nTardieu and Coussin (1837) and Mauffras (1847). Projection of the stylobates.\nAur\u00e8s (1865).          Steps or offsets between the stylobate and the columns.\nThe list of Georges is wholly French and Italian.\nFra Giocondo's interpretation is indicated in our reproduction of\nthe illustration in his edition of 1511.\nHoffer (1838) and afterwards Pennethorne (1846) and Penrose (1851)\ngave measurements showing the curvatures in the Parthenon and the\ntemple of Theseus in Athens. Penrose and most writers who followed\nhim supposed the \"scamilli impares\" to be projections or offsets on\nthe stylobate required on account of the curves to bring the column\ninto relation with the architraves above, and similar offsets of\nunequal or sloping form were supposed to be required above the\nabaci of the capitals, but such offsets, although sometimes\nexisting, have no obvious connection with the passage in Vitruvius.\nC. B\u00f6tticher (1863) and more recently Durm have denied the original\nintention of the curves and ascribe them to settlement, a\nsupposition which hardly accords with the observed facts. Reber, in\nthe note on this passage in his translation of Vitruvius (1865),\nthinks the scamilli were sloping offsets on the stylobate to cause\nthe inclination of the columns, but admits that nothing of the kind\nhas been found in the remains so far examined. It may be added that\nthis is at variance with the statement of the purpose of the\nscamilli which Vitruvius gives.\nAssuming, as I think we must, that the horizontal curvature of the\nstylobate in such buildings as the Parthenon was intended and\ncarefully planned, Burnouf's explanation fits the case precisely\nand makes this passage of Vitruvius straightforward and simple.\nThis can be said of no other explanation, for all the others leave\nthe passage obscure and more or less nonsensical. Durm's attempt to\nrefer the passage to the case of the temple with a podium which has\njust been spoken of by Vitruvius is somewhat forced, or at least\nunnecessary. Clearly the passage refers to stylobates in general;\nbut Reber also so translates and punctuates as to make the use of\nthe \"scamilli impares\" refer only to the case of temples built in\nthe Roman manner with the podium. His resulting explanation still\nleaves the passage obscure and unsatisfactory. One may finally\nrefer to the ingenious but improbable explanation of Choisy, who\ntranslates it echelons impairs, and explains them as offsets\narranged according to the odd numbers, _nombres impairs_, i. e.,\noffsets varying at equal intervals in the proportion of 1, 3, 5, 7,\n9, etc., and which he claims was applied also to the entasis of\ncolumns.\nH.
