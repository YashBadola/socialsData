Diapsalmata

What is a poet? An unhappy man who in his heart harbors a deep anguish, but whose lips are so fashioned that the sighs and cries which pass over them are transformed into ravishing music. His fate is like that of the unfortunate victims whom the tyrant Phalaris imprisoned in a brazen bull, and slowly tortured over a steady fire; their cries could not reach the tyrant’s ears so as to strike terror into his heart; when they reached him they sounded like sweet music.

I have just now come from a party where I was its life and soul; witticisms streamed from my lips, everyone laughed and admired me, but I went away — yes, the dash should be as long as the radius of the earth's orbit ——————————— and wanted to shoot myself.

My sorrow is my castle, which like an eagle's eyrie is built high up on the mountain peak among the clouds. No one can storm it. From it I fly down into reality to seize my prey; but I do not remain down there, I bring my booty home. And this booty is a picture I weave into the tapestries at my palace. There I live as a dead man. I immerse everything I have experienced in a baptism of oblivion unto an eternal remembrance. Everything temporal and contingent is forgotten and erased. Then I sit like an old man, grey-haired and thoughtful, and explain the pictures in a soft voice, almost whispering, and at my side a child sits and listens, although he remembers everything before I tell it.
