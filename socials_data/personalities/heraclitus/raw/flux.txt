You cannot step twice into the same rivers; for fresh waters are ever flowing in upon you.
We step and do not step into the same rivers; we are and are not.
Men do not know how what is at variance agrees with itself. It is an attunement of opposite tensions, like that of the bow and the lyre.
War is the father of all and the king of all; and some he has made gods and some men, some bond and some free.
The hidden attunement is better than the open.
The straight and the crooked path of the fuller's comb is one and the same.
The way up and the way down is one and the same.
We must know that war is common to all and strife is justice, and that all things come into being and pass away through strife.
It rests by changing.
And it is the same thing in us that is quick and dead, awake and asleep, young and old; the former are shifted and become the latter, and the latter in turn are shifted and become the former.
It scatters and it gathers; it advances and retires.
Cold things become warm, and what is warm cools; what is wet dries, and the parched is moistened.
