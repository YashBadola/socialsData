The Realm of the Individual

What I really lack is to be clear in my mind what I am to do, not what I am to know, except in so far as a certain knowledge must precede every action. The thing is to understand myself, to see what God really wishes me to do; the thing is to find a truth which is true for me, to find the idea for which I can live and die.

The crowd is untruth. There is therefore no one who has more contempt for what it is to be a man than they who make it their profession to lead the crowd.

Anxiety is the Dizziness of Freedom

Anxiety may be compared with dizziness. He whose eye happens to look down the yawning abyss becomes dizzy. But what is the reason for this? It is just as much in his own eye as in the abyss, for suppose he had not looked down. Hence, anxiety is the dizziness of freedom, which emerges when the spirit wants to posit the synthesis and freedom looks down into its own possibility, laying hold of finiteness to support itself. Freedom succumbs in this dizziness.

The Knight of Faith

The Knight of Faith is the only happy man, the heir to the finite while the Knight of Resignation is a stranger and a sojourner. But if I knew where such a knight was to be found, I would make a journey to him on foot, for this prodigy interests me absolutely. I would not let him go for an instant, every moment I would watch to see how he managed to make the movements, I would regard myself as secured for life and would divide my time between looking at him and practicing the exercises myself, and thus would spend all my time admiring him.

Truth is Subjectivity

When the question of truth is raised in an objective manner, reflection is directed objectively to the truth, as an object to which the knower is related. Reflection is not focused upon the relationship, but upon the question of whether it is the truth to which the knower is related. If only the object to which he is related is the truth, the subject is accounted to be in the truth. When the question of the truth is raised subjectively, reflection is directed subjectively to the nature of the individual's relationship; if only the mode of this relationship is in the truth, the individual is in the truth even if he should happen to be thus related to what is not true.

The Leap of Faith

It is not the business of the human understanding to comprehend the Absolute. The Absolute is the paradox. The paradox is the source of the thinker's passion, and the thinker without a paradox is like a lover without feeling: a paltry mediocrity. The supreme paradox of all thought is the attempt to discover something that thought cannot think.

On Despair

Despair is the sickness unto death. It is the disrelationship in a relation which relates itself to itself. Despair is not a result of a flaw in the composition of the synthesis of the self, but of the disrelationship in the relation.

I stick my finger into existence — it smells of nothing. Where am I? Who am I? How came I here? What is this thing called the world? What does this world mean? Who is it that has lured me into the thing and now leaves me there? Who am I? How did I come into the world? Why was I not consulted, why not made acquainted with its manners and customs but was thrust into the ranks as if I had been bought at a kidnapper's, a dealer in souls? How did I obtain an interest in this big enterprise they call reality? Why should I have an interest in it? Is it not a voluntary concern? And if I am compelled to take part in it, where is the director? I have something to remark to him.
