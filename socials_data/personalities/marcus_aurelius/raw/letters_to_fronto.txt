Marcus Aurelius to Fronto.

I have almost got the better of you, my dear Fronto; for I have devoted this day to unmitigated leisure, if that can be called leisure, which I have spent with you, or with no one rather than you; for who would not consider you, and your letters, and the recollection of you, and the thought of you, the highest pleasure? I have read a little of Coelius, and I have written a little of my own; but I have not yet read any of your writings, though I have been turning them over. Farewell, my sweetest of masters.

Marcus Aurelius to Fronto.

If you have any love for me, sleep at the proper time. You have now for the third night been awake. I have no rest for thinking of your want of rest. I would rather be sick myself than that you should be. Farewell, my breath.

Fronto to Marcus Aurelius.

What shall I say? That I love you? That is nothing new. That I long for you? That is nothing new. That I desire to see you? That is nothing new. But this is something new, that I have never written to you before, that I have been three days without writing to you. But I have not been well, my Lord. My health has been the cause of my silence. Now I am well again, and I write to you. I love you, I long for you, I desire to see you. Farewell, my Lord, my glory.

Marcus Aurelius to Fronto.

I have received your letter, my dear Fronto, in which you say that you are well again. I was anxious about you, my master. But now I am happy. I love you, I long for you, I desire to see you. Farewell, my best of masters.

Marcus Aurelius to Fronto.

I have read your speech, my dear Fronto, and I admire it. I have read it again, and I admire it more. I have read it a third time, and I admire it most of all. You have surpassed yourself. Farewell, my eloquence.

Fronto to Marcus Aurelius.

I am delighted that you are pleased with my speech. But I am more delighted that you love me. For to be praised by you is a great thing, but to be loved by you is the greatest thing of all. Farewell, my Lord, my light.

Marcus Aurelius to Fronto.

I have been reading Cato's speech on the property of Pulchra, and another of his speeches in which he recommends that the property of Florus should be given to the public treasury. I have also been reading some of your letters, and I have been thinking of you. Farewell, my dearest Fronto.

Fronto to Marcus Aurelius.

I have sent you the books which you asked for. I hope you will like them. I am busy with my own work, but I am always thinking of you. Farewell, my Lord, my soul.

Marcus Aurelius to Fronto.

I have received the books, and I thank you. I am well, and I am working hard. I hope you are well too. Farewell, my master.

Fronto to Marcus Aurelius.

I am glad to hear that you are well and working hard. I am well too. I am writing a speech on the law of inheritance. It is a difficult subject, but I hope to make it clear. Farewell, my Lord, my hope.

Marcus Aurelius to Fronto.

I am sure you will make it clear. You have a wonderful power of making difficult things easy. I am longing to see you. Farewell, my master.

Fronto to Marcus Aurelius.

I am coming to see you soon. I have finished my speech, and I want to read it to you. Farewell, my Lord, my joy.

Marcus Aurelius to Fronto.

Come as soon as you can. I shall be delighted to see you and to hear your speech. Farewell, my dearest Fronto.
