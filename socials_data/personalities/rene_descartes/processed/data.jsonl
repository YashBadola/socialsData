{"text": "DISCOURSE ON THE METHOD\nOF RIGHTLY CONDUCTING THE REASON,\nAND SEEKING TRUTH IN THE SCIENCES\nby Ren\u00e9 Descartes\nContents\nPREFATORY NOTE\nPART I\nPART II\nPART III\nPART IV\nPART V\nPART VI\nPREFATORY NOTE BY THE AUTHOR\nIf this Discourse appear too long to be read at once, it may be divided\ninto six Parts: and, in the first, will be found various considerations\ntouching the Sciences; in the second, the principal rules of the Method\nwhich the Author has discovered, in the third, certain of the rules of\nMorals which he has deduced from this Method; in the fourth, the\nreasonings by which he establishes the existence of God and of the\nHuman Soul, which are the foundations of his Metaphysic; in the fifth,\nthe order of the Physical questions which he has investigated, and, in\nparticular, the explication of the motion of the heart and of some\nother difficulties pertaining to Medicine, as also the difference\nbetween the soul of man and that of the brutes; and, in the last, what\nthe Author believes to be required in order to greater advancement in\nthe investigation of Nature than has yet been made, with the reasons\nthat have induced him to write.\nPART I\nGood sense is, of all things among men, the most equally distributed;\nfor every one thinks himself so abundantly provided with it, that those\neven who are the most difficult to satisfy in everything else, do not\nusually desire a larger measure of this quality than they already\npossess. And in this it is not likely that all are mistaken the\nconviction is rather to be held as testifying that the power of judging\naright and of distinguishing truth from error, which is properly what\nis called good sense or reason, is by nature equal in all men; and that\nthe diversity of our opinions, consequently, does not arise from some\nbeing endowed with a larger share of reason than others, but solely\nfrom this, that we conduct our thoughts along different ways, and do\nnot fix our attention on the same objects. For to be possessed of a\nvigorous mind is not enough; the prime requisite is rightly to apply\nit. The greatest minds, as they are capable of the highest excellences,\nare open likewise to the greatest aberrations; and those who travel\nvery slowly may yet make far greater progress, provided they keep\nalways to the straight road, than those who, while they run, forsake\nit.\nFor myself, I have never fancied my mind to be in any respect more\nperfect than those of the generality; on the contrary, I have often\nwished that I were equal to some others in promptitude of thought, or\nin clearness and distinctness of imagination, or in fullness and\nreadiness of memory. And besides these, I know of no other qualities\nthat contribute to the perfection of the mind; for as to the reason or\nsense, inasmuch as it is that alone which constitutes us men, and\ndistinguishes us from the brutes, I am disposed to believe that it is\nto be found complete in each individual; and on this point to adopt the\ncommon opinion of philosophers, who say that the difference of greater\nand less holds only among the accidents, and not among the forms or\nnatures of individuals of the same species.\nI will not hesitate, however, to avow my belief that it has been my\nsingular good fortune to have very early in life fallen in with certain\ntracks which have conducted me to considerations and maxims, of which I\nhave formed a method that gives me the means, as I think, of gradually\naugmenting my knowledge, and of raising it by little and little to the\nhighest point which the mediocrity of my talents and the brief duration\nof my life will permit me to reach. For I have already reaped from it\nsuch fruits that, although I have been accustomed to think lowly enough\nof myself, and although when I look with the eye of a philosopher at\nthe varied courses and pursuits of mankind at large, I find scarcely\none which does not appear in vain and useless, I nevertheless derive\nthe highest satisfaction from the progress I conceive myself to have\nalready made in the search after truth, and cannot help entertaining\nsuch expectations of the future as to believe that if, among the\noccupations of men as men, there is any one really excellent and\nimportant, it is that which I have chosen.\nAfter all, it is possible I may be mistaken; and it is but a little\ncopper and glass, perhaps, that I take for gold and diamonds. I know\nhow very liable we are to delusion in what relates to ourselves, and\nalso how much the judgments of our friends are to be suspected when\ngiven in our favor. But I shall endeavor in this discourse to describe\nthe paths I have followed, and to delineate my life as in a picture, in\norder that each one may also be able to judge of them for himself, and\nthat in the general opinion entertained of them, as gathered from\ncurrent report, I myself may have a new help towards instruction to be\nadded to those I have been in the habit of employing.\nMy present design, then, is not to teach the method which each ought to\nfollow for the right conduct of his reason, but solely to describe the\nway in which I have endeavored to conduct my own. They who set\nthemselves to give precepts must of course regard themselves as\npossessed of greater skill than those to whom they prescribe; and if\nthey err in the slightest particular, they subject themselves to\ncensure. But as this tract is put forth merely as a history, or, if you\nwill, as a tale, in which, amid some examples worthy of imitation,\nthere will be found, perhaps, as many more which it were advisable not\nto follow, I hope it will prove useful to some without being hurtful to\nany, and that my openness will find some favor with all.\nFrom my childhood, I have been familiar with letters; and as I was\ngiven to believe that by their help a clear and certain knowledge of\nall that is useful in life might be acquired, I was ardently desirous\nof instruction. But as soon as I had finished the entire course of\nstudy, at the close of which it is customary to be admitted into the\norder of the learned, I completely changed my opinion. For I found\nmyself involved in so many doubts and errors, that I was convinced I\nhad advanced no farther in all my attempts at learning, than the\ndiscovery at every turn of my own ignorance. And yet I was studying in\none of the most celebrated schools in Europe, in which I thought there\nmust be learned men, if such were anywhere to be found. I had been\ntaught all that others learned there; and not contented with the\nsciences actually taught us, I had, in addition, read all the books\nthat had fallen into my hands, treating of such branches as are\nesteemed the most curious and rare. I knew the judgment which others\nhad formed of me; and I did not find that I was considered inferior to\nmy fellows, although there were among them some who were already marked\nout to fill the places of our instructors. And, in fine, our age\nappeared to me as flourishing, and as fertile in powerful minds as any\npreceding one. I was thus led to take the liberty of judging of all\nother men by myself, and of concluding that there was no science in\nexistence that was of such a nature as I had previously been given to\nbelieve.\nI still continued, however, to hold in esteem the studies of the\nschools. I was aware that the languages taught in them are necessary to\nthe understanding of the writings of the ancients; that the grace of\nfable stirs the mind; that the memorable deeds of history elevate it;\nand, if read with discretion, aid in forming the judgment; that the\nperusal of all excellent books is, as it were, to interview with the\nnoblest men of past ages, who have written them, and even a studied\ninterview, in which are discovered to us only their choicest thoughts;\nthat eloquence has incomparable force and beauty; that poesy has its\nravishing graces and delights; that in the mathematics there are many\nrefined discoveries eminently suited to gratify the inquisitive, as\nwell as further all the arts an lessen the labour of man; that numerous\nhighly useful precepts and exhortations to virtue are contained in\ntreatises on morals; that theology points out the path to heaven; that\nphilosophy affords the means of discoursing with an appearance of truth\non all matters, and commands the admiration of the more simple; that\njurisprudence, medicine, and the other sciences, secure for their\ncultivators honors and riches; and, in fine, that it is useful to\nbestow some attention upon all, even upon those abounding the most in\nsuperstition and error, that we may be in a position to determine their\nreal value, and guard against being deceived.\nBut I believed that I had already given sufficient time to languages,\nand likewise to the reading of the writings of the ancients, to their\nhistories and fables. For to hold converse with those of other ages and\nto travel, are almost the same thing. It is useful to know something of\nthe manners of different nations, that we may be enabled to form a more\ncorrect judgment regarding our own, and be prevented from thinking that\neverything contrary to our customs is ridiculous and irrational, a\nconclusion usually come to by those whose experience has been limited\nto their own country. On the other hand, when too much time is occupied\nin traveling, we become strangers to our native country; and the over\ncurious in the customs of the past are generally ignorant of those of\nthe present. Besides, fictitious narratives lead us to imagine the\npossibility of many events that are impossible; and even the most\nfaithful histories, if they do not wholly misrepresent matters, or\nexaggerate their importance to render the account of them more worthy\nof perusal, omit, at least, almost always the meanest and least\nstriking of the attendant circumstances; hence it happens that the\nremainder does not represent the truth, and that such as regulate their\nconduct by examples drawn from this source, are apt to fall into the\nextravagances of the knight-errants of romance, and to entertain\nprojects that exceed their powers.\nI esteemed eloquence highly, and was in raptures with poesy; but I\nthought that both were gifts of nature rather than fruits of study.\nThose in whom the faculty of reason is predominant, and who most\nskillfully dispose their thoughts with a view to render them clear and\nintelligible, are always the best able to persuade others of the truth\nof what they lay down, though they should speak only in the language of\nLower Brittany, and be wholly ignorant of the rules of rhetoric; and\nthose whose minds are stored with the most agreeable fancies, and who\ncan give expression to them with the greatest embellishment and\nharmony, are still the best poets, though unacquainted with the art of\npoetry.\nI was especially delighted with the mathematics, on account of the\ncertitude and evidence of their reasonings; but I had not as yet a\nprecise knowledge of their true use; and thinking that they but\ncontributed to the advancement of the mechanical arts, I was astonished\nthat foundations, so strong and solid, should have had no loftier\nsuperstructure reared on them. On the other hand, I compared the\ndisquisitions of the ancient moralists to very towering and magnificent\npalaces with no better foundation than sand and mud: they laud the\nvirtues very highly, and exhibit them as estimable far above anything\non earth; but they give us no adequate criterion of virtue, and\nfrequently that which they designate with so fine a name is but apathy,\nor pride, or despair, or parricide.\nI revered our theology, and aspired as much as any one to reach heaven:\nbut being given assuredly to understand that the way is not less open\nto the most ignorant than to the most learned, and that the revealed\ntruths which lead to heaven are above our comprehension, I did not\npresume to subject them to the impotency of my reason; and I thought\nthat in order competently to undertake their examination, there was\nneed of some special help from heaven, and of being more than man.\nOf philosophy I will say nothing, except that when I saw that it had\nbeen cultivated for many ages by the most distinguished men, and that\nyet there is not a single matter within its sphere which is not still\nin dispute, and nothing, therefore, which is above doubt, I did not\npresume to anticipate that my success would be greater in it than that\nof others; and further, when I considered the number of conflicting\nopinions touching a single matter that may be upheld by learned men,\nwhile there can be but one true, I reckoned as well-nigh false all that\nwas only probable.\nAs to the other sciences, inasmuch as these borrow their principles\nfrom philosophy, I judged that no solid superstructures could be reared\non foundations so infirm; and neither the honor nor the gain held out\nby them was sufficient to determine me to their cultivation: for I was\nnot, thank Heaven, in a condition which compelled me to make\nmerchandise of science for the bettering of my fortune; and though I\nmight not profess to scorn glory as a cynic, I yet made very slight\naccount of that honor which I hoped to acquire only through fictitious\ntitles. And, in fine, of false sciences I thought I knew the worth\nsufficiently to escape being deceived by the professions of an\nalchemist, the predictions of an astrologer, the impostures of a\nmagician, or by the artifices and boasting of any of those who profess\nto know things of which they are ignorant.\nFor these reasons, as soon as my age permitted me to pass from under\nthe control of my instructors, I entirely abandoned the study of\nletters, and resolved no longer to seek any other science than the\nknowledge of myself, or of the great book of the world. I spent the\nremainder of my youth in traveling, in visiting courts and armies, in\nholding intercourse with men of different dispositions and ranks, in\ncollecting varied experience, in proving myself in the different\nsituations into which fortune threw me, and, above all, in making such\nreflection on the matter of my experience as to secure my improvement.\nFor it occurred to me that I should find much more truth in the\nreasonings of each individual with reference to the affairs in which he\nis personally interested, and the issue of which must presently punish\nhim if he has judged amiss, than in those conducted by a man of letters\nin his study, regarding speculative matters that are of no practical\nmoment, and followed by no consequences to himself, farther, perhaps,\nthan that they foster his vanity the better the more remote they are\nfrom common sense; requiring, as they must in this case, the exercise\nof greater ingenuity and art to render them probable. In addition, I\nhad always a most earnest desire to know how to distinguish the true\nfrom the false, in order that I might be able clearly to discriminate\nthe right path in life, and proceed in it with confidence.\nIt is true that, while busied only in considering the manners of other\nmen, I found here, too, scarce any ground for settled conviction, and\nremarked hardly less contradiction among them than in the opinions of\nthe philosophers. So that the greatest advantage I derived from the\nstudy consisted in this, that, observing many things which, however\nextravagant and ridiculous to our apprehension, are yet by common\nconsent received and approved by other great nations, I learned to\nentertain too decided a belief in regard to nothing of the truth of\nwhich I had been persuaded merely by example and custom; and thus I\ngradually extricated myself from many errors powerful enough to darken\nour natural intelligence, and incapacitate us in great measure from\nlistening to reason. But after I had been occupied several years in\nthus studying the book of the world, and in essaying to gather some\nexperience, I at length resolved to make myself an object of study, and\nto employ all the powers of my mind in choosing the paths I ought to\nfollow, an undertaking which was accompanied with greater success than\nit would have been had I never quitted my country or my books.\nPART II\nI was then in Germany, attracted thither by the wars in that country,\nwhich have not yet been brought to a termination; and as I was\nreturning to the army from the coronation of the emperor, the setting\nin of winter arrested me in a locality where, as I found no society to\ninterest me, and was besides fortunately undisturbed by any cares or\npassions, I remained the whole day in seclusion, with full opportunity\nto occupy my attention with my own thoughts. Of these one of the very\nfirst that occurred to me was, that there is seldom so much perfection\nin works composed of many separate parts, upon which different hands\nhad been employed, as in those completed by a single master. Thus it is\nobservable that the buildings which a single architect has planned and\nexecuted, are generally more elegant and commodious than those which\nseveral have attempted to improve, by making old walls serve for\npurposes for which they were not originally built. Thus also, those\nancient cities which, from being at first only villages, have become,\nin course of time, large towns, are usually but ill laid out compared\nwith the regularity constructed towns which a professional architect\nhas freely planned on an open plain; so that although the several\nbuildings of the former may often equal or surpass in beauty those of\nthe latter, yet when one observes their indiscriminate juxtaposition,\nthere a large one and here a small, and the consequent crookedness and\nirregularity of the streets, one is disposed to allege that chance\nrather than any human will guided by reason must have led to such an\narrangement. And if we consider that nevertheless there have been at\nall times certain officers whose duty it was to see that private\nbuildings contributed to public ornament, the difficulty of reaching\nhigh perfection with but the materials of others to operate on, will be\nreadily acknowledged. In the same way I fancied that those nations\nwhich, starting from a semi-barbarous state and advancing to\ncivilization by slow degrees, have had their laws successively\ndetermined, and, as it were, forced upon them simply by experience of\nthe hurtfulness of particular crimes and disputes, would by this\nprocess come to be possessed of less perfect institutions than those\nwhich, from the commencement of their association as communities, have\nfollowed the appointments of some wise legislator. It is thus quite\ncertain that the constitution of the true religion, the ordinances of\nwhich are derived from God, must be incomparably superior to that of\nevery other. And, to speak of human affairs, I believe that the\npre-eminence of Sparta was due not to the goodness of each of its laws\nin particular, for many of these were very strange, and even opposed to\ngood morals, but to the circumstance that, originated by a single\nindividual, they all tended to a single end. In the same way I thought\nthat the sciences contained in books (such of them at least as are made\nup of probable reasonings, without demonstrations), composed as they\nare of the opinions of many different individuals massed together, are\nfarther removed from truth than the simple inferences which a man of\ngood sense using his natural and unprejudiced judgment draws respecting\nthe matters of his experience. And because we have all to pass through\na state of infancy to manhood, and have been of necessity, for a length\nof time, governed by our desires and preceptors (whose dictates were\nfrequently conflicting, while neither perhaps always counseled us for\nthe best), I farther concluded that it is almost impossible that our\njudgments can be so correct or solid as they would have been, had our\nreason been mature from the moment of our birth, and had we always been\nguided by it alone.\nIt is true, however, that it is not customary to pull down all the\nhouses of a town with the single design of rebuilding them differently,\nand thereby rendering the streets more handsome; but it often happens\nthat a private individual takes down his own with the view of erecting\nit anew, and that people are even sometimes constrained to this when\ntheir houses are in danger of falling from age, or when the foundations\nare insecure. With this before me by way of example, I was persuaded\nthat it would indeed be preposterous for a private individual to think\nof reforming a state by fundamentally changing it throughout, and\noverturning it in order to set it up amended; and the same I thought\nwas true of any similar project for reforming the body of the sciences,\nor the order of teaching them established in the schools: but as for\nthe opinions which up to that time I had embraced, I thought that I\ncould not do better than resolve at once to sweep them wholly away,\nthat I might afterwards be in a position to admit either others more\ncorrect, or even perhaps the same when they had undergone the scrutiny\nof reason. I firmly believed that in this way I should much better\nsucceed in the conduct of my life, than if I built only upon old\nfoundations, and leaned upon principles which, in my youth, I had taken\nupon trust. For although I recognized various difficulties in this\nundertaking, these were not, however, without remedy, nor once to be\ncompared with such as attend the slightest reformation in public\naffairs. Large bodies, if once overthrown, are with great difficulty\nset up again, or even kept erect when once seriously shaken, and the\nfall of such is always disastrous. Then if there are any imperfections\nin the constitutions of states (and that many such exist the diversity\nof constitutions is alone sufficient to assure us), custom has without\ndoubt materially smoothed their inconveniences, and has even managed to\nsteer altogether clear of, or insensibly corrected a number which\nsagacity could not have provided against with equal effect; and, in\nfine, the defects are almost always more tolerable than the change\nnecessary for their removal; in the same manner that highways which\nwind among mountains, by being much frequented, become gradually so\nsmooth and commodious, that it is much better to follow them than to\nseek a straighter path by climbing over the tops of rocks and\ndescending to the bottoms of precipices.\nHence it is that I cannot in any degree approve of those restless and\nbusy meddlers who, called neither by birth nor fortune to take part in\nthe management of public affairs, are yet always projecting reforms;\nand if I thought that this tract contained aught which might justify\nthe suspicion that I was a victim of such folly, I would by no means\npermit its publication. I have never contemplated anything higher than\nthe reformation of my own opinions, and basing them on a foundation\nwholly my own. And although my own satisfaction with my work has led me\nto present here a draft of it, I do not by any means therefore\nrecommend to every one else to make a similar attempt. Those whom God\nhas endowed with a larger measure of genius will entertain, perhaps,\ndesigns still more exalted; but for the many I am much afraid lest even\nthe present undertaking be more than they can safely venture to\nimitate. The single design to strip one\u2019s self of all past beliefs is\none that ought not to be taken by every one. The majority of men is\ncomposed of two classes, for neither of which would this be at all a\nbefitting resolution: in the first place, of those who with more than a\ndue confidence in their own powers, are precipitate in their judgments\nand want the patience requisite for orderly and circumspect thinking;\nwhence it happens, that if men of this class once take the liberty to\ndoubt of their accustomed opinions, and quit the beaten highway, they\nwill never be able to thread the byway that would lead them by a\nshorter course, and will lose themselves and continue to wander for\nlife; in the second place, of those who, possessed of sufficient sense\nor modesty to determine that there are others who excel them in the\npower of discriminating between truth and error, and by whom they may\nbe instructed, ought rather to content themselves with the opinions of\nsuch than trust for more correct to their own reason.\nFor my own part, I should doubtless have belonged to the latter class,\nhad I received instruction from but one master, or had I never known\nthe diversities of opinion that from time immemorial have prevailed\namong men of the greatest learning. But I had become aware, even so\nearly as during my college life, that no opinion, however absurd and\nincredible, can be imagined, which has not been maintained by some on\nof the philosophers; and afterwards in the course of my travels I\nremarked that all those whose opinions are decidedly repugnant to ours\nare not in that account barbarians and savages, but on the contrary\nthat many of these nations make an equally good, if not better, use of\ntheir reason than we do. I took into account also the very different\ncharacter which a person brought up from infancy in France or Germany\nexhibits, from that which, with the same mind originally, this\nindividual would have possessed had he lived always among the Chinese\nor with savages, and the circumstance that in dress itself the fashion\nwhich pleased us ten years ago, and which may again, perhaps, be\nreceived into favor before ten years have gone, appears to us at this\nmoment extravagant and ridiculous. I was thus led to infer that the\nground of our opinions is far more custom and example than any certain\nknowledge. And, finally, although such be the ground of our opinions, I\nremarked that a plurality of suffrages is no guarantee of truth where\nit is at all of difficult discovery, as in such cases it is much more\nlikely that it will be found by one than by many. I could, however,\nselect from the crowd no one whose opinions seemed worthy of\npreference, and thus I found myself constrained, as it were, to use my\nown reason in the conduct of my life.\nBut like one walking alone and in the dark, I resolved to proceed so\nslowly and with such circumspection, that if I did not advance far, I\nwould at least guard against falling. I did not even choose to dismiss\nsummarily any of the opinions that had crept into my belief without\nhaving been introduced by reason, but first of all took sufficient time\ncarefully to satisfy myself of the general nature of the task I was\nsetting myself, and ascertain the true method by which to arrive at the\nknowledge of whatever lay within the compass of my powers.\nAmong the branches of philosophy, I had, at an earlier period, given\nsome attention to logic, and among those of the mathematics to\ngeometrical analysis and algebra,--three arts or sciences which ought,\nas I conceived, to contribute something to my design. But, on\nexamination, I found that, as for logic, its syllogisms and the\nmajority of its other precepts are of avail--rather in the\ncommunication of what we already know, or even as the art of Lully, in\nspeaking without judgment of things of which we are ignorant, than in\nthe investigation of the unknown; and although this science contains\nindeed a number of correct and very excellent precepts, there are,\nnevertheless, so many others, and these either injurious or\nsuperfluous, mingled with the former, that it is almost quite as\ndifficult to effect a severance of the true from the false as it is to\nextract a Diana or a Minerva from a rough block of marble. Then as to\nthe analysis of the ancients and the algebra of the moderns, besides\nthat they embrace only matters highly abstract, and, to appearance, of\nno use, the former is so exclusively restricted to the consideration of\nfigures, that it can exercise the understanding only on condition of\ngreatly fatiguing the imagination; and, in the latter, there is so\ncomplete a subjection to certain rules and formulas, that there results\nan art full of confusion and obscurity calculated to embarrass, instead\nof a science fitted to cultivate the mind. By these considerations I\nwas induced to seek some other method which would comprise the\nadvantages of the three and be exempt from their defects. And as a\nmultitude of laws often only hampers justice, so that a state is best\ngoverned when, with few laws, these are rigidly administered; in like\nmanner, instead of the great number of precepts of which logic is\ncomposed, I believed that the four following would prove perfectly\nsufficient for me, provided I took the firm and unwavering resolution\nnever in a single instance to fail in observing them.\nThe first was never to accept anything for true which I did not clearly\nknow to be such; that is to say, carefully to avoid precipitancy and\nprejudice, and to comprise nothing more in my judgement than what was\npresented to my mind so clearly and distinctly as to exclude all ground\nof doubt.\nThe second, to divide each of the difficulties under examination into\nas many parts as possible, and as might be necessary for its adequate\nsolution.\nThe third, to conduct my thoughts in such order that, by commencing\nwith objects the simplest and easiest to know, I might ascend by little\nand little, and, as it were, step by step, to the knowledge of the more\ncomplex; assigning in thought a certain order even to those objects\nwhich in their own nature do not stand in a relation of antecedence and\nsequence.\nAnd the _last_, in every case to make enumerations so complete, and\nreviews so general, that I might be assured that nothing was omitted.\nThe long chains of simple and easy reasonings by means of which\ngeometers are accustomed to reach the conclusions of their most\ndifficult demonstrations, had led me to imagine that all things, to the\nknowledge of which man is competent, are mutually connected in the same\nway, and that there is nothing so far removed from us as to be beyond\nour reach, or so hidden that we cannot discover it, provided only we\nabstain from accepting the false for the true, and always preserve in\nour thoughts the order necessary for the deduction of one truth from\nanother. And I had little difficulty in determining the objects with\nwhich it was necessary to commence, for I was already persuaded that it\nmust be with the simplest and easiest to know, and, considering that of\nall those who have hitherto sought truth in the sciences, the\nmathematicians alone have been able to find any demonstrations, that\nis, any certain and evident reasons, I did not doubt but that such must\nhave been the rule of their investigations. I resolved to commence,\ntherefore, with the examination of the simplest objects, not\nanticipating, however, from this any other advantage than that to be\nfound in accustoming my mind to the love and nourishment of truth, and\nto a distaste for all such reasonings as were unsound. But I had no\nintention on that account of attempting to master all the particular\nsciences commonly denominated mathematics: but observing that, however\ndifferent their objects, they all agree in considering only the various\nrelations or proportions subsisting among those objects, I thought it\nbest for my purpose to consider these proportions in the most general\nform possible, without referring them to any objects in particular,\nexcept such as would most facilitate the knowledge of them, and without\nby any means restricting them to these, that afterwards I might thus be\nthe better able to apply them to every other class of objects to which\nthey are legitimately applicable. Perceiving further, that in order to\nunderstand these relations I should sometimes have to consider them one\nby one and sometimes only to bear them in mind, or embrace them in the\naggregate, I thought that, in order the better to consider them\nindividually, I should view them as subsisting between straight lines,\nthan which I could find no objects more simple, or capable of being\nmore distinctly represented to my imagination and senses; and on the\nother hand, that in order to retain them in the memory or embrace an\naggregate of many, I should express them by certain characters the\nbriefest possible. In this way I believed that I could borrow all that\nwas best both in geometrical analysis and in algebra, and correct all\nthe defects of the one by help of the other.\nAnd, in point of fact, the accurate observance of these few precepts\ngave me, I take the liberty of saying, such ease in unraveling all the\nquestions embraced in these two sciences, that in the two or three\nmonths I devoted to their examination, not only did I reach solutions\nof questions I had formerly deemed exceedingly difficult but even as\nregards questions of the solution of which I continued ignorant, I was\nenabled, as it appeared to me, to determine the means whereby, and the\nextent to which a solution was possible; results attributable to the\ncircumstance that I commenced with the simplest and most general\ntruths, and that thus each truth discovered was a rule available in the\ndiscovery of subsequent ones Nor in this perhaps shall I appear too\nvain, if it be considered that, as the truth on any particular point is\none whoever apprehends the truth, knows all that on that point can be\nknown. The child, for example, who has been instructed in the elements\nof arithmetic, and has made a particular addition, according to rule,\nmay be assured that he has found, with respect to the sum of the\nnumbers before him, and that in this instance is within the reach of\nhuman genius. Now, in conclusion, the method which teaches adherence to\nthe true order, and an exact enumeration of all the conditions of the\nthing sought includes all that gives certitude to the rules of\narithmetic.\nBut the chief ground of my satisfaction with thus method, was the\nassurance I had of thereby exercising my reason in all matters, if not\nwith absolute perfection, at least with the greatest attainable by me:\nbesides, I was conscious that by its use my mind was becoming gradually\nhabituated to clearer and more distinct conceptions of its objects; and\nI hoped also, from not having restricted this method to any particular\nmatter, to apply it to the difficulties of the other sciences, with not\nless success than to those of algebra. I should not, however, on this\naccount have ventured at once on the examination of all the\ndifficulties of the sciences which presented themselves to me, for this\nwould have been contrary to the order prescribed in the method, but\nobserving that the knowledge of such is dependent on principles\nborrowed from philosophy, in which I found nothing certain, I thought\nit necessary first of all to endeavor to establish its principles. And\nbecause I observed, besides, that an inquiry of this kind was of all\nothers of the greatest moment, and one in which precipitancy and\nanticipation in judgment were most to be dreaded, I thought that I\nought not to approach it till I had reached a more mature age (being at\nthat time but twenty-three), and had first of all employed much of my\ntime in preparation for the work, as well by eradicating from my mind\nall the erroneous opinions I had up to that moment accepted, as by\namassing variety of experience to afford materials for my reasonings,\nand by continually exercising myself in my chosen method with a view to\nincreased skill in its application.\nPART III\nAnd finally, as it is not enough, before commencing to rebuild the\nhouse in which we live, that it be pulled down, and materials and\nbuilders provided, or that we engage in the work ourselves, according\nto a plan which we have beforehand carefully drawn out, but as it is\nlikewise necessary that we be furnished with some other house in which\nwe may live commodiously during the operations, so that I might not\nremain irresolute in my actions, while my reason compelled me to\nsuspend my judgement, and that I might not be prevented from living\nthenceforward in the greatest possible felicity, I formed a provisory\ncode of morals, composed of three or four maxims, with which I am\ndesirous to make you acquainted.\nThe _first_ was to obey the laws and customs of my country, adhering\nfirmly to the faith in which, by the grace of God, I had been educated\nfrom my childhood and regulating my conduct in every other matter\naccording to the most moderate opinions, and the farthest removed from\nextremes, which should happen to be adopted in practice with general\nconsent of the most judicious of those among whom I might be living.\nFor as I had from that time begun to hold my own opinions for nought\nbecause I wished to subject them all to examination, I was convinced\nthat I could not do better than follow in the meantime the opinions of\nthe most judicious; and although there are some perhaps among the\nPersians and Chinese as judicious as among ourselves, expediency seemed\nto dictate that I should regulate my practice conformably to the\nopinions of those with whom I should have to live; and it appeared to\nme that, in order to ascertain the real opinions of such, I ought\nrather to take cognizance of what they practised than of what they\nsaid, not only because, in the corruption of our manners, there are few\ndisposed to speak exactly as they believe, but also because very many\nare not aware of what it is that they really believe; for, as the act\nof mind by which a thing is believed is different from that by which we\nknow that we believe it, the one act is often found without the other.\nAlso, amid many opinions held in equal repute, I chose always the most\nmoderate, as much for the reason that these are always the most\nconvenient for practice, and probably the best (for all excess is\ngenerally vicious), as that, in the event of my falling into error, I\nmight be at less distance from the truth than if, having chosen one of\nthe extremes, it should turn out to be the other which I ought to have\nadopted. And I placed in the class of extremes especially all promises\nby which somewhat of our freedom is abridged; not that I disapproved of\nthe laws which, to provide against the instability of men of feeble\nresolution, when what is sought to be accomplished is some good, permit\nengagements by vows and contracts binding the parties to persevere in\nit, or even, for the security of commerce, sanction similar engagements\nwhere the purpose sought to be realized is indifferent: but because I\ndid not find anything on earth which was wholly superior to change, and\nbecause, for myself in particular, I hoped gradually to perfect my\njudgments, and not to suffer them to deteriorate, I would have deemed\nit a grave sin against good sense, if, for the reason that I approved\nof something at a particular time, I therefore bound myself to hold it\nfor good at a subsequent time, when perhaps it had ceased to be so, or\nI had ceased to esteem it such.\nMy _second_ maxim was to be as firm and resolute in my actions as I was\nable, and not to adhere less steadfastly to the most doubtful opinions,\nwhen once adopted, than if they had been highly certain; imitating in\nthis the example of travelers who, when they have lost their way in a\nforest, ought not to wander from side to side, far less remain in one\nplace, but proceed constantly towards the same side in as straight a\nline as possible, without changing their direction for slight reasons,\nalthough perhaps it might be chance alone which at first determined the\nselection; for in this way, if they do not exactly reach the point they\ndesire, they will come at least in the end to some place that will\nprobably be preferable to the middle of a forest. In the same way,\nsince in action it frequently happens that no delay is permissible, it\nis very certain that, when it is not in our power to determine what is\ntrue, we ought to act according to what is most probable; and even\nalthough we should not remark a greater probability in one opinion than\nin another, we ought notwithstanding to choose one or the other, and\nafterwards consider it, in so far as it relates to practice, as no\nlonger dubious, but manifestly true and certain, since the reason by\nwhich our choice has been determined is itself possessed of these\nqualities. This principle was sufficient thenceforward to rid me of all\nthose repentings and pangs of remorse that usually disturb the\nconsciences of such feeble and uncertain minds as, destitute of any\nclear and determinate principle of choice, allow themselves one day to\nadopt a course of action as the best, which they abandon the next, as\nthe opposite.\nMy _third_ maxim was to endeavor always to conquer myself rather than\nfortune, and change my desires rather than the order of the world, and\nin general, accustom myself to the persuasion that, except our own\nthoughts, there is nothing absolutely in our power; so that when we\nhave done our best in things external to us, all wherein we fail of\nsuccess is to be held, as regards us, absolutely impossible: and this\nsingle principle seemed to me sufficient to prevent me from desiring\nfor the future anything which I could not obtain, and thus render me\ncontented; for since our will naturally seeks those objects alone which\nthe understanding represents as in some way possible of attainment, it\nis plain, that if we consider all external goods as equally beyond our\npower, we shall no more regret the absence of such goods as seem due to\nour birth, when deprived of them without any fault of ours, than our\nnot possessing the kingdoms of China or Mexico, and thus making, so to\nspeak, a virtue of necessity, we shall no more desire health in\ndisease, or freedom in imprisonment, than we now do bodies\nincorruptible as diamonds, or the wings of birds to fly with. But I\nconfess there is need of prolonged discipline and frequently repeated\nmeditation to accustom the mind to view all objects in this light; and\nI believe that in this chiefly consisted the secret of the power of\nsuch philosophers as in former times were enabled to rise superior to\nthe influence of fortune, and, amid suffering and poverty, enjoy a\nhappiness which their gods might have envied. For, occupied incessantly\nwith the consideration of the limits prescribed to their power by\nnature, they became so entirely convinced that nothing was at their\ndisposal except their own thoughts, that this conviction was of itself\nsufficient to prevent their entertaining any desire of other objects;\nand over their thoughts they acquired a sway so absolute, that they had\nsome ground on this account for esteeming themselves more rich and more\npowerful, more free and more happy, than other men who, whatever be the\nfavors heaped on them by nature and fortune, if destitute of this\nphilosophy, can never command the realization of all their desires.\nIn fine, to conclude this code of morals, I thought of reviewing the\ndifferent occupations of men in this life, with the view of making\nchoice of the best. And, without wishing to offer any remarks on the\nemployments of others, I may state that it was my conviction that I\ncould not do better than continue in that in which I was engaged, viz.,\nin devoting my whole life to the culture of my reason, and in making\nthe greatest progress I was able in the knowledge of truth, on the\nprinciples of the method which I had prescribed to myself. This method,\nfrom the time I had begun to apply it, had been to me the source of\nsatisfaction so intense as to lead me to, believe that more perfect or\nmore innocent could not be enjoyed in this life; and as by its means I\ndaily discovered truths that appeared to me of some importance, and of\nwhich other men were generally ignorant, the gratification thence\narising so occupied my mind that I was wholly indifferent to every\nother object. Besides, the three preceding maxims were founded singly\non the design of continuing the work of self-instruction. For since God\nhas endowed each of us with some light of reason by which to\ndistinguish truth from error, I could not have believed that I ought\nfor a single moment to rest satisfied with the opinions of another,\nunless I had resolved to exercise my own judgment in examining these\nwhenever I should be duly qualified for the task. Nor could I have\nproceeded on such opinions without scruple, had I supposed that I\nshould thereby forfeit any advantage for attaining still more accurate,\nshould such exist. And, in fine, I could not have restrained my\ndesires, nor remained satisfied had I not followed a path in which I\nthought myself certain of attaining all the knowledge to the\nacquisition of which I was competent, as well as the largest amount of\nwhat is truly good which I could ever hope to secure Inasmuch as we\nneither seek nor shun any object except in so far as our understanding\nrepresents it as good or bad, all that is necessary to right action is\nright judgment, and to the best action the most correct judgment, that\nis, to the acquisition of all the virtues with all else that is truly\nvaluable and within our reach; and the assurance of such an acquisition\ncannot fail to render us contented.\nHaving thus provided myself with these maxims, and having placed them\nin reserve along with the truths of faith, which have ever occupied the\nfirst place in my belief, I came to the conclusion that I might with\nfreedom set about ridding myself of what remained of my opinions. And,\ninasmuch as I hoped to be better able successfully to accomplish this\nwork by holding intercourse with mankind, than by remaining longer shut\nup in the retirement where these thoughts had occurred to me, I betook\nme again to traveling before the winter was well ended. And, during the\nnine subsequent years, I did nothing but roam from one place to\nanother, desirous of being a spectator rather than an actor in the\nplays exhibited on the theater of the world; and, as I made it my\nbusiness in each matter to reflect particularly upon what might fairly\nbe doubted and prove a source of error, I gradually rooted out from my\nmind all the errors which had hitherto crept into it. Not that in this\nI imitated the sceptics who doubt only that they may doubt, and seek\nnothing beyond uncertainty itself; for, on the contrary, my design was\nsingly to find ground of assurance, and cast aside the loose earth and\nsand, that I might reach the rock or the clay. In this, as appears to\nme, I was successful enough; for, since I endeavored to discover the\nfalsehood or incertitude of the propositions I examined, not by feeble\nconjectures, but by clear and certain reasonings, I met with nothing so\ndoubtful as not to yield some conclusion of adequate certainty,\nalthough this were merely the inference, that the matter in question\ncontained nothing certain. And, just as in pulling down an old house,\nwe usually reserve the ruins to contribute towards the erection, so, in\ndestroying such of my opinions as I judged to be Ill-founded, I made a\nvariety of observations and acquired an amount of experience of which I\navailed myself in the establishment of more certain. And further, I\ncontinued to exercise myself in the method I had prescribed; for,\nbesides taking care in general to conduct all my thoughts according to\nits rules, I reserved some hours from time to time which I expressly\ndevoted to the employment of the method in the solution of mathematical\ndifficulties, or even in the solution likewise of some questions\nbelonging to other sciences, but which, by my having detached them from\nsuch principles of these sciences as were of inadequate certainty, were\nrendered almost mathematical: the truth of this will be manifest from\nthe numerous examples contained in this volume. And thus, without in\nappearance living otherwise than those who, with no other occupation\nthan that of spending their lives agreeably and innocently, study to\nsever pleasure from vice, and who, that they may enjoy their leisure\nwithout ennui, have recourse to such pursuits as are honorable, I was\nnevertheless prosecuting my design, and making greater progress in the\nknowledge of truth, than I might, perhaps, have made had I been engaged\nin the perusal of books merely, or in holding converse with men of\nletters.\nThese nine years passed away, however, before I had come to any\ndeterminate judgment respecting the difficulties which form matter of\ndispute among the learned, or had commenced to seek the principles of\nany philosophy more certain than the vulgar. And the examples of many\nmen of the highest genius, who had, in former times, engaged in this\ninquiry, but, as appeared to me, without success, led me to imagine it\nto be a work of so much difficulty, that I would not perhaps have\nventured on it so soon had I not heard it currently rumored that I had\nalready completed the inquiry. I know not what were the grounds of this\nopinion; and, if my conversation contributed in any measure to its\nrise, this must have happened rather from my having confessed my\nIgnorance with greater freedom than those are accustomed to do who have\nstudied a little, and expounded perhaps, the reasons that led me to\ndoubt of many of those things that by others are esteemed certain, than\nfrom my having boasted of any system of philosophy. But, as I am of a\ndisposition that makes me unwilling to be esteemed different from what\nI really am, I thought it necessary to endeavor by all means to render\nmyself worthy of the reputation accorded to me; and it is now exactly\neight years since this desire constrained me to remove from all those\nplaces where interruption from any of my acquaintances was possible,\nand betake myself to this country, in which the long duration of the\nwar has led to the establishment of such discipline, that the armies\nmaintained seem to be of use only in enabling the inhabitants to enjoy\nmore securely the blessings of peace and where, in the midst of a great\ncrowd actively engaged in business, and more careful of their own\naffairs than curious about those of others, I have been enabled to live\nwithout being deprived of any of the conveniences to be had in the most\npopulous cities, and yet as solitary and as retired as in the midst of\nthe most remote deserts.\nPART IV\nI am in doubt as to the propriety of making my first meditations in the\nplace above mentioned matter of discourse; for these are so\nmetaphysical, and so uncommon, as not, perhaps, to be acceptable to\nevery one. And yet, that it may be determined whether the foundations\nthat I have laid are sufficiently secure, I find myself in a measure\nconstrained to advert to them. I had long before remarked that, in\nrelation to practice, it is sometimes necessary to adopt, as if above\ndoubt, opinions which we discern to be highly uncertain, as has been\nalready said; but as I then desired to give my attention solely to the\nsearch after truth, I thought that a procedure exactly the opposite was\ncalled for, and that I ought to reject as absolutely false all opinions\nin regard to which I could suppose the least ground for doubt, in order\nto ascertain whether after that there remained aught in my belief that\nwas wholly indubitable. Accordingly, seeing that our senses sometimes\ndeceive us, I was willing to suppose that there existed nothing really\nsuch as they presented to us; and because some men err in reasoning,\nand fall into paralogisms, even on the simplest matters of geometry, I,\nconvinced that I was as open to error as any other, rejected as false\nall the reasonings I had hitherto taken for demonstrations; and\nfinally, when I considered that the very same thoughts (presentations)\nwhich we experience when awake may also be experienced when we are\nasleep, while there is at that time not one of them true, I supposed\nthat all the objects (presentations) that had ever entered into my mind\nwhen awake, had in them no more truth than the illusions of my dreams.\nBut immediately upon this I observed that, whilst I thus wished to\nthink that all was false, it was absolutely necessary that I, who thus\nthought, should be somewhat; and as I observed that this truth, I\nthink, therefore I am (COGITO ERGO SUM), was so certain and of such\nevidence that no ground of doubt, however extravagant, could be alleged\nby the sceptics capable of shaking it, I concluded that I might,\nwithout scruple, accept it as the first principle of the philosophy of\nwhich I was in search.\nIn the next place, I attentively examined what I was and as I observed\nthat I could suppose that I had no body, and that there was no world\nnor any place in which I might be; but that I could not therefore\nsuppose that I was not; and that, on the contrary, from the very\ncircumstance that I thought to doubt of the truth of other things, it\nmost clearly and certainly followed that I was; while, on the other\nhand, if I had only ceased to think, although all the other objects\nwhich I had ever imagined had been in reality existent, I would have\nhad no reason to believe that I existed; I thence concluded that I was\na substance whose whole essence or nature consists only in thinking,\nand which, that it may exist, has need of no place, nor is dependent on\nany material thing; so that \u201cI,\u201d that is to say, the mind by which I am\nwhat I am, is wholly distinct from the body, and is even more easily\nknown than the latter, and is such, that although the latter were not,\nit would still continue to be all that it is.\nAfter this I inquired in general into what is essential to the truth\nand certainty of a proposition; for since I had discovered one which I\nknew to be true, I thought that I must likewise be able to discover the\nground of this certitude. And as I observed that in the words I think,\ntherefore I am, there is nothing at all which gives me assurance of\ntheir truth beyond this, that I see very clearly that in order to think\nit is necessary to exist, I concluded that I might take, as a general\nrule, the principle, that all the things which we very clearly and\ndistinctly conceive are true, only observing, however, that there is\nsome difficulty in rightly determining the objects which we distinctly\nconceive.\nIn the next place, from reflecting on the circumstance that I doubted,\nand that consequently my being was not wholly perfect (for I clearly\nsaw that it was a greater perfection to know than to doubt), I was led\nto inquire whence I had learned to think of something more perfect than\nmyself; and I clearly recognized that I must hold this notion from some\nnature which in reality was more perfect. As for the thoughts of many\nother objects external to me, as of the sky, the earth, light, heat,\nand a thousand more, I was less at a loss to know whence these came;\nfor since I remarked in them nothing which seemed to render them\nsuperior to myself, I could believe that, if these were true, they were\ndependencies on my own nature, in so far as it possessed a certain\nperfection, and, if they were false, that I held them from nothing,\nthat is to say, that they were in me because of a certain imperfection\nof my nature. But this could not be the case with-the idea of a nature\nmore perfect than myself; for to receive it from nothing was a thing\nmanifestly impossible; and, because it is not less repugnant that the\nmore perfect should be an effect of, and dependence on the less\nperfect, than that something should proceed from nothing, it was\nequally impossible that I could hold it from myself: accordingly, it\nbut remained that it had been placed in me by a nature which was in\nreality more perfect than mine, and which even possessed within itself\nall the perfections of which I could form any idea; that is to say, in\na single word, which was God. And to this I added that, since I knew\nsome perfections which I did not possess, I was not the only being in\nexistence (I will here, with your permission, freely use the terms of\nthe schools); but, on the contrary, that there was of necessity some\nother more perfect Being upon whom I was dependent, and from whom I had\nreceived all that I possessed; for if I had existed alone, and\nindependently of every other being, so as to have had from myself all\nthe perfection, however little, which I actually possessed, I should\nhave been able, for the same reason, to have had from myself the whole\nremainder of perfection, of the want of which I was conscious, and thus\ncould of myself have become infinite, eternal, immutable, omniscient,\nall-powerful, and, in fine, have possessed all the perfections which I\ncould recognize in God. For in order to know the nature of God (whose\nexistence has been established by the preceding reasonings), as far as\nmy own nature permitted, I had only to consider in reference to all the\nproperties of which I found in my mind some idea, whether their\npossession was a mark of perfection; and I was assured that no one\nwhich indicated any imperfection was in him, and that none of the rest\nwas awanting. Thus I perceived that doubt, inconstancy, sadness, and\nsuch like, could not be found in God, since I myself would have been\nhappy to be free from them. Besides, I had ideas of many sensible and\ncorporeal things; for although I might suppose that I was dreaming, and\nthat all which I saw or imagined was false, I could not, nevertheless,\ndeny that the ideas were in reality in my thoughts. But, because I had\nalready very clearly recognized in myself that the intelligent nature\nis distinct from the corporeal, and as I observed that all composition\nis an evidence of dependency, and that a state of dependency is\nmanifestly a state of imperfection, I therefore determined that it\ncould not be a perfection in God to be compounded of these two natures\nand that consequently he was not so compounded; but that if there were\nany bodies in the world, or even any intelligences, or other natures\nthat were not wholly perfect, their existence depended on his power in\nsuch a way that they could not subsist without him for a single moment.\nI was disposed straightway to search for other truths and when I had\nrepresented to myself the object of the geometers, which I conceived to\nbe a continuous body or a space indefinitely extended in length,\nbreadth, and height or depth, divisible into divers parts which admit\nof different figures and sizes, and of being moved or transposed in all\nmanner of ways (for all this the geometers suppose to be in the object\nthey contemplate), I went over some of their simplest demonstrations.\nAnd, in the first place, I observed, that the great certitude which by\ncommon consent is accorded to these demonstrations, is founded solely\nupon this, that they are clearly conceived in accordance with the rules\nI have already laid down In the next place, I perceived that there was\nnothing at all in these demonstrations which could assure me of the\nexistence of their object: thus, for example, supposing a triangle to\nbe given, I distinctly perceived that its three angles were necessarily\nequal to two right angles, but I did not on that account perceive\nanything which could assure me that any triangle existed: while, on the\ncontrary, recurring to the examination of the idea of a Perfect Being,\nI found that the existence of the Being was comprised in the idea in\nthe same way that the equality of its three angles to two right angles\nis comprised in the idea of a triangle, or as in the idea of a sphere,\nthe equidistance of all points on its surface from the center, or even\nstill more clearly; and that consequently it is at least as certain\nthat God, who is this Perfect Being, is, or exists, as any\ndemonstration of geometry can be.\nBut the reason which leads many to persuade them selves that there is a\ndifficulty in knowing this truth, and even also in knowing what their\nmind really is, is that they never raise their thoughts above sensible\nobjects, and are so accustomed to consider nothing except by way of\nimagination, which is a mode of thinking limited to material objects,\nthat all that is not imaginable seems to them not intelligible. The\ntruth of this is sufficiently manifest from the single circumstance,\nthat the philosophers of the schools accept as a maxim that there is\nnothing in the understanding which was not previously in the senses, in\nwhich however it is certain that the ideas of God and of the soul have\nnever been; and it appears to me that they who make use of their\nimagination to comprehend these ideas do exactly the some thing as if,\nin order to hear sounds or smell odors, they strove to avail themselves\nof their eyes; unless indeed that there is this difference, that the\nsense of sight does not afford us an inferior assurance to those of\nsmell or hearing; in place of which, neither our imagination nor our\nsenses can give us assurance of anything unless our understanding\nintervene.\nFinally, if there be still persons who are not sufficiently persuaded\nof the existence of God and of the soul, by the reasons I have adduced,\nI am desirous that they should know that all the other propositions, of\nthe truth of which they deem themselves perhaps more assured, as that\nwe have a body, and that there exist stars and an earth, and such like,\nare less certain; for, although we have a moral assurance of these\nthings, which is so strong that there is an appearance of extravagance\nin doubting of their existence, yet at the same time no one, unless his\nintellect is impaired, can deny, when the question relates to a\nmetaphysical certitude, that there is sufficient reason to exclude\nentire assurance, in the observation that when asleep we can in the\nsame way imagine ourselves possessed of another body and that we see\nother stars and another earth, when there is nothing of the kind. For\nhow do we know that the thoughts which occur in dreaming are false\nrather than those other which we experience when awake, since the\nformer are often not less vivid and distinct than the latter? And\nthough men of the highest genius study this question as long as they\nplease, I do not believe that they will be able to give any reason\nwhich can be sufficient to remove this doubt, unless they presuppose\nthe existence of God. For, in the first place even the principle which\nI have already taken as a rule, viz., that all the things which we\nclearly and distinctly conceive are true, is certain only because God\nis or exists and because he is a Perfect Being, and because all that we\npossess is derived from him: whence it follows that our ideas or\nnotions, which to the extent of their clearness and distinctness are\nreal, and proceed from God, must to that extent be true. Accordingly,\nwhereas we not infrequently have ideas or notions in which some falsity\nis contained, this can only be the case with such as are to some extent\nconfused and obscure, and in this proceed from nothing (participate of\nnegation), that is, exist in us thus confused because we are not wholly\nperfect. And it is evident that it is not less repugnant that falsity\nor imperfection, in so far as it is imperfection, should proceed from\nGod, than that truth or perfection should proceed from nothing. But if\nwe did not know that all which we possess of real and true proceeds\nfrom a Perfect and Infinite Being, however clear and distinct our ideas\nmight be, we should have no ground on that account for the assurance\nthat they possessed the perfection of being true.\nBut after the knowledge of God and of the soul has rendered us certain\nof this rule, we can easily understand that the truth of the thoughts\nwe experience when awake, ought not in the slightest degree to be\ncalled in question on account of the illusions of our dreams. For if it\nhappened that an individual, even when asleep, had some very distinct\nidea, as, for example, if a geometer should discover some new\ndemonstration, the circumstance of his being asleep would not militate\nagainst its truth; and as for the most ordinary error of our dreams,\nwhich consists in their representing to us various objects in the same\nway as our external senses, this is not prejudicial, since it leads us\nvery properly to suspect the truth of the ideas of sense; for we are\nnot infrequently deceived in the same manner when awake; as when\npersons in the jaundice see all objects yellow, or when the stars or\nbodies at a great distance appear to us much smaller than they are.\nFor, in fine, whether awake or asleep, we ought never to allow\nourselves to be persuaded of the truth of anything unless on the\nevidence of our reason. And it must be noted that I say of our reason,\nand not of our imagination or of our senses: thus, for example,\nalthough we very clearly see the sun, we ought not therefore to\ndetermine that it is only of the size which our sense of sight\npresents; and we may very distinctly imagine the head of a lion joined\nto the body of a goat, without being therefore shut up to the\nconclusion that a chimaera exists; for it is not a dictate of reason\nthat what we thus see or imagine is in reality existent; but it plainly\ntells us that all our ideas or notions contain in them some truth; for\notherwise it could not be that God, who is wholly perfect and\nveracious, should have placed them in us. And because our reasonings\nare never so clear or so complete during sleep as when we are awake,\nalthough sometimes the acts of our imagination are then as lively and\ndistinct, if not more so than in our waking moments, reason further\ndictates that, since all our thoughts cannot be true because of our\npartial imperfection, those possessing truth must infallibly be found\nin the experience of our waking moments rather than in that of our\ndreams.\nPART V\nI would here willingly have proceeded to exhibit the whole chain of\ntruths which I deduced from these primary but as with a view to this it\nwould have been necessary now to treat of many questions in dispute\namong the earned, with whom I do not wish to be embroiled, I believe\nthat it will be better for me to refrain from this exposition, and only\nmention in general what these truths are, that the more judicious may\nbe able to determine whether a more special account of them would\nconduce to the public advantage. I have ever remained firm in my\noriginal resolution to suppose no other principle than that of which I\nhave recently availed myself in demonstrating the existence of God and\nof the soul, and to accept as true nothing that did not appear to me\nmore clear and certain than the demonstrations of the geometers had\nformerly appeared; and yet I venture to state that not only have I\nfound means to satisfy myself in a short time on all the principal\ndifficulties which are usually treated of in philosophy, but I have\nalso observed certain laws established in nature by God in such a\nmanner, and of which he has impressed on our minds such notions, that\nafter we have reflected sufficiently upon these, we cannot doubt that\nthey are accurately observed in all that exists or takes place in the\nworld and farther, by considering the concatenation of these laws, it\nappears to me that I have discovered many truths more useful and more\nimportant than all I had before learned, or even had expected to learn.\nBut because I have essayed to expound the chief of these discoveries in\na treatise which certain considerations prevent me from publishing, I\ncannot make the results known more conveniently than by here giving a\nsummary of the contents of this treatise. It was my design to comprise\nin it all that, before I set myself to write it, I thought I knew of\nthe nature of material objects. But like the painters who, finding\nthemselves unable to represent equally well on a plain surface all the\ndifferent faces of a solid body, select one of the chief, on which\nalone they make the light fall, and throwing the rest into the shade,\nallow them to appear only in so far as they can be seen while looking\nat the principal one; so, fearing lest I should not be able to compense\nin my discourse all that was in my mind, I resolved to expound singly,\nthough at considerable length, my opinions regarding light; then to\ntake the opportunity of adding something on the sun and the fixed\nstars, since light almost wholly proceeds from them; on the heavens\nsince they transmit it; on the planets, comets, and earth, since they\nreflect it; and particularly on all the bodies that are upon the earth,\nsince they are either colored, or transparent, or luminous; and finally\non man, since he is the spectator of these objects. Further, to enable\nme to cast this variety of subjects somewhat into the shade, and to\nexpress my judgment regarding them with greater freedom, without being\nnecessitated to adopt or refute the opinions of the learned, I resolved\nto leave all the people here to their disputes, and to speak only of\nwhat would happen in a new world, if God were now to create somewhere\nin the imaginary spaces matter sufficient to compose one, and were to\nagitate variously and confusedly the different parts of this matter, so\nthat there resulted a chaos as disordered as the poets ever feigned,\nand after that did nothing more than lend his ordinary concurrence to\nnature, and allow her to act in accordance with the laws which he had\nestablished. On this supposition, I, in the first place, described this\nmatter, and essayed to represent it in such a manner that to my mind\nthere can be nothing clearer and more intelligible, except what has\nbeen recently said regarding God and the soul; for I even expressly\nsupposed that it possessed none of those forms or qualities which are\nso debated in the schools, nor in general anything the knowledge of\nwhich is not so natural to our minds that no one can so much as imagine\nhimself ignorant of it. Besides, I have pointed out what are the laws\nof nature; and, with no other principle upon which to found my\nreasonings except the infinite perfection of God, I endeavored to\ndemonstrate all those about which there could be any room for doubt,\nand to prove that they are such, that even if God had created more\nworlds, there could have been none in which these laws were not\nobserved. Thereafter, I showed how the greatest part of the matter of\nthis chaos must, in accordance with these laws, dispose and arrange\nitself in such a way as to present the appearance of heavens; how in\nthe meantime some of its parts must compose an earth and some planets\nand comets, and others a sun and fixed stars. And, making a digression\nat this stage on the subject of light, I expounded at considerable\nlength what the nature of that light must be which is found in the sun\nand the stars, and how thence in an instant of time it traverses the\nimmense spaces of the heavens, and how from the planets and comets it\nis reflected towards the earth. To this I likewise added much\nrespecting the substance, the situation, the motions, and all the\ndifferent qualities of these heavens and stars; so that I thought I had\nsaid enough respecting them to show that there is nothing observable in\nthe heavens or stars of our system that must not, or at least may not\nappear precisely alike in those of the system which I described. I came\nnext to speak of the earth in particular, and to show how, even though\nI had expressly supposed that God had given no weight to the matter of\nwhich it is composed, this should not prevent all its parts from\ntending exactly to its center; how with water and air on its surface,\nthe disposition of the heavens and heavenly bodies, more especially of\nthe moon, must cause a flow and ebb, like in all its circumstances to\nthat observed in our seas, as also a certain current both of water and\nair from east to west, such as is likewise observed between the\ntropics; how the mountains, seas, fountains, and rivers might naturally\nbe formed in it, and the metals produced in the mines, and the plants\ngrow in the fields and in general, how all the bodies which are\ncommonly denominated mixed or composite might be generated and, among\nother things in the discoveries alluded to inasmuch as besides the\nstars, I knew nothing except fire which produces light, I spared no\npains to set forth all that pertains to its nature,--the manner of its\nproduction and support, and to explain how heat is sometimes found\nwithout light, and light without heat; to show how it can induce\nvarious colors upon different bodies and other diverse qualities; how\nit reduces some to a liquid state and hardens others; how it can\nconsume almost all bodies, or convert them into ashes and smoke; and\nfinally, how from these ashes, by the mere intensity of its action, it\nforms glass: for as this transmutation of ashes into glass appeared to\nme as wonderful as any other in nature, I took a special pleasure in\ndescribing it. I was not, however, disposed, from these circumstances,\nto conclude that this world had been created in the manner I described;\nfor it is much more likely that God made it at the first such as it was\nto be. But this is certain, and an opinion commonly received among\ntheologians, that the action by which he now sustains it is the same\nwith that by which he originally created it; so that even although he\nhad from the beginning given it no other form than that of chaos,\nprovided only he had established certain laws of nature, and had lent\nit his concurrence to enable it to act as it is wont to do, it may be\nbelieved, without discredit to the miracle of creation, that, in this\nway alone, things purely material might, in course of time, have become\nsuch as we observe them at present; and their nature is much more\neasily conceived when they are beheld coming in this manner gradually\ninto existence, than when they are only considered as produced at once\nin a finished and perfect state.\nFrom the description of inanimate bodies and plants, I passed to\nanimals, and particularly to man. But since I had not as yet sufficient\nknowledge to enable me to treat of these in the same manner as of the\nrest, that is to say, by deducing effects from their causes, and by\nshowing from what elements and in what manner nature must produce them,\nI remained satisfied with the supposition that God formed the body of\nman wholly like to one of ours, as well in the external shape of the\nmembers as in the internal conformation of the organs, of the same\nmatter with that I had described, and at first placed in it no rational\nsoul, nor any other principle, in room of the vegetative or sensitive\nsoul, beyond kindling in the heart one of those fires without light,\nsuch as I had already described, and which I thought was not different\nfrom the heat in hay that has been heaped together before it is dry, or\nthat which causes fermentation in new wines before they are run clear\nof the fruit. For, when I examined the kind of functions which might,\nas consequences of this supposition, exist in this body, I found\nprecisely all those which may exist in us independently of all power of\nthinking, and consequently without being in any measure owing to the\nsoul; in other words, to that part of us which is distinct from the\nbody, and of which it has been said above that the nature distinctively\nconsists in thinking, functions in which the animals void of reason may\nbe said wholly to resemble us; but among which I could not discover any\nof those that, as dependent on thought alone, belong to us as men,\nwhile, on the other hand, I did afterwards discover these as soon as I\nsupposed God to have created a rational soul, and to have annexed it to\nthis body in a particular manner which I described.\nBut, in order to show how I there handled this matter, I mean here to\ngive the explication of the motion of the heart and arteries, which, as\nthe first and most general motion observed in animals, will afford the\nmeans of readily determining what should be thought of all the rest.\nAnd that there may be less difficulty in understanding what I am about\nto say on this subject, I advise those who are not versed in anatomy,\nbefore they commence the perusal of these observations, to take the\ntrouble of getting dissected in their presence the heart of some large\nanimal possessed of lungs (for this is throughout sufficiently like the\nhuman), and to have shown to them its two ventricles or cavities: in\nthe first place, that in the right side, with which correspond two very\nample tubes, viz., the hollow vein (_vena cava_), which is the\nprincipal receptacle of the blood, and the trunk of the tree, as it\nwere, of which all the other veins in the body are branches; and the\narterial vein (_vena arteriosa_), inappropriately so denominated, since\nit is in truth only an artery, which, taking its rise in the heart, is\ndivided, after passing out from it, into many branches which presently\ndisperse themselves all over the lungs; in the second place, the cavity\nin the left side, with which correspond in the same manner two canals\nin size equal to or larger than the preceding, viz., the venous artery\n(_arteria venosa_), likewise inappropriately thus designated, because\nit is simply a vein which comes from the lungs, where it is divided\ninto many branches, interlaced with those of the arterial vein, and\nthose of the tube called the windpipe, through which the air we breathe\nenters; and the great artery which, issuing from the heart, sends its\nbranches all over the body. I should wish also that such persons were\ncarefully shown the eleven pellicles which, like so many small valves,\nopen and shut the four orifices that are in these two cavities, viz.,\nthree at the entrance of the hollow veins where they are disposed in\nsuch a manner as by no means to prevent the blood which it contains\nfrom flowing into the right ventricle of the heart, and yet exactly to\nprevent its flowing out; three at the entrance to the arterial vein,\nwhich, arranged in a manner exactly the opposite of the former, readily\npermit the blood contained in this cavity to pass into the lungs, but\nhinder that contained in the lungs from returning to this cavity; and,\nin like manner, two others at the mouth of the venous artery, which\nallow the blood from the lungs to flow into the left cavity of the\nheart, but preclude its return; and three at the mouth of the great\nartery, which suffer the blood to flow from the heart, but prevent its\nreflux. Nor do we need to seek any other reason for the number of these\npellicles beyond this that the orifice of the venous artery being of an\noval shape from the nature of its situation, can be adequately closed\nwith two, whereas the others being round are more conveniently closed\nwith three. Besides, I wish such persons to observe that the grand\nartery and the arterial vein are of much harder and firmer texture than\nthe venous artery and the hollow vein; and that the two last expand\nbefore entering the heart, and there form, as it were, two pouches\ndenominated the auricles of the heart, which are composed of a\nsubstance similar to that of the heart itself; and that there is always\nmore warmth in the heart than in any other part of the body--and\nfinally, that this heat is capable of causing any drop of blood that\npasses into the cavities rapidly to expand and dilate, just as all\nliquors do when allowed to fall drop by drop into a highly heated\nvessel.\nFor, after these things, it is not necessary for me to say anything\nmore with a view to explain the motion of the heart, except that when\nits cavities are not full of blood, into these the blood of necessity\nflows,--from the hollow vein into the right, and from the venous artery\ninto the left; because these two vessels are always full of blood, and\ntheir orifices, which are turned towards the heart, cannot then be\nclosed. But as soon as two drops of blood have thus passed, one into\neach of the cavities, these drops which cannot but be very large,\nbecause the orifices through which they pass are wide, and the vessels\nfrom which they come full of blood, are immediately rarefied, and\ndilated by the heat they meet with. In this way they cause the whole\nheart to expand, and at the same time press home and shut the five\nsmall valves that are at the entrances of the two vessels from which\nthey flow, and thus prevent any more blood from coming down into the\nheart, and becoming more and more rarefied, they push open the six\nsmall valves that are in the orifices of the other two vessels, through\nwhich they pass out, causing in this way all the branches of the\narterial vein and of the grand artery to expand almost simultaneously\nwith the heart which immediately thereafter begins to contract, as do\nalso the arteries, because the blood that has entered them has cooled,\nand the six small valves close, and the five of the hollow vein and of\nthe venous artery open anew and allow a passage to other two drops of\nblood, which cause the heart and the arteries again to expand as\nbefore. And, because the blood which thus enters into the heart passes\nthrough these two pouches called auricles, it thence happens that their\nmotion is the contrary of that of the heart, and that when it expands\nthey contract. But lest those who are ignorant of the force of\nmathematical demonstrations and who are not accustomed to distinguish\ntrue reasons from mere verisimilitudes, should venture, without\nexamination, to deny what has been said, I wish it to be considered\nthat the motion which I have now explained follows as necessarily from\nthe very arrangement of the parts, which may be observed in the heart\nby the eye alone, and from the heat which may be felt with the fingers,\nand from the nature of the blood as learned from experience, as does\nthe motion of a clock from the power, the situation, and shape of its\ncounterweights and wheels.\nBut if it be asked how it happens that the blood in the veins, flowing\nin this way continually into the heart, is not exhausted, and why the\narteries do not become too full, since all the blood which passes\nthrough the heart flows into them, I need only mention in reply what\nhas been written by a physician of England, who has the honor of having\nbroken the ice on this subject, and of having been the first to teach\nthat there are many small passages at the extremities of the arteries,\nthrough which the blood received by them from the heart passes into the\nsmall branches of the veins, whence it again returns to the heart; so\nthat its course amounts precisely to a perpetual circulation. Of this\nwe have abundant proof in the ordinary experience of surgeons, who, by\nbinding the arm with a tie of moderate straitness above the part where\nthey open the vein, cause the blood to flow more copiously than it\nwould have done without any ligature; whereas quite the contrary would\nhappen were they to bind it below; that is, between the hand and the\nopening, or were to make the ligature above the opening very tight. For\nit is manifest that the tie, moderately straightened, while adequate to\nhinder the blood already in the arm from returning towards the heart by\nthe veins, cannot on that account prevent new blood from coming forward\nthrough the arteries, because these are situated below the veins, and\ntheir coverings, from their greater consistency, are more difficult to\ncompress; and also that the blood which comes from the heart tends to\npass through them to the hand with greater force than it does to return\nfrom the hand to the heart through the veins. And since the latter\ncurrent escapes from the arm by the opening made in one of the veins,\nthere must of necessity be certain passages below the ligature, that\nis, towards the extremities of the arm through which it can come\nthither from the arteries. This physician likewise abundantly\nestablishes what he has advanced respecting the motion of the blood,\nfrom the existence of certain pellicles, so disposed in various places\nalong the course of the veins, in the manner of small valves, as not to\npermit the blood to pass from the middle of the body towards the\nextremities, but only to return from the extremities to the heart; and\nfarther, from experience which shows that all the blood which is in the\nbody may flow out of it in a very short time through a single artery\nthat has been cut, even although this had been closely tied in the\nimmediate neighborhood of the heart and cut between the heart and the\nligature, so as to prevent the supposition that the blood flowing out\nof it could come from any other quarter than the heart.\nBut there are many other circumstances which evince that what I have\nalleged is the true cause of the motion of the blood: thus, in the\nfirst place, the difference that is observed between the blood which\nflows from the veins, and that from the arteries, can only arise from\nthis, that being rarefied, and, as it were, distilled by passing\nthrough the heart, it is thinner, and more vivid, and warmer\nimmediately after leaving the heart, in other words, when in the\narteries, than it was a short time before passing into either, in other\nwords, when it was in the veins; and if attention be given, it will be\nfound that this difference is very marked only in the neighborhood of\nthe heart; and is not so evident in parts more remote from it. In the\nnext place, the consistency of the coats of which the arterial vein and\nthe great artery are composed, sufficiently shows that the blood is\nimpelled against them with more force than against the veins. And why\nshould the left cavity of the heart and the great artery be wider and\nlarger than the right cavity and the arterial vein, were it not that\nthe blood of the venous artery, having only been in the lungs after it\nhas passed through the heart, is thinner, and rarefies more readily,\nand in a higher degree, than the blood which proceeds immediately from\nthe hollow vein? And what can physicians conjecture from feeling the\npulse unless they know that according as the blood changes its nature\nit can be rarefied by the warmth of the heart, in a higher or lower\ndegree, and more or less quickly than before? And if it be inquired how\nthis heat is communicated to the other members, must it not be admitted\nthat this is effected by means of the blood, which, passing through the\nheart, is there heated anew, and thence diffused over all the body?\nWhence it happens, that if the blood be withdrawn from any part, the\nheat is likewise withdrawn by the same means; and although the heart\nwere as-hot as glowing iron, it would not be capable of warming the\nfeet and hands as at present, unless it continually sent thither new\nblood. We likewise perceive from this, that the true use of respiration\nis to bring sufficient fresh air into the lungs, to cause the blood\nwhich flows into them from the right ventricle of the heart, where it\nhas been rarefied and, as it were, changed into vapors, to become\nthick, and to convert it anew into blood, before it flows into the left\ncavity, without which process it would be unfit for the nourishment of\nthe fire that is there. This receives confirmation from the\ncircumstance, that it is observed of animals destitute of lungs that\nthey have also but one cavity in the heart, and that in children who\ncannot use them while in the womb, there is a hole through which the\nblood flows from the hollow vein into the left cavity of the heart, and\na tube through which it passes from the arterial vein into the grand\nartery without passing through the lung. In the next place, how could\ndigestion be carried on in the stomach unless the heart communicated\nheat to it through the arteries, and along with this certain of the\nmore fluid parts of the blood, which assist in the dissolution of the\nfood that has been taken in? Is not also the operation which converts\nthe juice of food into blood easily comprehended, when it is considered\nthat it is distilled by passing and repassing through the heart perhaps\nmore than one or two hundred times in a day? And what more need be\nadduced to explain nutrition, and the production of the different\nhumors of the body, beyond saying, that the force with which the blood,\nin being rarefied, passes from the heart towards the extremities of the\narteries, causes certain of its parts to remain in the members at which\nthey arrive, and there occupy the place of some others expelled by\nthem; and that according to the situation, shape, or smallness of the\npores with which they meet, some rather than others flow into certain\nparts, in the same way that some sieves are observed to act, which, by\nbeing variously perforated, serve to separate different species of\ngrain? And, in the last place, what above all is here worthy of\nobservation, is the generation of the animal spirits, which are like a\nvery subtle wind, or rather a very pure and vivid flame which,\ncontinually ascending in great abundance from the heart to the brain,\nthence penetrates through the nerves into the muscles, and gives motion\nto all the members; so that to account for other parts of the blood\nwhich, as most agitated and penetrating, are the fittest to compose\nthese spirits, proceeding towards the brain, it is not necessary to\nsuppose any other cause, than simply, that the arteries which carry\nthem thither proceed from the heart in the most direct lines, and that,\naccording to the rules of mechanics which are the same with those of\nnature, when many objects tend at once to the same point where there is\nnot sufficient room for all (as is the case with the parts of the blood\nwhich flow forth from the left cavity of the heart and tend towards the\nbrain), the weaker and less agitated parts must necessarily be driven\naside from that point by the stronger which alone in this way reach it\nI had expounded all these matters with sufficient minuteness in the\ntreatise which I formerly thought of publishing. And after these, I had\nshown what must be the fabric of the nerves and muscles of the human\nbody to give the animal spirits contained in it the power to move the\nmembers, as when we see heads shortly after they have been struck off\nstill move and bite the earth, although no longer animated; what\nchanges must take place in the brain to produce waking, sleep, and\ndreams; how light, sounds, odors, tastes, heat, and all the other\nqualities of external objects impress it with different ideas by means\nof the senses; how hunger, thirst, and the other internal affections\ncan likewise impress upon it divers ideas; what must be understood by\nthe common sense (_sensus communis_) in which these ideas are received,\nby the memory which retains them, by the fantasy which can change them\nin various ways, and out of them compose new ideas, and which, by the\nsame means, distributing the animal spirits through the muscles, can\ncause the members of such a body to move in as many different ways, and\nin a manner as suited, whether to the objects that are presented to its\nsenses or to its internal affections, as can take place in our own case\napart from the guidance of the will. Nor will this appear at all\nstrange to those who are acquainted with the variety of movements\nperformed by the different automata, or moving machines fabricated by\nhuman industry, and that with help of but few pieces compared with the\ngreat multitude of bones, muscles, nerves, arteries, veins, and other\nparts that are found in the body of each animal. Such persons will look\nupon this body as a machine made by the hands of God, which is\nincomparably better arranged, and adequate to movements more admirable\nthan is any machine of human invention. And here I specially stayed to\nshow that, were there such machines exactly resembling organs and\noutward form an ape or any other irrational animal, we could have no\nmeans of knowing that they were in any respect of a different nature\nfrom these animals; but if there were machines bearing the image of our\nbodies, and capable of imitating our actions as far as it is morally\npossible, there would still remain two most certain tests whereby to\nknow that they were not therefore really men. Of these the first is\nthat they could never use words or other signs arranged in such a\nmanner as is competent to us in order to declare our thoughts to\nothers: for we may easily conceive a machine to be so constructed that\nit emits vocables, and even that it emits some correspondent to the\naction upon it of external objects which cause a change in its organs;\nfor example, if touched in a particular place it may demand what we\nwish to say to it; if in another it may cry out that it is hurt, and\nsuch like; but not that it should arrange them variously so as\nappositely to reply to what is said in its presence, as men of the\nlowest grade of intellect can do. The second test is, that although\nsuch machines might execute many things with equal or perhaps greater\nperfection than any of us, they would, without doubt, fail in certain\nothers from which it could be discovered that they did not act from\nknowledge, but solely from the disposition of their organs: for while\nreason is an universal instrument that is alike available on every\noccasion, these organs, on the contrary, need a particular arrangement\nfor each particular action; whence it must be morally impossible that\nthere should exist in any machine a diversity of organs sufficient to\nenable it to act in all the occurrences of life, in the way in which\nour reason enables us to act. Again, by means of these two tests we may\nlikewise know the difference between men and brutes. For it is highly\ndeserving of remark, that there are no men so dull and stupid, not even\nidiots, as to be incapable of joining together different words, and\nthereby constructing a declaration by which to make their thoughts\nunderstood; and that on the other hand, there is no other animal,\nhowever perfect or happily circumstanced, which can do the like. Nor\ndoes this inability arise from want of organs: for we observe that\nmagpies and parrots can utter words like ourselves, and are yet unable\nto speak as we do, that is, so as to show that they understand what\nthey say; in place of which men born deaf and dumb, and thus not less,\nbut rather more than the brutes, destitute of the organs which others\nuse in speaking, are in the habit of spontaneously inventing certain\nsigns by which they discover their thoughts to those who, being usually\nin their company, have leisure to learn their language. And this proves\nnot only that the brutes have less reason than man, but that they have\nnone at all: for we see that very little is required to enable a person\nto speak; and since a certain inequality of capacity is observable\namong animals of the same species, as well as among men, and since some\nare more capable of being instructed than others, it is incredible that\nthe most perfect ape or parrot of its species, should not in this be\nequal to the most stupid infant of its kind or at least to one that was\ncrack-brained, unless the soul of brutes were of a nature wholly\ndifferent from ours. And we ought not to confound speech with the\nnatural movements which indicate the passions, and can be imitated by\nmachines as well as manifested by animals; nor must it be thought with\ncertain of the ancients, that the brutes speak, although we do not\nunderstand their language. For if such were the case, since they are\nendowed with many organs analogous to ours, they could as easily\ncommunicate their thoughts to us as to their fellows. It is also very\nworthy of remark, that, though there are many animals which manifest\nmore industry than we in certain of their actions, the same animals are\nyet observed to show none at all in many others: so that the\ncircumstance that they do better than we does not prove that they are\nendowed with mind, for it would thence follow that they possessed\ngreater reason than any of us, and could surpass us in all things; on\nthe contrary, it rather proves that they are destitute of reason, and\nthat it is nature which acts in them according to the disposition of\ntheir organs: thus it is seen, that a clock composed only of wheels and\nweights can number the hours and measure time more exactly than we with\nall our skin.\nI had after this described the reasonable soul, and shown that it could\nby no means be educed from the power of matter, as the other things of\nwhich I had spoken, but that it must be expressly created; and that it\nis not sufficient that it be lodged in the human body exactly like a\npilot in a ship, unless perhaps to move its members, but that it is\nnecessary for it to be joined and united more closely to the body, in\norder to have sensations and appetites similar to ours, and thus\nconstitute a real man. I here entered, in conclusion, upon the subject\nof the soul at considerable length, because it is of the greatest\nmoment: for after the error of those who deny the existence of God, an\nerror which I think I have already sufficiently refuted, there is none\nthat is more powerful in leading feeble minds astray from the straight\npath of virtue than the supposition that the soul of the brutes is of\nthe same nature with our own; and consequently that after this life we\nhave nothing to hope for or fear, more than flies and ants; in place of\nwhich, when we know how far they differ we much better comprehend the\nreasons which establish that the soul is of a nature wholly independent\nof the body, and that consequently it is not liable to die with the\nlatter and, finally, because no other causes are observed capable of\ndestroying it, we are naturally led thence to judge that it is\nimmortal.\nPART VI\nThree years have now elapsed since I finished the treatise containing\nall these matters; and I was beginning to revise it, with the view to\nput it into the hands of a printer, when I learned that persons to whom\nI greatly defer, and whose authority over my actions is hardly less\ninfluential than is my own reason over my thoughts, had condemned a\ncertain doctrine in physics, published a short time previously by\nanother individual to which I will not say that I adhered, but only\nthat, previously to their censure I had observed in it nothing which I\ncould imagine to be prejudicial either to religion or to the state, and\nnothing therefore which would have prevented me from giving expression\nto it in writing, if reason had persuaded me of its truth; and this led\nme to fear lest among my own doctrines likewise some one might be found\nin which I had departed from the truth, notwithstanding the great care\nI have always taken not to accord belief to new opinions of which I had\nnot the most certain demonstrations, and not to give expression to\naught that might tend to the hurt of any one. This has been sufficient\nto make me alter my purpose of publishing them; for although the\nreasons by which I had been induced to take this resolution were very\nstrong, yet my inclination, which has always been hostile to writing\nbooks, enabled me immediately to discover other considerations\nsufficient to excuse me for not undertaking the task. And these\nreasons, on one side and the other, are such, that not only is it in\nsome measure my interest here to state them, but that of the public,\nperhaps, to know them.\nI have never made much account of what has proceeded from my own mind;\nand so long as I gathered no other advantage from the method I employ\nbeyond satisfying myself on some difficulties belonging to the\nspeculative sciences, or endeavoring to regulate my actions according\nto the principles it taught me, I never thought myself bound to publish\nanything respecting it. For in what regards manners, every one is so\nfull of his own wisdom, that there might be found as many reformers as\nheads, if any were allowed to take upon themselves the task of mending\nthem, except those whom God has constituted the supreme rulers of his\npeople or to whom he has given sufficient grace and zeal to be\nprophets; and although my speculations greatly pleased myself, I\nbelieved that others had theirs, which perhaps pleased them still more.\nBut as soon as I had acquired some general notions respecting physics,\nand beginning to make trial of them in various particular difficulties,\nhad observed how far they can carry us, and how much they differ from\nthe principles that have been employed up to the present time, I\nbelieved that I could not keep them concealed without sinning\ngrievously against the law by which we are bound to promote, as far as\nin us lies, the general good of mankind. For by them I perceived it to\nbe possible to arrive at knowledge highly useful in life; and in room\nof the speculative philosophy usually taught in the schools, to\ndiscover a practical, by means of which, knowing the force and action\nof fire, water, air the stars, the heavens, and all the other bodies\nthat surround us, as distinctly as we know the various crafts of our\nartisans, we might also apply them in the same way to all the uses to\nwhich they are adapted, and thus render ourselves the lords and\npossessors of nature. And this is a result to be desired, not only in\norder to the invention of an infinity of arts, by which we might be\nenabled to enjoy without any trouble the fruits of the earth, and all\nits comforts, but also and especially for the preservation of health,\nwhich is without doubt, of all the blessings of this life, the first\nand fundamental one; for the mind is so intimately dependent upon the\ncondition and relation of the organs of the body, that if any means can\never be found to render men wiser and more ingenious than hitherto, I\nbelieve that it is in medicine they must be sought for. It is true that\nthe science of medicine, as it now exists, contains few things whose\nutility is very remarkable: but without any wish to depreciate it, I am\nconfident that there is no one, even among those whose profession it\nis, who does not admit that all at present known in it is almost\nnothing in comparison of what remains to be discovered; and that we\ncould free ourselves from an infinity of maladies of body as well as of\nmind, and perhaps also even from the debility of age, if we had\nsufficiently ample knowledge of their causes, and of all the remedies\nprovided for us by nature. But since I designed to employ my whole life\nin the search after so necessary a science, and since I had fallen in\nwith a path which seems to me such, that if any one follow it he must\ninevitably reach the end desired, unless he be hindered either by the\nshortness of life or the want of experiments, I judged that there could\nbe no more effectual provision against these two impediments than if I\nwere faithfully to communicate to the public all the little I might\nmyself have found, and incite men of superior genius to strive to\nproceed farther, by contributing, each according to his inclination and\nability, to the experiments which it would be necessary to make, and\nalso by informing the public of all they might discover, so that, by\nthe last beginning where those before them had left off, and thus\nconnecting the lives and labours of many, we might collectively proceed\nmuch farther than each by himself could do.\nI remarked, moreover, with respect to experiments, that they become\nalways more necessary the more one is advanced in knowledge; for, at\nthe commencement, it is better to make use only of what is\nspontaneously presented to our senses, and of which we cannot remain\nignorant, provided we bestow on it any reflection, however slight, than\nto concern ourselves about more uncommon and recondite phenomena: the\nreason of which is, that the more uncommon often only mislead us so\nlong as the causes of the more ordinary are still unknown; and the\ncircumstances upon which they depend are almost always so special and\nminute as to be highly difficult to detect. But in this I have adopted\nthe following order: first, I have essayed to find in general the\nprinciples, or first causes of all that is or can be in the world,\nwithout taking into consideration for this end anything but God himself\nwho has created it, and without educing them from any other source than\nfrom certain germs of truths naturally existing in our minds In the\nsecond place, I examined what were the first and most ordinary effects\nthat could be deduced from these causes; and it appears to me that, in\nthis way, I have found heavens, stars, an earth, and even on the earth\nwater, air, fire, minerals, and some other things of this kind, which\nof all others are the most common and simple, and hence the easiest to\nknow. Afterwards when I wished to descend to the more particular, so\nmany diverse objects presented themselves to me, that I believed it to\nbe impossible for the human mind to distinguish the forms or species of\nbodies that are upon the earth, from an infinity of others which might\nhave been, if it had pleased God to place them there, or consequently\nto apply them to our use, unless we rise to causes through their\neffects, and avail ourselves of many particular experiments. Thereupon,\nturning over in my mind I the objects that had ever been presented to\nmy senses I freely venture to state that I have never observed any\nwhich I could not satisfactorily explain by the principles had\ndiscovered. But it is necessary also to confess that the power of\nnature is so ample and vast, and these principles so simple and\ngeneral, that I have hardly observed a single particular effect which I\ncannot at once recognize as capable of being deduced in man different\nmodes from the principles, and that my greatest difficulty usually is\nto discover in which of these modes the effect is dependent upon them;\nfor out of this difficulty cannot otherwise extricate myself than by\nagain seeking certain experiments, which may be such that their result\nis not the same, if it is in the one of these modes at we must explain\nit, as it would be if it were to be explained in the other. As to what\nremains, I am now in a position to discern, as I think, with sufficient\nclearness what course must be taken to make the majority those\nexperiments which may conduce to this end: but I perceive likewise that\nthey are such and so numerous, that neither my hands nor my income,\nthough it were a thousand times larger than it is, would be sufficient\nfor them all; so that according as henceforward I shall have the means\nof making more or fewer experiments, I shall in the same proportion\nmake greater or less progress in the knowledge of nature. This was what\nI had hoped to make known by the treatise I had written, and so clearly\nto exhibit the advantage that would thence accrue to the public, as to\ninduce all who have the common good of man at heart, that is, all who\nare virtuous in truth, and not merely in appearance, or according to\nopinion, as well to communicate to me the experiments they had already\nmade, as to assist me in those that remain to be made.\nBut since that time other reasons have occurred to me, by which I have\nbeen led to change my opinion, and to think that I ought indeed to go\non committing to writing all the results which I deemed of any moment,\nas soon as I should have tested their truth, and to bestow the same\ncare upon them as I would have done had it been my design to publish\nthem. This course commended itself to me, as well because I thus\nafforded myself more ample inducement to examine them thoroughly, for\ndoubtless that is always more narrowly scrutinized which we believe\nwill be read by many, than that which is written merely for our private\nuse (and frequently what has seemed to me true when I first conceived\nit, has appeared false when I have set about committing it to writing),\nas because I thus lost no opportunity of advancing the interests of the\npublic, as far as in me lay, and since thus likewise, if my writings\npossess any value, those into whose hands they may fall after my death\nmay be able to put them to what use they deem proper. But I resolved by\nno means to consent to their publication during my lifetime, lest\neither the oppositions or the controversies to which they might give\nrise, or even the reputation, such as it might be, which they would\nacquire for me, should be any occasion of my losing the time that I had\nset apart for my own improvement. For though it be true that every one\nis bound to promote to the extent of his ability the good of others,\nand that to be useful to no one is really to be worthless, yet it is\nlikewise true that our cares ought to extend beyond the present, and it\nis good to omit doing what might perhaps bring some profit to the\nliving, when we have in view the accomplishment of other ends that will\nbe of much greater advantage to posterity. And in truth, I am quite\nwilling it should be known that the little I have hitherto learned is\nalmost nothing in comparison with that of which I am ignorant, and to\nthe knowledge of which I do not despair of being able to attain; for it\nis much the same with those who gradually discover truth in the\nsciences, as with those who when growing rich find less difficulty in\nmaking great acquisitions, than they formerly experienced when poor in\nmaking acquisitions of much smaller amount. Or they may be compared to\nthe commanders of armies, whose forces usually increase in proportion\nto their victories, and who need greater prudence to keep together the\nresidue of their troops after a defeat than after a victory to take\ntowns and provinces. For he truly engages in battle who endeavors to\nsurmount all the difficulties and errors which prevent him from\nreaching the knowledge of truth, and he is overcome in fight who admits\na false opinion touching a matter of any generality and importance, and\nhe requires thereafter much more skill to recover his former position\nthan to make great advances when once in possession of thoroughly\nascertained principles. As for myself, if I have succeeded in\ndiscovering any truths in the sciences (and I trust that what is\ncontained in this volume I will show that I have found some), I can\ndeclare that they are but the consequences and results of five or six\nprincipal difficulties which I have surmounted, and my encounters with\nwhich I reckoned as battles in which victory declared for me. I will\nnot hesitate even to avow my belief that nothing further is wanting to\nenable me fully to realize my designs than to gain two or three similar\nvictories; and that I am not so far advanced in years but that,\naccording to the ordinary course of nature, I may still have sufficient\nleisure for this end. But I conceive myself the more bound to husband\nthe time that remains the greater my expectation of being able to\nemploy it aright, and I should doubtless have much to rob me of it,\nwere I to publish the principles of my physics: for although they are\nalmost all so evident that to assent to them no more is needed than\nsimply to understand them, and although there is not one of them of\nwhich I do not expect to be able to give demonstration, yet, as it is\nimpossible that they can be in accordance with all the diverse opinions\nof others, I foresee that I should frequently be turned aside from my\ngrand design, on occasion of the opposition which they would be sure to\nawaken.\nIt may be said, that these oppositions would be useful both in making\nme aware of my errors, and, if my speculations contain anything of\nvalue, in bringing others to a fuller understanding of it; and still\nfarther, as many can see better than one, in leading others who are now\nbeginning to avail themselves of my principles, to assist me in turn\nwith their discoveries. But though I recognize my extreme liability to\nerror, and scarce ever trust to the first thoughts which occur to me,\nyet-the experience I have had of possible objections to my views\nprevents me from anticipating any profit from them. For I have already\nhad frequent proof of the judgments, as well of those I esteemed\nfriends, as of some others to whom I thought I was an object of\nindifference, and even of some whose malignancy and envy would, I knew,\ndetermine them to endeavor to discover what partiality concealed from\nthe eyes of my friends. But it has rarely happened that anything has\nbeen objected to me which I had myself altogether overlooked, unless it\nwere something far removed from the subject: so that I have never met\nwith a single critic of my opinions who did not appear to me either\nless rigorous or less equitable than myself. And further, I have never\nobserved that any truth before unknown has been brought to light by the\ndisputations that are practised in the schools; for while each strives\nfor the victory, each is much more occupied in making the best of mere\nverisimilitude, than in weighing the reasons on both sides of the\nquestion; and those who have been long good advocates are not\nafterwards on that account the better judges.\nAs for the advantage that others would derive from the communication of\nmy thoughts, it could not be very great; because I have not yet so far\nprosecuted them as that much does not remain to be added before they\ncan be applied to practice. And I think I may say without vanity, that\nif there is any one who can carry them out that length, it must be\nmyself rather than another: not that there may not be in the world many\nminds incomparably superior to mine, but because one cannot so well\nseize a thing and make it one\u2019s own, when it has been learned from\nanother, as when one has himself discovered it. And so true is this of\nthe present subject that, though I have often explained some of my\nopinions to persons of much acuteness, who, whilst I was speaking,\nappeared to understand them very distinctly, yet, when they repeated\nthem, I have observed that they almost always changed them to such an\nextent that I could no longer acknowledge them as mine. I am glad, by\nthe way, to take this opportunity of requesting posterity never to\nbelieve on hearsay that anything has proceeded from me which has not\nbeen published by myself; and I am not at all astonished at the\nextravagances attributed to those ancient philosophers whose own\nwritings we do not possess; whose thoughts, however, I do not on that\naccount suppose to have been really absurd, seeing they were among the\nablest men of their times, but only that these have been falsely\nrepresented to us. It is observable, accordingly, that scarcely in a\nsingle instance has any one of their disciples surpassed them; and I am\nquite sure that the most devoted of the present followers of Aristotle\nwould think themselves happy if they had as much knowledge of nature as\nhe possessed, were it even under the condition that they should never\nafterwards attain to higher. In this respect they are like the ivy\nwhich never strives to rise above the tree that sustains it, and which\nfrequently even returns downwards when it has reached the top; for it\nseems to me that they also sink, in other words, render themselves less\nwise than they would be if they gave up study, who, not contented with\nknowing all that is intelligibly explained in their author, desire in\naddition to find in him the solution of many difficulties of which he\nsays not a word, and never perhaps so much as thought. Their fashion of\nphilosophizing, however, is well suited to persons whose abilities fall\nbelow mediocrity; for the obscurity of the distinctions and principles\nof which they make use enables them to speak of all things with as much\nconfidence as if they really knew them, and to defend all that they say\non any subject against the most subtle and skillful, without its being\npossible for any one to convict them of error. In this they seem to me\nto be like a blind man, who, in order to fight on equal terms with a\nperson that sees, should have made him descend to the bottom of an\nintensely dark cave: and I may say that such persons have an interest\nin my refraining from publishing the principles of the philosophy of\nwhich I make use; for, since these are of a kind the simplest and most\nevident, I should, by publishing them, do much the same as if I were to\nthrow open the windows, and allow the light of day to enter the cave\ninto which the combatants had descended. But even superior men have no\nreason for any great anxiety to know these principles, for if what they\ndesire is to be able to speak of all things, and to acquire a\nreputation for learning, they will gain their end more easily by\nremaining satisfied with the appearance of truth, which can be found\nwithout much difficulty in all sorts of matters, than by seeking the\ntruth itself which unfolds itself but slowly and that only in some\ndepartments, while it obliges us, when we have to speak of others,\nfreely to confess our ignorance. If, however, they prefer the knowledge\nof some few truths to the vanity of appearing ignorant of none, as such\nknowledge is undoubtedly much to be preferred, and, if they choose to\nfollow a course similar to mine, they do not require for this that I\nshould say anything more than I have already said in this discourse.\nFor if they are capable of making greater advancement than I have made,\nthey will much more be able of themselves to discover all that I\nbelieve myself to have found; since as I have never examined aught\nexcept in order, it is certain that what yet remains to be discovered\nis in itself more difficult and recondite, than that which I have\nalready been enabled to find, and the gratification would be much less\nin learning it from me than in discovering it for themselves. Besides\nthis, the habit which they will acquire, by seeking first what is easy,\nand then passing onward slowly and step by step to the more difficult,\nwill benefit them more than all my instructions. Thus, in my own case,\nI am persuaded that if I had been taught from my youth all the truths\nof which I have since sought out demonstrations, and had thus learned\nthem without labour, I should never, perhaps, have known any beyond\nthese; at least, I should never have acquired the habit and the\nfacility which I think I possess in always discovering new truths in\nproportion as I give myself to the search. And, in a single word, if\nthere is any work in the world which cannot be so well finished by\nanother as by him who has commenced it, it is that at which I labour.\nIt is true, indeed, as regards the experiments which may conduce to\nthis end, that one man is not equal to the task of making them all; but\nyet he can advantageously avail himself, in this work, of no hands\nbesides his own, unless those of artisans, or parties of the same kind,\nwhom he could pay, and whom the hope of gain (a means of great\nefficacy) might stimulate to accuracy in the performance of what was\nprescribed to them. For as to those who, through curiosity or a desire\nof learning, of their own accord, perhaps, offer him their services,\nbesides that in general their promises exceed their performance, and\nthat they sketch out fine designs of which not one is ever realized,\nthey will, without doubt, expect to be compensated for their trouble by\nthe explication of some difficulties, or, at least, by compliments and\nuseless speeches, in which he cannot spend any portion of his time\nwithout loss to himself. And as for the experiments that others have\nalready made, even although these parties should be willing of\nthemselves to communicate them to him (which is what those who esteem\nthem secrets will never do), the experiments are, for the most part,\naccompanied with so many circumstances and superfluous elements, as to\nmake it exceedingly difficult to disentangle the truth from its\nadjuncts--besides, he will find almost all of them so ill described, or\neven so false (because those who made them have wished to see in them\nonly such facts as they deemed conformable to their principles), that,\nif in the entire number there should be some of a nature suited to his\npurpose, still their value could not compensate for the time what would\nbe necessary to make the selection. So that if there existed any one\nwhom we assuredly knew to be capable of making discoveries of the\nhighest kind, and of the greatest possible utility to the public; and\nif all other men were therefore eager by all means to assist him in\nsuccessfully prosecuting his designs, I do not see that they could do\naught else for him beyond contributing to defray the expenses of the\nexperiments that might be necessary; and for the rest, prevent his\nbeing deprived of his leisure by the unseasonable interruptions of any\none. But besides that I neither have so high an opinion of myself as to\nbe willing to make promise of anything extraordinary, nor feed on\nimaginations so vain as to fancy that the public must be much\ninterested in my designs; I do not, on the other hand, own a soul so\nmean as to be capable of accepting from any one a favor of which it\ncould be supposed that I was unworthy.\nThese considerations taken together were the reason why, for the last\nthree years, I have been unwilling to publish the treatise I had on\nhand, and why I even resolved to give publicity during my life to no\nother that was so general, or by which the principles of my physics\nmight be understood. But since then, two other reasons have come into\noperation that have determined me here to subjoin some particular\nspecimens, and give the public some account of my doings and designs.\nOf these considerations, the first is, that if I failed to do so, many\nwho were cognizant of my previous intention to publish some writings,\nmight have imagined that the reasons which induced me to refrain from\nso doing, were less to my credit than they really are; for although I\nam not immoderately desirous of glory, or even, if I may venture so to\nsay, although I am averse from it in so far as I deem it hostile to\nrepose which I hold in greater account than aught else, yet, at the\nsame time, I have never sought to conceal my actions as if they were\ncrimes, nor made use of many precautions that I might remain unknown;\nand this partly because I should have thought such a course of conduct\na wrong against myself, and partly because it would have occasioned me\nsome sort of uneasiness which would again have been contrary to the\nperfect mental tranquillity which I court. And forasmuch as, while thus\nindifferent to the thought alike of fame or of forgetfulness, I have\nyet been unable to prevent myself from acquiring some sort of\nreputation, I have thought it incumbent on me to do my best to save\nmyself at least from being ill-spoken of. The other reason that has\ndetermined me to commit to writing these specimens of philosophy is,\nthat I am becoming daily more and more alive to the delay which my\ndesign of self-instruction suffers, for want of the infinity of\nexperiments I require, and which it is impossible for me to make\nwithout the assistance of others: and, without flattering myself so\nmuch as to expect the public to take a large share in my interests, I\nam yet unwilling to be found so far wanting in the duty I owe to\nmyself, as to give occasion to those who shall survive me to make it\nmatter of reproach against me some day, that I might have left them\nmany things in a much more perfect state than I have done, had I not\ntoo much neglected to make them aware of the ways in which they could\nhave promoted the accomplishment of my designs.\nAnd I thought that it was easy for me to select some matters which\nshould neither be obnoxious to much controversy, nor should compel me\nto expound more of my principles than I desired, and which should yet\nbe sufficient clearly to exhibit what I can or cannot accomplish in the\nsciences. Whether or not I have succeeded in this it is not for me to\nsay; and I do not wish to forestall the judgments of others by speaking\nmyself of my writings; but it will gratify me if they be examined, and,\nto afford the greater inducement to this I request all who may have any\nobjections to make to them, to take the trouble of forwarding these to\nmy publisher, who will give me notice of them, that I may endeavor to\nsubjoin at the same time my reply; and in this way readers seeing both\nat once will more easily determine where the truth lies; for I do not\nengage in any case to make prolix replies, but only with perfect\nfrankness to avow my errors if I am convinced of them, or if I cannot\nperceive them, simply to state what I think is required for defense of\nthe matters I have written, adding thereto no explication of any new\nmatte that it may not be necessary to pass without end from one thing\nto another.\nIf some of the matters of which I have spoken in the beginning of the\n\u201cDioptrics\u201d and \u201cMeteorics\u201d should offend at first sight, because I\ncall them hypotheses and seem indifferent about giving proof of them, I\nrequest a patient and attentive reading of the whole, from which I hope\nthose hesitating will derive satisfaction; for it appears to me that\nthe reasonings are so mutually connected in these treatises, that, as\nthe last are demonstrated by the first which are their causes, the\nfirst are in their turn demonstrated by the last which are their\neffects. Nor must it be imagined that I here commit the fallacy which\nthe logicians call a circle; for since experience renders the majority\nof these effects most certain, the causes from which I deduce them do\nnot serve so much to establish their reality as to explain their\nexistence; but on the contrary, the reality of the causes is\nestablished by the reality of the effects. Nor have I called them\nhypotheses with any other end in view except that it may be known that\nI think I am able to deduce them from those first truths which I have\nalready expounded; and yet that I have expressly determined not to do\nso, to prevent a certain class of minds from thence taking occasion to\nbuild some extravagant philosophy upon what they may take to be my\nprinciples, and my being blamed for it. I refer to those who imagine\nthat they can master in a day all that another has taken twenty years\nto think out, as soon as he has spoken two or three words to them on\nthe subject; or who are the more liable to error and the less capable\nof perceiving truth in very proportion as they are more subtle and\nlively. As to the opinions which are truly and wholly mine, I offer no\napology for them as new,--persuaded as I am that if their reasons be\nwell considered they will be found to be so simple and so conformed, to\ncommon sense as to appear less extraordinary and less paradoxical than\nany others which can be held on the same subjects; nor do I even boast\nof being the earliest discoverer of any of them, but only of having\nadopted them, neither because they had nor because they had not been\nheld by others, but solely because reason has convinced me of their\ntruth.\nThough artisans may not be able at once to execute the invention which\nis explained in the \u201cDioptrics,\u201d I do not think that any one on that\naccount is entitled to condemn it; for since address and practice are\nrequired in order so to make and adjust the machines described by me as\nnot to overlook the smallest particular, I should not be less\nastonished if they succeeded on the first attempt than if a person were\nin one day to become an accomplished performer on the guitar, by merely\nhaving excellent sheets of music set up before him. And if I write in\nFrench, which is the language of my country, in preference to Latin,\nwhich is that of my preceptors, it is because I expect that those who\nmake use of their unprejudiced natural reason will be better judges of\nmy opinions than those who give heed to the writings of the ancients\nonly; and as for those who unite good sense with habits of study, whom\nalone I desire for judges, they will not, I feel assured, be so partial\nto Latin as to refuse to listen to my reasonings merely because I\nexpound them in the vulgar tongue.\nIn conclusion, I am unwilling here to say anything very specific of the\nprogress which I expect to make for the future in the sciences, or to\nbind myself to the public by any promise which I am not certain of\nbeing able to fulfill; but this only will I say, that I have resolved\nto devote what time I may still have to live to no other occupation\nthan that of endeavoring to acquire some knowledge of Nature, which\nshall be of such a kind as to enable us therefrom to deduce rules in\nmedicine of greater certainty than those at present in use; and that my\ninclination is so much opposed to all other pursuits, especially to\nsuch as cannot be useful to some without being hurtful to others, that\nif, by any circumstances, I had been constrained to engage in such, I\ndo not believe that I should have been able to succeed. Of this I here\nmake a public declaration, though well aware that it cannot serve to\nprocure for me any consideration in the world, which, however, I do not\nin the least affect; and I shall always hold myself more obliged to\nthose through whose favor I am permitted to enjoy my retirement without\ninterruption than to any who might offer me the highest earthly\npreferments.", "source": "discourse.txt"}

So that had a Translator taken upon him to use his own\nliberty of Phrase, he would thereby have endanger\u2019d the sense and force\nof the Arguments; for Politeness of language might as well be expected in\na Translation of ~Euclide~ as in this. And all that are acquainted with\nthis famous Authors design, do very well know, that it was his intention\nin these Meditations ~Mathematically to demonstrate~, that there is a\n~God~, and that mans ~mind~ is ~incorporeal~. And it was his opinion,\nthat metaphysicks may as clearly be demonstrated as mathematicks, as\nwitness his expression in the Dedicatory Epistle of this Work to the\n~Sorbone~ Doctors, ~Eas~ (Rationes scilicet) ~quibus hic utor certitudine\n& evidenti\u00e2 Geometricas \u00e6quare, vel etiam superare existimem~; That he\nreputed his Arguments used in these Meditations, to equal if not excell\nGeometrical certainty._\n_And this, I suppose, is sufficient to make the Reader, not expect herein\nany smoothness of phrase or quaintness of Expression; what is here\ndelivered in English is immediately taken, as it is naturally in the\nOriginal. The words, we hope, may be apposite enough, and fit to express\nwhat is here designed, and I think it a derogation from the Authors skill\nto draw the Picture of his mind in any other Colours, than what his own\nCopy expresses._\n_Thus far in vindication of the Philosophical plain stile and rough\nLanguage of the following Translation. I shall add a line or two, first\nrelating to the Readers, secondly of the Author, and lastly of the\nMeditations themselves, together with the Motives which excited me to\nthis Work._\n_As to the Readers, \u2019tis, I suppose, so evident that candour of mind,\nand freedome from prejudice is requisite to all that desire to advantage\nthemselves by reading other mens notions, that it need not be here\ninsisted on with much earnestness; yet considering the Antiquity of this\nsubject, and the novelty of the Arguments here produced, it seems to be\nmore than ordinarily requisite for an impartial perusal of the ensuing\nTract. Neither are the following Meditations to be slightly passed over,\nbut with diligence and attention to be read; for as in mathematical\ndemonstration, the careless missing of any one single Position may\nrender the Conclusion obscure and sometimes inconsequent, so in these\nmetaphysical Demonstrations, which (as, before has been noted from\nthe illustrious Author thereof) for certainty do equal, if not excel\nGeometrical Propositions, the slight attention to any one particular\nArgument may frustrate the design of the whole discourse._\n_The Reasoning therefore here being close and solid, and (as in\nMathematicks) the knowledge of the latter depending on the knowledge\nof what went before, \u2019tis the duty of every Reader seriously to attend\nthe Particulars, as also the connexion of the whole. Let him weigh the\nArguments and perpend the Conclusions, and after a clear and distinct\nKnowledge, lett him pass his judgement._\n_And to this end I shall make it my request to every Reader, that he\nwould not be content with a single perusal of the following Discourses,\nbut that he would often repeat his reading them over; for by this means\nthe force of those Arguments, which at first may by chance escape the\nmost diligent and attentive Peruser, by a second or third Essay may\noffer themselves more fully to his Consideration. This was the desire\nof our Author in an other of his pieces, I mean his ~Principles of\nPhilosophy~, which I am sure do not require so strict an attention of\nmind, as these abstracted speculations; and therefore if it were his\nRequest in that case, we may Reasonably think that \u2019twas no less his\ndesire in this._\n_When we come to speak of the Incomparable Author of these Meditations,\nwe have reason to lament our own Ignorance, and to blame the Ingratitude\nof the Age wherein he lived, for not transmitting to Posterity more\ncertain and ample Records of the Life and Conversation of this Excellent\nPhilosopher, all that has been Written in this kind gives us only so\nmuch light into the Life of this Prodigious Man, as may make us wish for\nmore; imparting which, I shall recommend the Readers to a further enquiry\ninto the inward Thoughts, (largly discover\u2019d in the Writings) of our\nFamous Author, of whose outward actions and condition we have so small\nknowledge._\n_Renatus Des-Cartes was born on the last day of ~March~ in the year 1596.\nat ~Tours~, or at ~Castrum Eraldum~ a Town near ~Tours~ in ~France~;\nHe came of an Antient and Noble Family, being by Descent ~Lord~ of\n~Perron~, His Father was a Senator of his Country, and a Man of no mean\nestate, leaving to this his only Son by a second Wife between six and\nseven thousand pounds a year._\n_He was Educated in his younger years according to the manner of his\nCountry (and as he himself recommends in one of his Epistles, ~viz.\nEpist. 90. partis secund\u00e6~ to One for the Instruction of his Son) in the\nAristotelian principles of Philosophy, a whole course whereof he had\nrun through at the Age of seventeen in the Schools of ~Flexia~, or ~La\nFlesche~ a Town in the Province of ~Anjou~, famous for the Colledge of\nJesuites there establish\u2019d by ~Henry~ the ~4th~._\n_But to this he did not Continue long devoted, giving early testimonies\nof his dislike to the unsatisfactory Notions, and verbose emptiness of\nthe Peripatetick Philosophy; He used therefore his utmost endeavours (as\nhe himself testifies in his ~Dissertatio de Methodo~) to get loose from\nthose Chains and Fetters of Mind to which the weakness of his tender\nyears had subjected him._\n_To this end he betook himself to a long course of Travel, that by the\nvariety of Objects, which he was likely to meet with in his journeys,\nthe memory of his past Notions might be blotted out; In his travel he\napplied himself much to the study of the Art Military, and Mathematicks;\nIn the latter he has left the World large testimonies of his Excellence\nin his ~Book of Geometry~; and in the former we have reason to believe\nhim most expert, for He was personally present at some Sieges and Battles\nboth in ~France~ and ~Germany~, as particularly at the Siege of ~Rochel~,\nof ~Gava~ near ~Genoa~, of ~Breda~, at the Battle of ~Prague~, ~&c.~ so\nthat we may conclude that he had a Genius fitted (according to the Motto\nof the noble ~Sir W. Raliegh~) ~Tam Marti, quam Mercurio~, For the Pike\nas well as Pen. And as the Glorious Roman Emperour became a ~C\u00e6sar~ by\nhis Book as well as Sword, by the Conquests of his mind as well as those\nof his arm; so our Famous Author was ~Ex Utroque Clarus~._\n_In his Travels he spent many years, in all which time he was not Idle,\nbut highly improved himself by his converse with the ~Beaux Esprits~,\nwhich he met with in several Regions he visited; The first Place he\nbetook himself to, was ~Italy~, then he went into ~Denmark, Germany,\nHungary, &c.~ And after a Long but advantagious Peregrination he\nreturn\u2019d to ~Amsterdam~, where he intended to take up his Rest, had he\nnot been called by the French King upon very Honourable terms to ~Paris~;\nDuring his Continuance there he so order\u2019d his annual Revenue, that he\nmight be supplied by the hands of a Friend wherever he was. He staid at\n~Paris~ three years, and then retired Himself to a solitary village in\n~Holland~ called ~Egmond~, where he lived twenty five years, during which\ntime he apply\u2019d himself wholly to the Restauration of true Philosophy,\nwherein he gave the World such mighty testimonies of his Excellence,\nthat in a short time he became celebrated in the mouths of all Learned\nMen. Neither were the Courts of Princes silent in his deserved Praises;\nfor after a Retirement of twenty five years he was Invited by ~Christina\nQueen of Sweedland~ to her Court; Thither upon the intreaty of this brave\nand Learned Princess he betook himself, where he had not continued Long\nbefore he was struck with a Peripneumonia or Inflammation of the Lungs\n(contracted, as it is thought by the long Discourses which he used to\nhold bare headed with the Queen, continuing them sometimes till far in\nthe Night,) of which unhappy distemper he Died the seventh Day after he\nsicken\u2019d._\n_Thus Expired this Wonder of his Own and succeeding Ages, desired and\nlamented by all men, \u00c6qual\u2019d by none. He was buried in a costly Monument\nconsisting of four sides, upon which were inscribed Epitaphs; bestow\u2019d\nupon him by many Renown\u2019d Persons._\n_What shall we now say sufficient to express our Grief for the untimely\nDecease of this Worthy Philosopher? But Especially what shall we now do\nto recover our Loss? Let us endeavour to Redeem what we have lost by well\nHusbanding and careful improvement of what is left; which may be done\nin Part by a Diligent Perusal of the Works written by this Excellent\nAuthor; This, This only is the way of Reviving him again, and of giving\nhim Immortality in spight of his untimely Fate. And so let him for ever\nlive celebrated by the Deserved Praises of all ingenious Enquirers after\ntruth, and Learning._\n_Let us therefore cast our eye upon the Present Work of this\nextroardinary Philosopher, and therein let us admire his profound\nJudgment and vigorous Fancy, for if we seriously consider it, we shall\nhardly find a more solid close piece of Reasoning either in this or\nForegoing ages; ~Here~, what was commonly asserted without proof, is not\nonly proved but ~Mathematically~ Demonstrated, ~viz.~ That ~God is the\nFountain and Original of Truth~; His sharp Wit, like ~Hannibals~ Vinegar,\nhath eaten thro the Mazing and overtowring hills of Errors, a Plain and\nPleasant Way to the Divine seat of Knowledge._\n_In fine, such is the Excellence of these six Meditations, that I cannot\nresemble his Performance herein better than to the Six Days Work of the\nSupream Architect; and certainly next to the Creation of All things out\nof Nothing, the Restauration of Truth out of Errors is the most Divine\nWork; so that (with Reverence be it spoken) the Incomparable ~Des-Cartes~\ndoes hereby deserve as it were the name of a Creatour. In the first\nMeditation we are Presented with a Rude and Indigested Chaos of Errours\nand Doubts, till the Divine spirit of the Noble ~Des-Cartes~ (pardon\nthe Boldness of the Expression) ~moves upon the confused face of these\nWaters~, and thereout produces some ~clear~ and ~distinct Light~; by\nwhich ~Sun-shine~ he proceeds to bring forth and cherish other ~Branches\nof Truth~; Till at last by a six Days Labour he Establishes this Fair\nFabrick (as I may call it) of the ~Intellectual World~ on foundations\nthat shall never be shaken. Then sitting down with rest and satisfaction\nhe looks upon this his Off-spring and Pronounces it ~Good~._\n_These Things Consider\u2019d, I need not make any long Apologies for my\nundertaking a translation thereof; The excellency of the Original is\nsufficient to vindicate my endeavours to present the English World with\na Copy, and he that shall blame my Intentions of Communicating the\nMethods of Truth to those that have only the English Tongue, may as well\nfind fault with those English that propagate the Christian Religion\namong savage Indians, and translate the Scriptures into their Language,\nbecause they have not the English Tongue. To understand Latin is no (or\nat most a very small) part of Learning, and that which certainly every\nCobler in ~Rome~ was once endow\u2019d with; and therefore must there then\nbe no translations out of Greek into Latin? I doubt not, but there are\nmany Persons in our Nations, who tho wanting Latin, are notwithstanding\nvery capable of the most abstracted speculations; the late disturbances\nof our Kingdomes occasion\u2019d many Youths, who were then in a fair way\nof Instruction, to forsake their learning, and divert their intentions\nfrom Literature to Arms, and yet many of these have afterwards become\nMen of extraordinary nary abilities and qualifications for learning\nnotwithstanding their deficiency in the Roman Tongue. And I see no Reason\nwhy it should not be the desire, and consequently the endeavour of\nevery true English man, to make his language as universal as is now the\n~French~, into which the best Books in all sorts of Learning, both Poetry\nand Prose, are daily translated out of all languages, but especially\nout of Greek and Latine. Among which these Meditations are to be found,\nentituled, ~Les Meditations Metaphysiques De Rene Des Cartes touchant\nla Premiere Philosophie~. This was translated out of the Authors Latine\ninto French by ~Monsieur le D. D. L. N. S.~ The several Objections also,\nwhich were made by divers learned Persons against these Meditations, with\nthe Authors Answers, were translated into French by ~M. B. L. R.~ And, I\nhope, no one will assert, that the French are more fit to receive those\nmetaphysical Notions delivered herein than the English Nation._\n_But \u2019twas none of the smallest motives I had to this undertaking, that\ntho some famous English Authours have taken notice of the Arguments here\nproduced (for the proof of a ~Deity~ drawn from the ~Idea~ we have of\n~God~ in our Mind, ~&c.~) Particularly the most excellent and learned\n~Dr. Stillingfleet~ in the first Chapter of the third Book in his\n~Origines Sacr\u00e6~, who refers his Readers to a further search into these\nMeditations in the ~400 page~ of that Discourse; as also the Reverend Dr.\n~Henry More~ in his ~Antidote against Atheism~, and more fully in his\n~Appendix~ annex\u2019d thereto, hath treated of our Authors demonstration;\nand yet nothing of the genuine original from whence they have borrowed\nall their Copies (tho some of them drawn in a larger size, yet I question\nwhether so expressive) nothing of our Authors proper management hath ever\nappear\u2019d in English. Those that assert these Arguments to have been long\nbefore thought upon by some of the Fathers, I shall refer to our Authors\njust vindication of himself in his several Answers to Objections made\nagainst these Discourses._\n_And here I shall dismiss the Reader detaining him no longer from\nthat satisfaction which he may reasonably expect from the perusal of\nthe following Meditations; this Translation is dedicated to no one in\nparticular, but is humbly submitted to the moderate censure of all candid\nReaders, by_\nTheir humble servant\nWill.

I.\n_Of Things Doubtful._\nSome years past I perceived how many _Falsities_ I admitted as _Truths_\nin my Younger years, and how _Dubious_ those things were which I raised\nfrom thence; and therefore I thought it requisite (if I had a designe\nto establish any thing that should prove _firme_ and _permanent_ in\nsciences) that once in my life I should clearly cast aside all my former\nopinions, and begin a new from some _First principles_. But this seemed a\ngreat Task, and I still expected that maturity of years, then which none\ncould be more apt to receive Learning; upon which Account I waited so\nlong, that at last I should deservedly be blamed had I spent that time in\n_Deliberation_ which remain\u2019d only for _Action_.\nThis day therefore I conveniently released my mind from all cares, I\nprocured to my self a Time Quiet, and free from all Business, I retired\nmy self Alone; and now at length will I freely and seriously apply my\nself to the General overthrow of all my former Opinions.\nTo the Accomplishment of Which, it will not be necessary for me to prove\nthem all _false_ (for that perhaps I shall never atcheive) But because my\nreason perswades me, that I must withdraw my assent no less from those\nopinions which seem _not so very certain_ and _undoubted_, then I should\nfrom those that are _Apparently false_, it will be sufficient if I reject\nall those wherein I find any _Occasion_ of doubt.\nNeither to effect this is it necessary, that they all should be run\nover particularly (which would be an endles trouble) but because the\n_Foundation_ being once undermin\u2019d, whatever is built thereon will of\nits own accord come to the ground, I shall therefore immediately assault\nthe very _principle_, on which whatever I have believed was _grounded_.\nViz.\n_Whatever I have hitherto admitted as most true, that I received either\nfrom, or by my Senses; but these I have often found to deceive me, and\n\u2019tis prudence never certainly to trust those that I have (tho but once)\ndeceived us._\n1 _Doubt._ But tho sometimes the _senses_ deceive us being exercised\nabout _remote_ or _small_ objects, yet there are many other things of\nwhich we cannot doubt tho we know them only by the senses? as that at\npresent I am in this place, that I am sitting by a fire, that I have a\nWinter gown on me, that I feel this Paper with my hands; But how can it\nbe denied that these hands or this body is mine? Unless I should compare\nmy self to those mad men, whose brains are disturbed by such a disorderly\nmelancholick vapour, that makes them continually profess themselves to\nbe Kings, tho they are very poor, or fancy themselves cloathed in Purple\nRobes, tho they are naked, or that their heads are made of Clay as a\nbottle, or of glass, _&c._ But these are mad men, and I should be as mad\nas they in following their example by fancying these things as they do.\n1 _Solution._ This truly would seem very clear to those that never\n_sleep_, and suffer the same things (and sometimes more unlikely) in\ntheir repose, then these mad men do whilst they are awake; for how often\nam I perswaded in a Dream of these usual occurrences, that I am in this\nplace, that I have a Gown on me, that I am sitting by a fire, _&c._ Tho\nall the while I am lying naked between the Sheets.\nBut now I am certain that I am awake and look upon this Paper, neither\nis this head which I shake asleep, I knowingly and willingly stretch out\nthis hand, and am sensible that things so distinct could not happen to\none that sleeps. As if I could not remember my self to have been deceived\nformerly in my sleep by the like thoughts; which while I consider more\nattentively I am so far convinced of the difficulty of distinguishing\nsleep from waking that I am amazed, and this very amazement almost\nperswades me that I am asleep.\n2 _Doubt._ Wherefore let us suppose our selves _asleep_, and that these\nthings are not _true_, viz. that we open our eyes, move our heads,\nstretch our hands, and perhaps that we have no such things as hands or a\nbody. Yet we must confess, that what we see in a Dream is (as it were)\n_a painted Picture_, which cannot be devised but after the _likeness_ of\nsome _real_ thing; and that therefore these Generals at least, _viz._\neyes, head, hands, and the whole body are things _really existent_ and\nnot _imaginary_; For Painters themselves, (even then when they design\nMermaids and Satyrs in the most unusual shapes) do not give them natures\naltogether new, but only add the divers Parts of different Animals\ntogether; And if by chance they invent any thing so new that nothing\nwas ever seen like it, for that \u2019tis wholy fictitious and false, yet\nthe colours at least of which, they make it must be _true Colours_; so\nupon the same account, tho these General things as eyes, head, hands,\n_&c._ may be imaginary; yet nevertheless we must of necessity confess\nthe more _simple_ and _universal_ things to be _True_, of which (as of\ntrue Colours) these _Images_ of things (whether _true_ or _false_) which\nare in our minds are made; such as are the nature of a body in General,\nand its Extension, also the shape of things extended, with the quantity\nor bigness of them; their number also, and place wherein they are, the\ntime in which they continue, and the like, and therefore from hence we\nmake no bad conclusion, that _Physick_, both _Natural_, and _Medicinal_,\n_Astronomy_, and all other _sciences_, which depend on the consideration\nof _compound things_, are _Doubtful_. But that _Arithmetick_, _Geometry_,\nand the like (which treat only of the most _simple_, and _General_ things\nnot regarding whether they really are or not) have in them something\n_certain_ and _undoubted_; for whether I sleep or wake, _two_ and _three_\nadded make five; a _square_ has no more sides than _four_ _&c._ neither\nseems it possible what such _plain truths_ can be _doubted_ off.\n2 _Solution._ But all this While there is rooted in my mind a certain old\nopinion of the _being_ of an _Omnipotent God_, by whom I am _created_ in\nthe state I am in; and how know I but he caused that there should be no\nEarth, no Heaven, no Body, no Figure, no Magnitude, no Place, and yet\nthat all these things should seem to me to be as now they are? And as I\nvery often judge others to Erre about those things which they think they\n_Throughly understand_, so why may not I be _deceived_, whenever I add\n_two_ and _three_, or count the sides of a Square, or whatever other easy\nMatter can be thought of?\n3. _Doubt_. But perhaps _God wills not_ that I should be _deceived_, for\nhe is said to be _Infinitely Good_.\n3. _Solution._ Yet if it were _Repugnant_ to his _Goodness_ to create\nme so that I should be _always deceived_, it seems also _unagreeable_\nto his _Goodness_ to permit me to be deceived _at any time_; Which\nlast no one will affirme: Some there are truely who had rather deny\n_Gods Omnipotence_, then beleive all things _uncertain_; but there at\npresent we may not contradict. And we will suppose all this of _God_ to\nbe _false_; yet whether they will suppose me to become what _I_ am by\nFate, by _Chance_, by a _continued chain_ of _causes_, or any other way,\nbecause to _erre_ is an _Imperfection_, by how much the less _power_ they\nwill Assigne to the _Author_ of my _Being_, so much the more Probable it\nwill be, that I am so _Imperfect_ as to be _alwayes deceived_.\nTo which Arguments I know not what to answer but am forced to confess,\nthat there is nothing of all those things which I formerly received as\n_Truths_, whereof at present I may not _doubt_; and this doubt shall not\nbe grounded on inadvertency or Levity, but upon strong and Premeditated\nreasons; and therefore I must hereafter (if I designe to discover\nany truths) withdraw my assent from them no less then from _apparent\nfalshoods_.\nBut \u2019tis not sufficient to think only _Transiently_ on these things, but\nI must take care to _remember_ them; for dayly my old opinions returne\nupon me, and much against my Will almost possesse my Beleife tyed to\nthem, as it were by a continued _use_ and _Right_ of _Familiarity_;\nneither shall I ever cease to _assent_ and _trust_ in them, whilst I\nsuppose them as in themselves they really are, that is to say, _something\ndoubtful_ (as now I have proved) yet notwithstanding _highly Probable_,\nwhich it is much more Reasonable to beleive then disbeleive.\nWherefore I conceive I should not do amiss, if (with my mind bent clearly\nto the contrary side) I should deceive my self, and suppose them for a\nWhile altogether _false_ and _Imaginary_; till at length the Weights of\nprejudice being equal in each scale, no ill custome may any more Draw my\nJudgement from the _true Conception_ of things, for I know from hence\nwill follow no dangerous Error, and I can\u2019t too immoderately pamper my\nown Incredulity, seeing What I am about, concernes not _Practice_ but\n_Speculation_.\nTo Which end I will suppose, not an _Infinitely perfect God_, the\n_Fountain_ of _truth_, but that some _Evil Spirit_ which is very\n_Powerful_ and _crafty_ has used all his endeavours to _deceive_ me; I\nwill conceive, the Heavens, Air, Earth, Colours, Figures, Sounds, and all\noutward things are nothing else but the delusions of Dreams, by which he\nhas laid snares to catch my easy beleif; I will consider my self as not\nhaving hands, Eyes, Flesh, Blood, or Sences, but that _I_ falsely think\nthat _I_ have all these; _I_ will continue firmly in this Meditation; and\ntho it lyes not in my power to _discover any truth_, yet this is in my\npower, not to _assent to Falsities_, and with a strong resolution take\ncare that the _Mighty deceiver_ (tho never so _powerful_ or _cunning_)\nimpose not any thing on my beleife.\nBut this is a laborious intention, and a certain sloth reduces me to\nthe usual course of life, and like a Prisoner who in his sleep perhaps\nenjoy\u2019d an imaginary liberty, and when he begins to suppose that he\nis asleep is afraid to waken, but is willing to be deceived by the\n_Pleasant delusion_; so I willingly fall into my opinions, and am afraid\nto be Roused, least a toilsome waking succeeding a pleasant rest I may\nhereafter live not in the _light_, but in the confused _darkness_ of the\n_doubts_ now raised.\nMEDITAT. II.\n_~Of the nature of Mans mind~, and that \u2019tis easier proved to ~be~ then\nour ~body~._\nBy yesterdays Meditation I am cast into so great _Doubts_, that I shall\nnever forget them, and yet I know not how to answer them, but being\nplunged on a suddain into a deep Gulf, I am so amazed that I can neither\ntouch the bottome, nor swim at the top.\nNevertheless, I will endeavour once more, and try the way I set on\nyesterday, by removing from me whatever is in the _least doubtful_, as if\nI had certainly discover\u2019d it to be _altogether false_, and will proceed\ntill I find out some _certainty_, or if nothing else, yet at least this\n_certainty, That there is nothing sure_.\n_Archimedes_ required but a _point_ which was _firm_, and _immoveable_\nthat he might move the _whole Earth_, so in the perfect undertaking Great\nthings may be expected, if I can discover but the _least thing_ that is\n_true_ and _indisputable_.\nWherefore I suppose all things I see are _false_, and believe that\nnothing of those things are really existent, which my deceitful memory\nrepresents to me; \u2019tis evident I have no senses, that a Body, Figure,\nExtension, Motion, Place, _&c._ are meer Fictions; what thing therefore\nis there that is _true_? perhaps only _this, That there is nothing\ncertain._\n[Sidenote: _Doubts and Solutions._]\nBut how know I that there is nothing _distinct_ from all these things\n(which I have now reckon\u2019d) of which I have no reason to _doubt_? Is\nthere no _God_ (or whatever other name I may call him) who has put these\nthoughts into me? Yet why should I think this? When I my self perhaps\nam the _Author_ of them. Upon which Account, therefore must not I be\nsomething? \u2019tis but just now that I denied that I had any _senses_, or\nany _Body_. Hold a while\u2014Am I so tied to a _Body_ and _senses_ that I\ncannot _exist_ without them? But I have perswaded my self that there is\nnothing in the World, no Heaven, no Earth, no Souls, no Bodies; and then\nwhy not, that I _my self am not_? Yet surely if _I_ could perswade my\nself any thing, _I was_.\nBut there is _I_ know not what sort of _Deceivour_ very _powerful_\nand very _crafty_, who always strives to _deceive_ Me; without Doubt\ntherefore _I am_, if he can _decieve me_; And let him _Deceive_ me as\nmuch as he can, yet he can never make me _not to Be_, whilst _I think\nthat I am_. Wherefore _I_ may lay this down as a _Principle, that\nwhenever this sentence I am, I exist, is spoken or thought of by Me, \u2019tis\nnecessarily True_.\nBut _I_ do not yet fully understand _who I am_ that now necessarily\n_exist_, and _I_ must hereafter take care, least _I_ foolishly _mistake_\nsome other thing _for my self_, and by that means be _deceived_ in that\nthought, which _I_ defend as the most _certain_ and _evident_ of all.\nWherefore _I_ will again Recollect, what _I_ believed _my self to be_\nheretofore, before _I_ had set upon these Meditations, from which _Notion\nI_ will withdraw whatever may be _Disproved_ by the _Foremention\u2019d\nReasons_, that in the End, _That_ only may Remain which is _True_ and\n_indisputable_.\nWhat therefore have I heretofore thought my self? _A Man._ But what is a\nman? Shall I answer, a _Rational Animal_? By no means; because afterwards\nit may be asked, what an _Animal_ is? and what _Rational_ is? And so from\none _question_ I may fall into greater _Difficulties_; neither at present\nhave I so much time as to spend it about such Niceties.\nBut I shall rather here Consider, what heretofore represented it self\nto my thoughts _freely_, and _naturally_, whenever I set my self to\nunderstand _What I my self was_.\nAnd the first thing I find Representing it self is, that I have _Face_,\n_Hands_, _Arms_, and this whole _frame_ of _parts_ which is seen in my\n_Body_, and which I call my _Body_.\nThe next thing represented to me was, that I was _nourish\u2019d_, could\n_walk_, had _senses_, and could _Think_; which functions I attributed to\nmy _Soul_. Yet what this _soul_ of mine was, I did not fully conceive; or\nelse supposed it a small thing like _wind_, or _fire_, or _aire_, infused\nthrough my _stronger parts_.\nAs to my _Body_ truly _I_ doubted not, but that _I_ rightly understood\nits _Nature_, which (if _I_ should endeavour to describe as _I_ conceive\nit) _I_ should thus Explain, _viz._ By a _Body_ _I_ mean whatever is\n_capable_ of _Shape_, or can be _contained_ in a _place_, and so fill\u2019s\na space that it excludes all other _Bodys_ out of the same, that which\nmay be _touch\u2019d_, _seen_, _heard_, _tasted_, or _smelt_, and that which\nis _capable_ of _various_ _Motions_ and _Modifications_, not from it\n_self_, but from any _other thing moving_ it, for _I_ judged it _against_\n(or rather _above_) the _nature_ of a _Body_ to _move it self_, or\n_perceive_, or _think_, But rather admired that _I_ should find these\n_Operations_ in certain _Bodys_.\nBut How now (since _I_ suppose a certain _powerful_ and (if it be lawful\nto call him so) _evil deluder_, who useth all his endeavours to deceive\nme in all things) can _I_ affirme that I have any of those things,\nwhich I have now said belong to the _nature_ of a _Body_? Hold\u2014 Let me\nConsider\u2014, Let me think\u2014, Let me reflect\u2014 I can find no Answer, and I am\nweary with repeating the same things over-again in vain.\nBut Which of these _Faculties_ did I attribute to my _Soul_, my\n_Nutritive_, or _Motive faculty_? yet now seeing I have no _Body_, these\nalso are _meer delusions_. Was it my _sensitive faculty_? But this also\ncannot be perform\u2019d without a _Body_, and I have seem\u2019d to _perceive_\nmany things in my _sleep_, of which I afterwards understood my self _not_\nto be _sensible_. Was it my _Cogitative Faculty_? Here I have discovered\nit, \u2019tis my _Thought_, this alone cannot be separated from Me, I _am_,\nI _exist_,\u2e3a_tis true_, but for what time _Am I_? Why _I am_ as long as\n_I think_; For it May be that When I cease from _thinking_, I may cease\nfrom being. Now I admit of nothing but what is necessarily true: In\nshort therefore I _am_ only a _thinking thing_ that is to say, a _mind_,\nor a _soul_, or _understanding_, or _Reason_, words which formerly _I_\nunderstood not; I am a _Real thing_, and _Really Existent_, But what sort\nof thing? I have just now said it, _A thinking thing_.\n[Sidenote: * _Places noted with their Asterisk are refer\u2019d to in the\nfollowing Objections._]\nBut am I nothing besides? I will consider\u2e3aI am not that _structure_ of\n_parts_, which is called a Mans _Body_, neither am I any sort of _thin\nAir_ infused into those Parts, nor a _Wind_, nor _Fire_, nor _Vapour_,\nnor _Breath_, nor whatever I my self can feign, for all these things I\nhave supposed _not to Be_. Yet my Position stands firm; _Nevertheless I\nam something._ Yet perhaps it so falls out that these very things which\nI suppose not to exist (because to me _unknown_) are in reallity nothing\n_different_ from that very _Self_, which I _know_. I cannot tell, I\ndispute it not now, I can only give my opinion of those things whereof I\nhave some knowledge. I am sure that I exist, I ask who I am whom I thus\nknow, certainly, the knowledge, of _Me_ (precisely taken) depends not on\nthose things, whose existence I am yet ignorant of; and therefore not on\nany other things that I can _feign_ by my _imagination_.\nAnd this very Word (_feign_) puts me in mind of my _error_, for I\nshould _feign_ in deed, if I should _imagine_ my self any thing; for to\n_imagine_ is nothing else but to think upon the _shape_ or _image_ of\na _corporeal_ thing; but now I certainly know that I _am_, and I know\nalso that \u2019tis possible that all these _images_, and generally whatever\nbelongs to the _Nature_ of a _Body_ are nothing but _deluding Dreams_.\nWhich things Consider\u2019d I should be no less Foolish in saying, _I will\nimagine that I may more throughly understand what I am_, then if I should\nsay, _at Present I am awake and perceive something true, but because it\nappears not evidently enough, I shall endeavour to sleep, that in a Dream\nI may perceive it more evidently and truely_.\nWherefore I know that nothing that I can comprehend by my _imagination_,\ncan belong to the _Notion_ I have of _my self_, and that I must carefully\nwithdraw my mind from those things that it may more _distinctly_ perceive\nits _own Nature_.\nLet me ask therefore _What I am, A Thinking Thing_, but What is That?\nThat is a thing, _doubting_, _understanding_, _affirming_, _denying_,\n_willing_, _nilling_, _imagining_ also, and _sensitive_. These truely are\nnot a few _Properties_, if they all belong to Me. And Why should they Not\nbelong to me? For am not I the very same who at present _doubt_ almost of\nAll things; yet _understand_ something, which thing onely I _affirm_ to\nbe true, I _deny_ all other things, I am _willing_ to know more, I _would\nnot_ be deceived, I _imagine_ many things _unwillingly_, and _consider_\nmany things as coming to me by my _senses_. Which of all these faculties\nis it, which is not as _true_ as that I _Exist_, tho I should _sleep_, or\nmy _Creatour_ should as much as in him lay, strive to _deceive_ Me? which\nof them is it that is _distinct_ from my _thought_? which of them is it\nthat can be _seperated_ from _me_? For that I am the same that _doubt_,\n_understand_, and _will_ is so _evident_, that I know not how to explain\nit more _manifestly_, and that I also am the same that _imagine_, for tho\nperhaps (as I have supposed) no thing that can be _imagined_ is _true_,\nyet the _imaginative Power_ it self is _really_ existent, and makes\nup a part of my _Thought_; and last of all that I am the same that am\n_sensitive_, or _perceive corporeal_ things as by my _senses_, yet that\nI now _see_ light, _hear_ a noise, _feel_ heat, these things are false,\nfor I suppose my self _asleep_, but I _know_ that I _see_, _hear_, and am\n_heated_, that cannot be _false_; and this it is that in me is _properly_\ncalled _Sense_, and this strictly taken is the same with _thought_.\nBy these Considerations I begin a little better to _understand My self_\nwhat I am; But yet it _seems_, and I cannot but _think_ that _Corporeal\nThings_ (whose _Images_ are formed in my _thought_, and which by my\n_senses_, I perceive) are much more _distinctly known_, then that\n_confused Notion_ of _My Self_ which _imagination_ cannot afford me. And\nyet \u2019tis strange that things _doubtful_, _unknown_, _distinct from Me_,\nshould be _apprehended_ more _clearly_ by _Me_, then a Thing that is\n_True_, then a thing that is _known_, or then _I my self_; But the Reason\nis, that my Mind loves to wander, and suffers not it self to be bounded\nwithin the strict limits of _Truth_.\nLet it therefore Wander, and once more let me give it the Free Reins,\nthat hereafter being conveniently curbed, it may suffer it self to be\nmore easily Govern\u2019d.\nLet me consider those things which of all Things I formerly conceived\nmost _evident_, that is to say, _Bodies_ which we touch, which we see,\nnot bodies in General (for those _General_ Conceptions are usually\n_Confused_) but some one _Body_ in particular.\nLet us chuse for example this piece of _Bees-wax_, it was lately taken\nfrom the _Comb_, it has not yet lost all the _tast_ of the _Honey_,\nit retains something of the _smell_ of the _Flowers_ from whence \u2019twas\ngather\u2019d, its _colour_, _shape_, and _bigness_ are manifest, \u2019tis _hard_,\n\u2019tis _cold_, \u2019tis _easily felt_, and if you will knock it with your\nfinger, \u2019twill _make a noise_: In fine, it hath all things requisite to\nthe most perfect notion of a _Body_.\nBut behold whilst I am speaking, \u2019tis put to the Fire, its _tast_ is\npurged away, the _smell_ is vanish\u2019d, the _colour_ is changed, the\n_shape_ is alter\u2019d, its _bulk_ is increased, its become _soft_, \u2019tis\n_hot_, it can scarce be _felt_, and now (though you strike it) it makes\nno _noise_. Does it yet continue the same Wax? surely it does, this\nall confess, no one denies it, no one doubts it. What therefore was\nthere in it that was so evidently known? surely none of those things\nwhich I _perceived_ by my _senses_; for what I _smelt_, _tasted_,\nhave _seen_, _felt_, or _heard_, are all _vanish\u2019d_, and yet the _Wax\nremains_. Perhaps \u2019twas this only that I now think on, _viz._ that the\n_Wax_ it self was not that _tast of Honey_, that _smell of Flowers_,\nthat _whiteness_, that _shape_, or that _sound_, but it was a _Body_\nwhich awhile before appear\u2019d to me _so_ and _so modified_, but now\n_otherwise_. But what is it strictly that I thus imagine? let me\nconsider: And having rejected whatever belongs not to the Wax, let me\nsee what will remain, _viz._ this only, a _thing extended_, _flexible_,\nand _mutable_. But what is this _flexible_, and _mutable_? is it that\nI _imagine_ that this Wax from being _round_ may be made _square_, or\nfrom being _square_ can be made _triangular_? No, this is not it; for I\nconceive it capable of _innumerable_ such _changes_, and yet I cannot by\nmy _imagination_ run over these _Innumerables_; Wherefore this notion\nof its _mutability_ proceeds not from my _imagination_. What then is\n_extended_? is not its _Extension_ also _unknown_? For when it _melts_\n\u2019tis _greater_, when it _boils_ \u2019tis _greater_, and yet _greater_ when\nthe heat is increas\u2019d; and I should not rightly judge of the Wax, did I\nnot think it capable of more various _Extensions_ than I can _imagine_.\nIt remains therefore for me only to confess, that I cannot _imagine_ what\nthis Wax is, but that I _perceive_ with my _Mind_ what it is. I speak\nof this _particular_ Wax, for of Wax in _general_ the _notion_ is more\n_clear_.\nBut what Wax is this that I only conceive by my mind? \u2019Tis the same\nwhich I see, which I touch, which I imagine, and in fine, the same\nwhich at first I judged it to be. But this is to be noted, that the\n_perception_ thereof is not _sight_, the _touch_, or the _imagination_\nthereof; neither was it ever so, though at first it seem\u2019d so. But the\n_perception_ thereof is the _inspection_ or _beholding_ of the Mind only,\nwhich may be either _imperfect_ and _confused_, as formerly it was; or\n_clear_ and _distinct_, as now it is; the _more_ or the _less_ I consider\nthe Composition of the Wax.\nIn the interim, I cannot but admire how prone my mind is to erre; for\nthough I revolve these things with my self _silently_, and _without\nspeaking_, yet am I intangled in _meer words_, and am almost deceived\nby the usual way of _expression_; for we commonly say, _that we see the\nWax it self if it be present_, and not, _that we judge it present by\nits colour or shape_; from whence I should immediately thus conclude,\ntherefore the Wax is known by the _sight_ of the _eye_, and not by the\n_inspection_ of the _mind_ only. Thus I should have concluded, had not\nI by chance look\u2019d out of my window, and seen men passing by in the\nStreet; which men I as usually say that I _see_, as I do now, that I\n_see_ this Wax; and yet I see nothing but their Hair and Garments, which\nperhaps may cover only _artificial Machines_ and _movements_, but I judge\nthem to be men; so that what I thought I only _saw_ with my eyes, I\ncomprehend by my _Judicative Faculty_, which is _my Soul_. But it becomes\nnot one, who desires to be wiser than the Vulgar, to draw matter of\n_doubt_ from those ways of _expression_, which the Vulgar have invented.\nWherefore let us proceed and consider, whether I perceived more\n_perfectly_ and _evidently_ what the Wax was, when I first look\u2019d on\u2019t,\nand believed that I knew it by my outward _senses_, or at least by my\n_common sense_ (as they call it) that is to say, _by my imagination_; or\nwhether at present I _better understand_ it, after I have more diligently\nenquired both _what it is_, and how it may be _known_. Surely it would be\na foolish thing to make it matter of doubt to know which of these parts\nare true; What was there in my first _perception_ that was _distinct?_\nWhat was there that seem\u2019d not incident to every other Animal? But now\nwhen I distinguish the Wax from its outward adherents, and consider it\nas if it were naked, with it\u2019s coverings pull\u2019d off, then I cannot but\nreally perceive it with my mind, though yet perhaps my judgment may erre.\nBut what shall I now say as to my _mind_, or my _self_? (for as yet\nI admit nothing as belonging to me but a _mind_.) Why (shall I say?)\nshould not I, who seem to perceive this Wax so _distinctly_, know my\n_self_ not only more _truly_ and more _certainly_, but more _distinctly_\nand _evidently_? For if I judge that _this Wax exists_, because I _see_\nthis Wax; surely it will be much more _evident_, that I _my self exist_,\nbecause _I see this Wax_; for it may be that this that I see is not\nreally Wax, also it may be that I have no eyes wherewith to see any\nthing; but it cannot be, when I _see_, or (which is the same thing) when\n_I think that I see_, that I who _think_ should not _exist_. The same\nthing will follow if I _judge that this Wax exists_, because I _touch_,\nor _imagine_ it, &c. And what has been said of Wax, may be apply\u2019d to all\nother outward things.\nMoreover, if the _notion_ of Wax seems more _distinct_ after it is made\nknown to me, not only by my _sight_ or _touch_, but by more and other\ncauses; How much the more _distinctly_ must I confess my _self known_\nunto my _self_, seeing that all sort of reasoning which furthers me in\nthe _perception_ of _Wax_, or any other _Body_, does also encrease the\nproofs of the _nature_ of my _Mind_. But there are so many more things\nin the very _Mind_ it self, by which the _notion_ of it may be made more\n_distinct_, that those things which drawn from _Body_ conduce to its\nknowledge are scarce to be _mention\u2019d_.\nAnd now behold of my own accord am I come to the place I would be in;\nfor seeing I have now discover\u2019d that _Bodies themselves_ are not\n_properly perceived_ by our _senses_ or _imagination_, but only by our\n_understanding_, and are not therefore _perceived_, because they are\n_felt_ or _seen_, but because they are _understood_; it plainly appears\nto me, that nothing can possibly be _perceived_ by _me easier_, or more\n_evidently_, than my _Mind_.\nBut because I cannot so soon shake off the Acquaintance of my former\nOpinion, I am willing to stop here, that this my new knowledge may be\nbetter fixt in my memory the longer I meditate thereon.\nMEDITAT. III.\n_Of GOD, and that there is a God._\nNow will I shut my eyes, I will stop my ears, and withdraw all my senses,\nI will blot out the Images of _corporeal_ things clearly from my mind,\nor (because that can scarce be accomplish\u2019d) I will give no heed to\nthem, as being _vain_ and _false_, and by discoursing with my self, and\nprying more rightly into my own Nature, will endeavour to make my self by\ndegrees more known and familiar to my self.\nI am a _Thinking Thing_, that is to say, _doubting_, _affirming_,\n_denying_, _understanding_ few things, _ignorant_ of many things,\n_willing_, _nilling_, _imagining_ also, and _sensitive_. For (as before\nI have noted) though perhaps whatever I _imagine_, or am sensible of,\nas without me, _Is not_; yet that _manner_ of _thinking_ which I\ncall _sense_ and _imagination_ (as they are only certain _Modes_ of\n_Thinking_) I am certain are in Me. So that in these few Words I have\nmention\u2019d whatever I _know_, or at least Whatever as yet I _perceive_ my\nself to _know_.\nNow will I look about me more carefully to see Whether there Be not some\nother Thing in Me, of Which I have not yet taken Notice. I am sure That\nI am a _Thinking Thing_, and therefore Do not I know what is Required to\nmake _certain_ of any Thing? I Answer, that in this My _first knowledge_\n\u2019tis Nothing but a _clear_, and _distinct perception_ of What I affirm,\nWhich would not be sufficient to make me _certain_ of the _Truth_ of\na Thing, if it were _Possible_ that any thing that I so _clearly_ and\n_distinctly_ Perceive should be _false_. Wherefore I may lay this Down as\na _Principle_. _Whatever I Clearly and Distinctly perceive is certainly\nTrue._\nBut I have formerly Admitted of many Things as very _Certain_ and\n_manifest_, Which I afterwards found to be _doubtful_. Therefore What\nsort of Things were they? _Viz._ Heaven, Earth, Stars, and all other\nthings which I perceived by my _Senses_. But What did I Perceive of\nThese _Clearly? Viz._ That I had the _Ideas_ or _Thoughts_ of these\nthings in my mind, and at Present I cannot deny that I have these _Ideas_\nin Me. But there was some other thing Which I affirm\u2019d, and Which (by\nReason of the common Way of Belief) I thought that I _Clearly_ Perceived;\nWhich nevertheless, I did not really Perceive; And that was, that there\nwere Certain Things _Without Me_ from whence these _Ideas Proceeded_, and\nto which they were exactly like. And this it was, Wherein I was either\n_Deceived_, or if by Chance I Judged _truly_, yet it Proceeded not from\nthe strength of my _Perception_.\nBut When I was exercised about any single and easie Proposition in\nArithmetick or Geometry, as that two and three added make five, Did not\nI Perceive them _Clearly_ enough to make me affirm them True? Truly\nconcerning these I had no other Reason afterwards to _Doubt_, but That I\nthought Perhaps there may be a _God_ who might have so created me, that\nI should be _Deceived_ even in those things which seem\u2019d most _Clear_ to\nme. And as often as this Pre-conceived opinion of _Gods great Power_\ncomes into my Mind, I cannot but Confess that he may easily cause me to\nErr even in those things which I Think I perceive most _Evidently_ with\nmy Mind; yet as often as I Consider the Things themselves, which I Judge\nmy self to perceive so _Clearly_, I am so fully Perswaded by them, that I\neasily Break out into these Expressions, Let Who can Deceive Me, yet he\nshall never Cause me _Not to Be_ whilst _I think that I Am_, or that it\nshall ever be True, _that I never was_, Whilst at Present \u2019tis True _that\nI am_, or Perhaps, that Two and Three added make More or Less then Five;\nfor in These things I Percieve a Manifest Repugnancy; And truely seeing\nI have no reason to Think any _God_ a _Deceiver_, Nor as yet fully know\nWhether there Be _any God_, or _Not_, \u2019Tis but a slight and (as I may\nsay) Metaphysical Reason of Doubt, which depends only on that opinion of\nwhich I am not yet Perswaded.\nWherefore That this Hindrance may be taken away, When I have time I ought\nto Enquire, Whether there _Be a God_, And if there be One, Whether he can\nbe a _Deceiver_, For whilst I am _Ignorant_ of this, I cannot possibly\nbe fully _Certain_ of any Other thing.\nBut now Method seems to Require Me to Rank all My Thoughts under certain\nHeads, and to search in Which of them _Truth_ or _Falshood_ properly\nConsists. Some of them are (as it were) the _Images_ of Things, and to\nthese alone the Name of an _Idea_ properly belongs, as When I think upon\na Man, A Chimera or Monster, Heaven, an Angel, or _God_. But there are\nothers of them, that have _superadded Forms_ to them, as when I Will,\nwhen I Fear, when I Affirm, when I Deny. I know I have alwayes (when ever\nI think) some certain Thing as the _subject_ or _object_ of my Thought,\nbut in this last sort of thoughts there is something _more_ which I Think\nupon then Barely the likeness of the Thing. And of these Thoughts some\nare called _Wills_ and _Affections_, and Others of them _Judgments_.\nNow as touching _Ideas_, if they be Consider\u2019d alone as they are in\nthemselves, without _Respect_ to any other Things, they cannot Properly\nbe _false_; for Whether I _Imagine_ a Goat or a Chimera, \u2019tis as\n_Certain_ that I _Imagine_ one as t\u2019other. Also in the _Will_ and\n_Affections_ I need not Fear any _Falshood_, For tho I should _Wish_ for\n_evil Things_, or Things that are Not, it is not therefore _Not true_\nthat I Wish for them.\nWherefore there onely Remains my _Judgments_ of Things, in which I\nmust take Care that I be not _deceived_. Now the Chief and most usual\n_Error_ that I discover in them is, That I _Judge_ Those _Ideas_ that\nare _within_ me to be _Conformable_ and like to certain things that are\n_without_ Me; for truely if I Consider those Ideas as certain _Modes_ of\nmy _Thought_, without Respect to any other Thing, they will scarce afford\nme an Occasion of _Erring_.\nOf these _Ideas_ some are _Innate_, some _Adventitious_, and some Others\nseem to Me as Created by my self; For that I understand what _A Thing_\nIs, What is _Truth_, What a _Thought_, seems to Proceed meerly from my\nown _Nature_. But that I now _hear_ a Noise, _see_ the Sun, or _feel_\nheat, _I_ have alwayes _Judged_ to Proceed from Things _External_. But\nLastly, Mermaids, Griffins, and such like Monsters, are _made meerly_ by\n_My self_. And yet _I_ may well think all of them either _Adventitious_,\nor all of them _Innate_, or all of them _made by my self_, for I have not\nas yet discover\u2019d their true _Original_.\nBut _I_ ought cheifly to search after those of them which _I_ count\n_Adventitious_, and which I consider as coming from _outward objects_,\nthat I may know what reason I have to think them _like_ the things\nthemselves, which they _represent_. Viz. _Nature so teaches Me_; and also\nI know that they _depend_ not on my _Will_, and therefore _not on me_;\nfor they are often present with me against my inclinations, or (as they\nsay) in spite of my teeth, as now whether _I will_ or _no_ I feel heat,\nand therefore I think that the _sense_ or _Idea_ of heat is propagated\nto me by a _thing_ really _distinct_ from _my self_, and that is by the\n_heat_ of the _Fire_ at which I sit; And nothing is more obvious then for\nme to judge that That thing should transmit its own _Likeness_ into me,\nrather then that any other thing should be transmitted by it. Which sort\nof arguments whether firme enough or not I shall now Trie.\nWhen I here say, that _nature so teaches me_, I understand only, that\nI am as it were _willingly forced_ to beleive it, and not that \u2019tis\n_discover\u2019d_ to me to be _true_ by any _natural light_; for these two\ndiffer very much. For whatever is discover\u2019d to me by the _Light_\nof _nature_ (as that it necessarily Follows _that I am_, because _I\nthink_) cannot possibly be _doubted_; Because I am endowed with no other\n_Faculty_, in which I may put so great confidence, as I can in the\n_Light_ of _nature_; or _which_ can possibly tell me, that those things\nare _false_, which _natural light_ teaches me to be _true_; and as to\nmy _natural Inclinations_, I have heretofore often judged my self led\nby them to the election of the _worst part_, when I was in the choosing\n_one_ of two Goods; and therefore I see no reason why I should ever\n_trust_ them in any other thing.\nAnd then, tho these _Ideas depend not_ on my _will_, it does not\ntherefore follow that they _necessarily proceed_ from _things external_.\nFor as, Altho those _Inclinations_ (which I but now mention\u2019d) are in me,\nyet they seem _distinct_ and _different_ from my _will_; so perhaps there\nmay be in me some other _faculty_ (to me _unknown_) which may prove the\n_Efficient cause_ of these _Ideas_, as hitherto I have observed them\nto be formed in me whilst I _dream_, without the help of any _External\nObject_.\nAnd last of all, tho they should _proceed_ from things which are\n_different_ from me, it does not therefore follow that they must be\n_like_ those things. For often times I have found the _thing_ and the\n_Idea differing_ much. As for example, I find in my self two divers\n_Ideas_ of the Sun, _one_ as _received_ by my _senses_ (and which cheifly\nI reckon among those I call adventitious) by which it appears to me very\n_smal_, * _another_ as taken from the arguments of Astronomers (that is\nto say, _consequentially collected_, or some other ways made by me from\ncertain _natural notions_) by which \u2019tis rendred something bigger then\nthe Globe of the Earth. Certainly both of these cannot be _like_ that sun\nwhich is _without me_, and my reason perswades me, that that _Idea_ is\nmost _unlike_ the Sun, which seems to _proceed Immediately_ from it self.\nAll which things sufficiently prove, that I have hitherto (not from a\n_true judgement_, but from a _blind impulse_) beleived that there are\ncertain things _different_ from my self, and which have sent their\n_Ideas_ or _Images_ into me by the Organs of my _senses_, or some other\nway.\nBut I have yet an other Way of inquiring, whether any of those Things\n(whose _Ideas_ I have _within_ Me) are Really Existent _without_ Me;\nAnd that is Thus: As those _Ideas_ are only _Modes_ of _Thinking_, I\nacknowledge no _Inequality_ between them, and they all proceed from me\nin the _same Manner_. But as _one_ Represents _one thing_, an _other_,\nan _other Thing_, \u2019tis Evident there is a _Great difference_ between\nthem. * For without doubt, Those of them which Represent _Substances_\nare something _More_, or (as I may say) have _More_ of _Objective\nReallity_ in them, then those that Represent only _Modes_ or _Accidents_;\nand again, _That_ by Which I understand a _Mighty God_, _Eternal_,\n_Infinite_, _Omniscient_, _Omnipotent Creatour_ of all things besides\nhimself, has certainly in it _more Objective Reallity_, then Those\n_Ideas_ by which _Finite Substances_ are Exhibited.\nBut Now, it is evident by the _Light_ of _Nature_ that there must be\n_as much_ at least in the _Total efficient Cause_, as there is in the\n_Effect_ of _that Cause_; For from Whence can the _effect_ have its\n_Reallity_, but from the _Cause_? and how can the _Cause_ give it that\n_Reallity_, unless _it self have_ it?\nAnd from hence it follows, that neither a _Thing_ can be made out of\n_Nothing_, Neither a Thing which is _more Perfect_ (that is, Which has in\nit self _more Reallity_) _proceed_ from That Which is _Less Perfect_.\nAnd this is _Clearly_ True, not only in those _Effects_ whose _Actual_\nor _Formal Reallity_ is Consider\u2019d, But in Those _Ideas_ also, Whose\n_Objective Reallity_ is only Respected; That is to say, for Example of\nIllustration, it is not only impossible that a stone, Which _was not_,\nshould now begin _to Be_, unless it were produced by _something_, in\nWhich, Whatever goes to the Making a Stone, is either _Formally_ or\n_Virtually_; neither can _heat_ be Produced in any Thing, which before\nwas _not hot_, but by a Thing which is at least of as equal a _degree_ of\n_Perfection_ as _heat_ is; But also \u2019tis Impossible that I should have\nan _Idea_ of Heat, or of a _Stone_, unless it were put into me by some\n_Cause_, in which there is at Least as much _Reallity_, as I Conceive\nthere is in heat or a Stone. For tho that _Cause_ transfers none of its\nown _Actual_ or _Formal Reality_ into my _Idea_, I must not from thence\nconclude that \u2019tis _less real_; but I may think that the _nature_ of the\n_Idea_ it self is such, that of it self it requires no other _formal\nreality_, but what it has from my _thought_, of which \u2019tis a _mode_. But\nthat this Idea has _this_ or _that objective reallity_, rather then any\n_other_, proceeds clearly from some _cause_, in which there ought to be\nat least as much _formal reallity_, as there is of _objective reallity_\nin the _Idea_ it self. For if we suppose any thing in the _Idea_, which\nwas not in its _cause_, it must of necessity have this from _nothing_;\nbut (tho it be a most _Imperfect manner_ of _existing_, by which the\nthing is _objectively_ in the _Intellect_ by an _Idea_, yet) it is not\n_altogether nothing_, and therefore cannot proceed from _nothing_.\nNeither ought I to doubt, seeing the _reallity_ which I perceive in\nmy _Ideas_ is only an _objective reallity_, that therefore it must of\nnecessity follow, that the same _reallity_ should be in the _causes_\nof these _Ideas formally_. But I may conclude, that \u2019tis sufficient\nthat this _reallity_ be in the very _causes_ only _objectively_. For as\nthat _objective manner_ of _being_ appertains to the very _nature_ of\nan _Idea_, so that _formal manner_ of _being_ appertains to the very\n_nature_ of a _cause_ of _Ideas_, at least to the _first_ and _chiefest\ncauses_ of them; For tho perhaps one _Idea_ may receive its birth from\nan other, yet we cannot proceed in _Infinitum_, but at last we must\narrive at some _first Idea_, whose _cause_ is (as it were) an _Original\ncopy_, in which all the _objective reallity_ of the _Idea_ is _formally\ncontain\u2019d_. So that I plainly discover by the _light_ of _nature_, that\nthe _Ideas_, which are in me, are (as it were) _Pictures_, which may\neasily _come short_ of the _perfection_ of those things from whence they\nare taken, but cannot _contain_ any thing _greater_ or _more perfect_\nthen them: And the _longer_ and _more diligently_ I pry into these\nthings, so much the more _clearly_ and _distinctly_ do I discover them to\nbe _true_.\nBut what shall I conclude from hence? Thus, that if the _objective\nreallity_ of any of my _Ideas_ be _such_, that it cannot be in me either\n_formally_ or _eminently_, and that therefore I cannot be the _cause_\nof _that Idea_, from hence it necessarily Follows, that _I alone_ do\nnot only _exist_, but that some other thing, which is _cause_ of that\n_Idea_, does _exist also_.\nBut if I can find no _such Idea_ in me, I have no argument to perswade\nme of the _existence_ of any thing besides my self for I have diligently\nenquired, and hitherto I could discover no other _perswasive_.\nSome of these _Ideas_ there are (besides that which represents _my self_\nto _my self_, of which in this place I cannot doubt) which represent\nto me, one of them a _God_, others of them _Corporeal_ and _Inanimate_\nthings, some of them _Angels_, others _Animals_, and lastly some of them\nwhich exhibite to me _men like my self_.\nAs touching those that represent _Men_ or _Angels_ or _Animals_, I easily\nunderstand that they may be _made up_ of those _Ideas_ which I have of\n_my self_, of _Corporeal_ things, and of _God_, tho there were neither\n_man_ (but my self) nor _Angel_, nor _Animal_ in being.\nAnd as to the _Ideas_ of _Corporeal_ things, I find nothing in them of\nthat _perfection_, but it may proceed from my self; for if I look into\nthem more narrowly, and examine them more particularly, as yesterday\n(_in the second Medit._) I did the _Idea_ of Wax, I find there are but\nfew things which I perceive _clearly_ and _distinctly_ in them, viz.\n_Magnitude_ or _extension_ in _Longitude_, _Latitude_, and _Profundity_,\nthe _Figure_ or _shape_ which arises from the _termination_ of that\n_Extension_, the _Position_ or _place_ which divers _Figured Bodies_\nhave in _respect_ of each other, their _motion_ or _change of place_; to\nwhich may be added, their _substance_, _continuance_, and _number_; as to\nthe other, such as are, _Light_, _Colours_, _Sounds_, _Smels_, _Tasts_,\n_Heat_, and _Cold_, with the other _tactile qualities_, I have but very\n_obscure_ and _confused thoughts_ of them, so that I know not, whether\nthey are _true_ or _false_, that is to say, whether the _Ideas_ I have of\nthem are the _Ideas_ of _things_ which _really are_, or _are not_. For\naltho _falshood formally_ and _properly_ so called, consists only in the\n_judgement_ (as before I have observed) yet there is an other sort of\n_material falshood_ in _Ideas_, when they represent a _thing_ as _really\nexistent_, tho it does _not exist_; so, for example, the _Ideas_ I have\nof _heat_ and _cold_ are so _obscure_ and _confused_, that I cannot\ncollect from them, whether _cold_ be a _privation_ of _heat_, or _heat_ a\n_privation_ of _cold_, or whether either of them be a _real quality_, or\nwhether neither of them be _real_. And since every _Idea_ must be _like_\nthe thing it represents, if it be _true_ that _cold_ is nothing but the\n_privation_ of _heat_, that _Idea_ which represents it to me as a thing\n_real_ and _positive_ may deservedly be called _false_. The same may be\napply\u2019d to other Ideas.\nAnd now I see no necessity why I should assigne any other _Author_ of\nthese _Ideas_ but _my self_; for if they are _false_, that is, represent\nthings that _are not_, I know by the _light_ of _nature_ that they\nproceed from _nothing_; that is to say, I harbour them upon no other\naccount, but because my _nature_ is _deficient_ in something, and\n_imperfect_. But if they are _true_, yet seeing I discover so little\n_reality_ in them, that that very _reality_ scarce _seems_ to _be realy_,\nI see no reason why I my self should not be the _Author_ of them.\nBut also some of those very _Ideas_ of _Corporeal_ things which are\n_clear_ and _distinct_, I may seem to have borrow\u2019d from the _Idea_ I\nhave of _my self_, viz. _Substance_, _duration_, _number_, and the like;\nFor when I conceive a _stone_ to be a _substance_ (that is, _a thing\napt of it self to exist_) and also that I _my self_ am a _substance_,\ntho I conceive _my self_ a _thinking substance_ and _not extended_, and\nthe _stone_ an _extended substance_ and _not thinking_, by which there\nis a great _diversity_ between both the _conceptions_, yet they _agree_\nin this, that they are _both substances_. So when I conceive my self as\n_now_ in being, and also remember, that _heretofore_ I _have been_; and\nsince I have _divers_ thoughts, which I can _number_ or _count_; from\nhence it is that I come by the notions of _duration_ and _number_; which\nafterwards I apply to other things.\nAs to those other things, of which the _Idea_ of a _body_ is made up, as\n_extension_, _figure_, _place_ and _motion_, they are not _formally_ in\nme, seeing I am only a _thinking thing_; yet seeing they are only certain\n_modes_ of _substance_, and I my self also am a _substance_, they may\nseem to be in me _eminently_.\n* Wherefore there only Remains the _Idea_ of a _God_, wherein I must\nconsider whether there be not something included, which cannot possibly\nhave its _original_ from me. By the word _God_, I mean a certain\n_Infinite Substance_, _Independent_, _Omniscient_, _Almighty_, by whom\nboth _I my self_, and every thing else that _is_ (if any thing do\n_Actualy exist_) was created. All which _Attributes_ are of such an _high\nnature_, that the more attentively I consider them, the less I conceive\nmy self possible to be the _Author_ of these notions.\nFrom what therefore has been said I must conclude that there is a _God_;\nfor tho the _Idea_ of _substance_ may arise in me, because that I my\nself am a _substance_, yet I could not have the _Idea_ of an _Infinite\nsubstance_ (seeing I my self am _finite_) unless it proceeded from a\n_substance_ which is _really Infinite_. Neither ought I to think that\nI have no _true Idea_ of _Infinity_, or that I perceive it only by the\n_negation_ of what is _finite_, as I conceive _rest_ and _darkness_ by\nthe _negation_ or _absence_ of _motion_ or _light_. But on the contrary\nI plainly understand, that there is _more reality_ in an _Infinite\nsubstance_, then in a _Finite_; and that therefore the _perception_\nof an _Infinite_ (as _God_) is _antecedent_ to the _notion_ I have of\na _finite_ (as _my self_). For how should I know that I _doubt_ or\n_desire_, that is to say, that I _want_ something, and that I am _not\naltogether perfect_, unless I had the _Idea_ of a _being more perfect_\nthen _my self_, by _comparing_ my self to which I may discover my own\n_Imperfections_.\nNeither can it be said that this _Idea_ of _God_ is _false Materialiter_,\nand that therefore it _proceeds_ from _nothing_, as before I observed of\nthe _Ideas_ of _heat_ and _cold_, _&c._ For on the contrary, seeing this\n_notion_ is most _clear_ and _distinct_, and contains in it self more\n_objective reality_ then any other _Idea_, none can be more _true_ in\nit self, nor in which less _suspition_ of _falshood_ can be found. This\n_Idea_ (I say) of a _being infinitely perfect_ is most _true_, for tho\nit may be supposed that such a _being_ does _not exist_, yet it cannot\nbe supposed that the _Idea_ of such a _being_ exhibites to me nothing\n_real_, as before I have said of the _Idea_ of _cold_. This _Idea_\nalso is most _clear_ and _distinct_, for whatever I perceive _clearly_\nand _distinctly_ to be _real_, and _true_, and _perfect_, is wholy\n_contain\u2019d_ in this _Idea_ of _God_.\nNeither can it be objected, that I cannot _comprehend_ an _Infinite_, or\nthat there are innumerable other things in _God_, which I can neither\n_conceive_, nor in the least _think upon_; for it is of the _very\nnature_ of an _Infinite_ not to be _apprehendable_ by _me_ who am\n_finite_. And \u2019tis sufficient to me to prove this my _Idea_ of _God_ to\nbe the most _true_, the most _clear_, and the most _distinct Idea_ of all\nthose _Ideas_ I have, upon this _account_, that I understand that _God_\nis _not to be understood_, and that I judge that whatever I _clearly_\nperceive and know _Implys_ any _perfection_, as also perhaps other\ninnumerable _perfections_, which I am ignorant of, are in _God_ either\n_formally_ or _eminently_.\n_Doubt._ But perhaps _I am_ something _more_ then I take my self to\n_be_, and perhaps all these _perfections_ which I attribute to _God_,\nare _potentially_ in me, tho at present they do not shew themselves, and\nbreak into action. For I am now fully experienced that my _Knowledge_ may\nbe _encreased_, and I see nothing that hinders why it may not _encrease_\nby degrees in _Infinitum_, nor why by my _knowledge_ so _encreased_ I\nmay not attain to the other _perfections_ of _God_; nor lastly, why the\n_power_ or _aptitude_ of _having_ these perfections may not be sufficient\nto produce the _Idea_ of them in _me_.\n_Solution._ But none of these will do; for first, tho it be true that\nmy _Knowledge_ is capable of being _increased_, and that many things are\nin me _potentially_, which _actually_ are not, yet none of these go to\nthe making an _Idea_ of _God_, in which I conceive nothing _potentially_,\nfor tis a certain argument of _imperfection_ that a thing _may be\nencreased Gradually_. Moreover, tho my knowledge may be _more_ and _more\nencreased_, yet I know that it can never be _actually Infinite_, for it\ncan never arrive to that _height_ of _perfection_, which admits not of\nan _higher degree_. But I conceive God to be _actually_ so _Infinite_,\nthat nothing can be _added_ to his _perfections_. And lastly, I perceive\nthat the _objective being_ of an _Idea_ cannot be _produced_ only by the\n_potential being_ of a _thing_ (which in proper speech is _nothing_) but\nrequires an _actual_ or _formal being_ to its _production_.\nOf all which forementioned things there is nothing that is not _evident_\nby the _light_ of _reason_ to any one that will diligently consider them.\nYet because that (when I am careless, and the _Images_ of _sensible_\nthings _blind_ my _understanding_) I do not so easily call to mind the\nreasons, why the _Idea_ of a _being more perfect_ then _my self_ should\nof necessity proceed from a _being_ which is _really more perfect_; It\nwill be requisite to enquire further, whether _I_, who have this _Idea_,\ncan possibly _be_, unless _such_ a _being_ did _exist_. To which end\nlet me aske, _from whence_ should I _be_? From _my self_? or from my\n_Parents_? or from any other thing _less perfect_ then _God_? for nothing\ncan be thought or supposed _more perfect_, or _equally perfect_ with\n_God_.\nBut first, If _I_ were from my self, I should neither _doubt_, nor\n_desire_, nor _want_ any thing, for I should have given my self all those\n_perfections_, of which I have any _Idea_, and consequently I my self\nshould be _God_; and I cannot think that those things I _want_, are to\nbe acquired with _greater difficulty_ then those things I _have_; but on\nthe contrary, \u2019tis manifest, that it were much more _difficult_ that _I_\n(that is, _a substance_ that _thinks_) should _arise_ out of _nothing_,\nthen that I should _acquire_ the _knowledge_ of many things whereof I\nam _Ignorant_, which is only the _accident_ of that _substance_. And\ncertainly if I had that _greater thing_ (viz _being_) from my self, I\nshould not have _denyed_ my self (not only, those things which may be\neasier acquired, but also) All those things, which I perceived are\ncontain\u2019d in the _Idea_ of a _God_; and the reason is, for that no other\nthings _seem_ to me to be _more difficultly_ done, and certainly if they\nwere _Really more difficult_, they would _seem_ more _difficult_ to me\n(if whatever _I have_, I _have_ from my self) for in those things I\nshould find my _Power_ put to a stop.\nNeither can I Evade the force of these Arguments by supposing my self to\n_have alwaies Been, what now I am_, and that therefore I need not seek\nfor an _Author_ of my _Being_. For the _Duration_ or _Continuance_ of my\nlife may be _divided_ into _Innumerable Parts_, each of which does not\nat all _depend_ on the _Other Parts_; Therefore it will not follow, that\nbecause _a while ago, I was_, I must of necessity _now Be_. I say, this\nwill not follow, Unless, I suppose some _Cause_ to _Create me_ (as it\nwere) _anew_ for _this_ Moment (that is, _Conserve me_). For \u2019tis evident\nto one that Considers the Nature of _Duration_, that the same _Power_\nand _Action_ is requisite to the _Conservation_ of a Thing each _Moment_\nof its _Being_, as there is to the _Creation_ of that Thing _anew_, if\nit did _not exist_. So that \u2019tis one of those _Principles_ which are\n_Evident_ by the _Light_ of _Nature_: that the _Act_ of _Conservation_\ndiffers only _Ratione_ (as the Philosophers term it) from the _Act of\nCreation_.\nWherefore I ought to ask my self this Question, whether _I_, who _now_\nAm; have any _Power_ to _Cause_ my self to _Be hereafter_? (for had I any\nsuch _power_, I should certainly _know_ of it, seeing I am nothing but\na _Thinking Thing_, or at least at present I onely treat of that part\nof me, which is a _Thing_ that _Thinks_) to which, I answer, that I can\ndiscover no such _Power_ in Me; And consequently, I evidently know that\n_I depend_ on some _Other being distinct_ from _my self_.\nBut what if _I_ say that perhaps this _Being_ is not _God_, but that\n_I_ am produced either by my _Parents_, or some other _Causes less\nperfect_ then _God_? In answer to which let me consider (as _I_ have\nsaid before) that \u2019tis _manifest_ that whatever is in the _effect, so\nmuch_ at least ought to be in the _cause_; and therefore seeing _I_\nam a thing that _thinks_, and have in me an _Idea_ of _God_, it will\nconfessedly follow, that whatever sort of _cause_ I assign of my _own\nBeing_, it also must be a _Thinking Thing_, and must have an _Idea_ of\nall those _Perfections_, which I attribute to _God_; Of which _Cause_\nit may be again Asked, whether it be _from it self_, or from any other\n_Cause_? If _from it self_, \u2019tis evident (from what has been said) that\nit must be _God_; For seeing it has the _Power_ of _Existing of it self_,\nwithout doubt it has also the _power_ of _actually Possessing_ all those\n_Perfections_ whereof it has an _Idea_ in it self, that is, all those\n_Perfections_ which I conceive in _God_. But if it Be from an _other\nCause_, it may again be asked of that _Cause_ whether it be _of it self_,\nor from an _other_; Till at length We arrive at the _Last Cause_ of All,\nWhich will Be _God_. For \u2019tis evident, that this _Enquiry_ will not admit\nof _Progressus in Infinitum_, especially when at Present I treat not\nonly of that Cause which at _first made_ Me; But chiefly of that which\n_conserves_ me in this _Instant_ time.\nNeither can it be supposed that many _partial Causes_ have _concurred_\nto the making Me, and that I received the _Idea_ of one of _Gods\nperfections_ from _One_ of them, and from an _other_ of them the _Idea_\nof an _other_; and that therefore all these Perfections are to be\nfound _scattered_ in the World, but not all of them _Joyn\u2019d_ in any\none which may Be _God_. For on the contrary, _Unity_, _Simplicity_,\nor the _inseparability_ of All Gods Attributes is one of the _chief\nPerfections_ which I conceive in Him; and certainly the _Idea_ of the\n_Unity_ of the _Divine Perfections_ could not be _created_ in me by any\nother _cause_, then by _That_, from whence I have received the _Ideas_ of\nhis other _perfections_; For \u2019tis Impossible to make me conceive these\n_perfections_, _conjunct_ and _inseparable_, unless he should also make\nme know what _perfections_ these _are_.\nLastly as touching my _having_ my _Being_ from my _Parents_. Tho whatever\nThoughts I have heretofore harbour\u2019d of Them were _True_, yet certainly\nthey _contribute_ nothing to my _conservation_, neither proceed I from\nthem as _I am_ a _Thing_ that _Thinks_, for they have onely _predisposed_\nthat _material Thing_, wherein _I_, that is, _my mind_ (_which_ only\nat present I take for _my self_) _Inhabits_. Wherefore I cannot _now_\nQuestion that I am sprung from them. But I must of necessity conclude\nthat because _I am_, and because I have an _Idea_ of a _Being most\nperfect_, that is, of _God_, it evidently follows that _there is a God_.\n* Now it only remains for me to examine, how I have received this _Idea_\nof _God_. For I have neither received it by _means_ of _my Senses_,\nneither comes it to me _without_ my _Forethought_, as the _Ideas_ of\n_sensible_ things use to do, when such things _Work_ on the Organs of my\n_Sense_, or at least _seem_ so to work; Neither is this _Idea_ framed\nby _my self_, for I can neither _detract from_, nor _add_ any thing\n_thereto_. Wherefore I have only to conclude that it is _Innate_, even as\nthe _Idea_ of me _my self_ is _Natural_ to my self.\nAnd truly \u2019tis not to be Admired that _God_ in Creating me should\n_Imprint_ this _Idea_ in me, that it may there remain as a _stamp\nimpressed_ by the _Workman God_ on _me_ his _Work_, neither is it\nrequisite that this _stamp_ should be a Thing _different_ from the _Work_\nit self, but \u2019tis very Credible (from hence only that _God Created_ me)\nthat I am made as it were according to his _likeness_ and _Image_, and\nthat the same _likeness_, in which the _Idea_ of God is contain\u2019d, is\n_perceived_ by Me with the _same faculty_, with which I _perceive my\nSelf_; That is to say, whilst _I reflect_ upon my self, _I_ do not only\n_perceive_ that I am an _Imperfect_ thing, having my _dependance_ upon\nsome other thing, and that I am a Thing that Desires _more_ and _better_\nthings _Indefinitely_; But also at the same time I understand, that _He_\non whom I _depend_ contains in him all those _wish\u2019d for things_ (not\nonly _Indefinitely_ and _Potentially_, but) _Really_, _Indefinitely_;\nand that therefore he is _God_. The whole stress of which * Argument\nlies thus, because I know it Impossible for Me to Be of the same Nature\nI am, _Viz._ Having the _Idea_ of a _God_ in me, unless really there\nwere a _God_, a _God_ (I say) that very _same God_, whose _Idea I_ have\nin my _Mind_ (that is, Having all those _perfections_, which I cannot\n_comprehend_, but can as it were _think upon them_) and who is not\n_subject_ to any _Defects_.\nBy which \u2019tis evident that _God_ is no _Deceiver_; for \u2019tis manifest by\nthe _Light_ of _Nature_, that all _fraud_ and _deceit_ depends on some\n_defect_. But before I prosecute this any farther, or pry into other\n_Truthes_ which may be deduced from this, I am willing here to stop, and\ndwell upon the Contemplation of this _God_, to Consider with my self\nHis _Divine Attributes_, to behold, admire, and adore the Loveliness of\nthis _Immense light_, as much as possibly I am able to accomplish with my\n_dark_ Understanding. For as by _Faith_ we _believe_ that the greatest\n_happiness_ of the _next Life_ consists alone in the _Contemplation_ of\nthe _Divine Majesty_, so we _find_ by _Experience_ that now we receive\nfrom thence the greatest _pleasure_, whereof we are capable in _this\nLife_; Tho it be much more _Imperfect_ then that in the _Next_.\nMEDITAT. IV.\n_Of Truth and Falshood._\nOf late it has been so common with me to withdraw _my Mind_ from my\n_sences_, and I have so throughly consider\u2019d how few things there are\nappertaining to _Bodies_ that are _truly_ perceived, and that there are\nmore Things touching _Mans mind_, and yet more concerning _God_, which\nare _well known_; that now without any difficulty _I_ can turn my\nThoughts from things _sensible_, to those which are only _Intelligible_,\nand _Abstracted_ from _Matter_. And truely _I_ have a much more _distinct\nIdea_ of a _Mans mind_ (as it is a _Thinking Thing_, having no _Corporeal\nDimensions_ of _Length_, _Breadth_, and _Thickness_, nor having any other\n_Corporeal Quality_) then the _Idea_ of any _Corporeal Thing_ can be. And\nwhen I reflect upon my self, and consider how that I _doubt_, that is,\nam an _imperfect dependent Being_, I from hence Collect such a _clear_\nand _distinct Idea_ of an _Independent perfect Being_, which is _God_,\nand from hence only that _I have such an Idea_, that is, because _I_ that\nhave this _Idea_ do _my self Exist_; I do so _clearly_ conclude that\n_God also Exists_, and that on him my _Being depends_ each Minute; That\nI am Confident nothing can be known more _Evidently_ and _Certainly_ by\n_Humane Understanding_.\nAnd now _I_ seem to perceive a _Method_ by which, (from this\nContemplation of the _true God_, in whom the Treasures of _Knowledge_ and\n_Wisdome_ are Hidden) _I_ may attain the _Knowledge_ of other Things.\nAnd first, _I_ know \u2019tis impossible that this _God_ should _deceive_\nme; For in all _cheating_ and _deceipt_ there is something of\n_imperfection_; and tho to be _able_ to _deceive_ may seem to be an\nArgument of _ingenuity_ and _power_, yet without doubt to _have_ the\n_Will_ of _deceiving_ is a sign of _Malice_ and _Weakness_, and therefore\nis not _Incident_ to _God_.\nI have also found in my self a _Judicative faculty_, which certainly (as\nall other things I possess) I have received from _God_; and seeing he\nwill not _deceive_ me, he has surely given me such a _Judgement_, that\nI can _never Err_, whilst I make a _Right Use_ of it. Of which truth I\ncan make no doubt, unless it seems, that From hence it will follow, That\ntherefore _I can never Err_; for if whatever I have, I have from _God_,\nand if he gave me no _Faculty_ of _Erring_, I may seem not to be _able to\nErr_. And truly so it is whilst I think upon _God_, and wholly convert\nmy self to the _consideration_ of him, I find no occasion of _Error_ or\n_Deceit_; but yet when I return to the _Contemplation_ of _my self_, I\nfind my self liable to _Innumerable Errors_. Enquiring into the _cause_\nof which, I find in my self an _Idea_, not only a _real_ and _positive\none_ of a _God_, that is, of a _Being infinitely perfect_, but also\n(as I may so speak) a _Negative Idea_ of _Nothing_; that is to say, I\nam so constituted between God and Nothing or between a perfect _Being_\nand _No-being_, that as I am _Created_ by the _Highest Being_, I have\nnothing in Me by which I may be _deceived_ or drawn into _Error_; but as\nI pertake in a manner of _Nothing_, or of a _No-Being_, that is, as I my\nself am _not_ the _Highest Being_, and as I _want_ many _perfections_,\n\u2019tis no Wonder that I should be _Deceived_.\nBy which I understand that _Error_ * (as it is _Error_) is not any _real\nBeing_ dependant on _God_, but it is only a _Defect_; And that therefore\nto make me _Err_ there is not requisite a _faculty_ of _Erring_ given\nme by _God_, but only it so happens that I _Err_ meerly because the\n_Judicative faculty_, which he has given me, is not _Infinite_.\nBut yet this Account is not fully _satisfactory_; for _Error_ is not\nonly a meer _Negation_, but \u2019tis a _Privation_, or a _want_ of a certain\n_Knowledge_, which _ought_ (as it were) to be in me. And when I consider\nthe _Nature_ of _God_, it seems impossible that he should give me any\n_faculty_ which is not _perfect_ in its _kind_, or which should _want_\nany of its _due perfections_; for if by how much the more _skilful_ the\n_Workman_ is, by so much the _Perfecter Works_ proceed from him. What can\nbe made by the _Great Maker_ of all things which is not _fully perfect_?\nFor I cannot Doubt but _God_ may _Create_ me so that I may _never_ be\n_deceived_, neither can I doubt but that he _Wills_ whatever is _Best_;\nIs it therefore _better_ for me to be _deceived_, or not to be _deceived?_\nThese things when I Consider more heedfully, it comes into my Mind,\nFirst, that \u2019tis no cause of Admiration that _God_ should do Things\nwhereof I can give no account, nor must I therefore doubt his _Being_,\nbecause there are many things done by him, and I not comprehend _Why_\nor _How_ they are done; for seeing I now know that my _Nature_ is very\n_Weak_ and _Finite_, and that the _Nature_ of _God_ is _Immense_,\n_Incomprehensible_, _Infinite_; from hence I must fully, understand, that\nhe can do numberless things, the _Causes_ whereof lie _hidden_ to Me.\nUpon which account only I esteem all those Causes which are Drawn from\nthe End (viz. _Final Causes_) as of no use in _Natural Philosophy_, for I\ncannot without Rashness Think my self _able_ to Discover _Gods_ Designes.\nI perceive this also, that whenever we endeavour to know whether the\n_Works_ of _God_ are _perfect_, we must not Respect any _one kind_ of\nCreature _singly_, but the _Whole Universe_ of _Beings_; for perhaps what\n(if considered _alone_) may Deservedly seem _Imperfect_, yet (as it is a\n_part_ of the _World_) is most _perfect_; and tho since I have _doubted_\nof all things, I have discover\u2019d nothing _certainly_ to _Exist_, but _my\nself_, and _God_, yet since I have Consider\u2019d the _Omnipotency_ of _God_,\nI cannot deny, but that many other things _are made_ (or at least, _may\nbe made_) by him, so that I my self _may be_ a _part_ of this _Universe_.\nFurthermore, coming nigher to my self, and enquiring what these _Errors_\nof mine, are (which are the Only Arguments of my _Imperfection_) * I\nfind them to _depend_ on _two concurring Causes_, on my _faculty_ of\n_Knowing_, and on my _faculty_ of _Choosing_ or _Freedome_ of my _Will_,\nthat is to say, from my _Understanding_, and my _Will together_. For\nby my _Understanding alone_ I only perceive _Ideas_, whereon I make\n_Judgments_, wherein (_precisely_ so taken) there can be no _Error,\nproperly_ so called; for tho perhaps there may be numberless things,\nwhose _Ideas_ I have _not_ in Me, yet I am not _properly_ to be said\n_Deprived_ of them, but only _negatively wanting_ them; and I cannot\nprove that _God ought_ to have given me a _greater faculty_ of _Knowing_.\nAnd tho I understand him to be a _skilful Workman_, yet I cannot Think,\nthat he _ought_ to have put all those _perfections_ in _each_ Work of his\n_singly_, with which he might have _endowed some_ of them.\nNeither can I complain that _God_ has not given me a _Will_, or _Freedom_\nof _Choise_, _large_ and _perfect_ enough; for I have experienced that\n\u2019tis _Circumscribed_ by _no Bounds_.\nAnd \u2019tis worth our taking notice, that I have no other thing in me so\n_perfect_ and so _Great_, but I Understand that there may be _Perfecter_\nand _Greater_, for if (for Example) I consider the _Faculty_ of\n_Understanding_, I presently perceive that in me \u2019tis very _small_ and\n_Finite_, and also at the same time I form to my self an _Idea_ of an\nother _Understanding_ not only _much Greater_, but the _Greatest_ and\n_Infinite_, which I perceive to belong to _God_. In the same manner if I\nenquire into _memory_ or _imagination_ or any other faculties, I find\nthem in my self _Weak_ and _Circumscribed_, but in _God_ I Understand\nthem to be _Infinite_, there is therefore only my _Will_ or _Freedome_\nof _Choice_, which I find to be _so Great_, that I cannot frame to my\nself an _Idea_ of _One Greater_, so that \u2019tis by this _chiefly_ by which\nI Understand my self to Bear the _likeness_ and _Image_ of _God_. For\ntho the _Will_ in _God_ be without comparison _Greater_ then Mine, both\nas to the _Knowledge_ and _Power_ which are _Joyn\u2019d_ therewith, which\nmake it more _strong_ and _Effective_, and also as to the _Object_\nthereof, for _God_ can apply himself to _more_ things then I can. Yet\nbeing taken _Formally_ and _Precisely Gods Will_ seems _no greater_ then\nMine. For the _Freedome_ of _Will_ consists only in this, that we can\n_Do_, or _not Do_ such a Thing (that is, _affirm_ or _deny_, _prosecute_\nor _avoid_) or rather in this Only, that we are _so carried_ to a Thing\nwhich is _proposed_ by Our _Intellect_ to _Affirm_ or _Deny_, _Prosecute_\nor _Shun_, that we are _sensible_, that we are _not Determin\u2019d_ to the\n_Choice_ or _Aversion_ thereof, by any _outward Force_.\nNeither is it Requisite to make one _Free_ that he should have an\n_Inclination_ to _both_ sides. For on the contrary, by how much the more\n_strongly_ I am inclined to _one_ side (whether it be that I _evidently\nperceive_ therein Good or Evil, or Whether it be that _God has so\ndisposed_ my _Inward Thoughts_) By so much the _more Free_ am I in my\n_Choice_.\nNeither truly do _Gods Grace_ or _Natural Knowledge_ take away from\nmy _Liberty_, but rather _encrease_ and _strengthen_ it. For that\n_indifference_ which I find in my self, when no Reason inclines me _more_\nto _one side_, then to _the other_, is the _meanest_ sort of _Liberty_,\nand is so far from being a sign of _perfection_, that it only argues a\n_defect_ or _negation_ of _Knowledge_; for if I should always _Clearly\nsee_ what were _True_ and _Good_ I should never _deliberate_ in my\n_Judgement_ or _Choice_, and Consequently, tho I were _perfectly Free_,\nyet I should never be _Indifferent_.\nFrom all which, I perceive that neither the _Power_ of _Willing\nprecisely_ so taken, which I have from _God_, is the _Cause_ of my\n_Errors_, it being most _full_ and _perfect_ in its kind; Neither also\nthe _Power_ of _Understanding_, for whatever I _Understand_ (since \u2019tis\nfrom God that I _Understand_ it) I _understand aright_, nor can I be\ntherein _Deceived_.\nFrom _Whence_ therefore proceed all my _Errors_? To which, I answer,\nthat they proceed from _hence_ only, that seeing the _Will_ expatiates\nit self _farther_ then the _Understanding_, I keep it not within the\n_same bounds_ with my _Understanding_, but often extend it to those\nthings which I _Understand not_, to which things it being _Indifferent_,\nit easily Declines from what is _True_ and _Good_; and consequently\nI am _Deceived_ and _Commit sin_. * Thus, for example, when lately I\nfelt my self to enquire, Whether any thing doth _Exist_, and found\nthat from my setting _my self_ to Examine such a thing, it evidently\nfollows that I _my self Exist_, I could not but _Judge_, what I so\n_clearly Understood_, to be _true_, not that I was _forced_ thereto by\nany _outward impulse_, but because a _strong Propension_ in my _Will_\ndid follow this _Great Light_ in my _Understanding_, so that I believed\nit so much the more _freely_ and _willingly_, by how much the less\n_indifferent_ I was thereto. But now I understand, not only, that I\n_Exist_ as I am a _Thing_ that _Thinks_, but I also meet with a certain\n_Idea_ of a _Corporeal Nature_, and it so happens that I _doubt_,\nwhether that _Thinking Nature_ that is in me be _Different_ from that\n_Corporeal Nature_, or Whether they are _both the same_: but in this\n_I_ suppose that _I_ have found no Argument to _incline_ me _either\nways_, and therefore _I_ am _Indifferent_ to _affirm_ or _deny either_,\nor to _Judge nothing_ of _either_; But this _indifferency_ extends it\nself not only to those things of which I am _clearly ignorant_, but\ngenerally to all those things which are _not_ so very _evidently known_\nto me at the Time when my _Will Deliberates_ of them; for tho never so\nprobable _Guesses incline_ me to _one_ side, yet the Knowing that they\nare only _Conjectures_, and not indubitable _reasons_, is enough to Draw\nmy _Assent_ to the _Contrary_ Part. Which Lately _I_ have sufficiently\nexperienced, when _I_ supposed all those things (which formerly _I_\nassented to as most _True_) as very _False_, for this _Reason_ only that\n_I_ found my self _able_ to doubt of them in some manner.\nIf I abstain from _passing_ my _Judgment_, when I do _not clearly_ and\n_distinctly_ enough perceive what is _Truth_, \u2019tis evident that I do\n_well_, and that I am _not deceived_: But if I _affirm_ or _deny_, then\n\u2019tis that I _abuse_ the _freedome_ of my _will_, and if I turn my self\nto that part which is _false_, I am _deceived_; but if I _embrace_ the\n_contrary_ Part, \u2019tis but _by chance_ that I light on the _Truth_, yet\nI shall not therefore be Blameless, for \u2019tis Manifest by the _light_\nof _Nature_ that the _Perception_ of the _Understanding ought_ to\npreceed the _Determination_ of the _Will_. And \u2019tis in this _abuse_ of\n_Free-Will_ that That _Privation_ consists, which Constitutes _Error_;\nI say there is a _Privation_ in the _Action_ as it proceeds from Me,\nbut not in the _Faculty_ which I have received from _God_; nor in the\n_Action_ as it _depends_ on _him_.\nNeither have I any Reason to Complain that God has not given me a _larger\nIntellective Faculty_, or more _Natural Light_, for \u2019tis a necessary\nIncident to a _finite Understanding_ that it should not Understand _All_\nthings, and \u2019tis Incident to a _Created Understanding_ to be _Finite_:\nand I have more Reason to thank him for what he has _bestowed_ upon me\n(tho he _owed_ me nothing) then to think my self _Robbed_ by him of those\nthings which he _never gave me_.\nNor have I Reason to Complain that he has given me a _Will_ larger then\nmy _Understanding_: for seeing the _Will_ Consists in _one_ thing only,\nand as it were in an _Indivisible_ (viz. to _Will_, or _not to Will_) it\nseems contrary to its nature that it should be _less_ then \u2019tis; and\ncertainly by how much the _Greater_ it is, so much the more _Thankful_ I\nought to be to _him_; that Gave it me.\nNeither can I Complain that God _concurrs_ with me in the Production of\nthose _Voluntary Actions_ or _Judgements_ in which I am _deceived_: for\nthose _Acts_ as they _depend_ on _God_ are altogether _True_ and _Good_;\nand I am in some measure _more perfect_ in that I can _so Act_, then if\nI could _not_: for that _Privation_, in which the _Ratio Formalis_ of\n_Falshood_ and _Sin_ consists, wants not the _Concourse_ of _God_; For\nit is _not A Thing_, and having respect to him as its _Cause_, ought\nnot to be called _Privation_, but _Negation_; for certainly \u2019tis no\n_Imperfection_ in _God_, that he has given me a _freedome_ of _Assenting_\nor _not Assenting_ to some things, the _clear_ and _distinct_ Knowledge\nwhereof he has not _Imparted_ to my _Understanding_; but certainly \u2019tis\nan _Imperfection_ in me, that I _abuse_ this _liberty_, and _pass_ my\n_Judgement_ on those things which I do _not Rightly_ Understand.\nYet I see that \u2019tis Possible with _God_ to effect that (tho I should\nremain _Free_, and of a _Finite Knowledge_) I should _never Err_, that\nis, if he had endowed my _Understanding_ with a _clear_ and _distinct_\nKnowledge of all things whereof I should ever have an _Occasion_ of\n_deliberating_; or if he had only so firmly fix\u2019d in my Mind, that I\nshould never forget, this, _That I must never Judge of a thing which I\ndo not clearly and distinctly Understand_; Either of which things had\n_God_ done, I easily perceive that _I_ (as consider\u2019d in my self) should\nbe _more perfect_ then now I am, yet nevertheless I cannot deny but that\nthere _may be a greater perfection_ in the _whole Universe_ of Things,\nfor that some of its parts are Obnoxious to _Errors_, and some not, then\nif they were all _alike_. And I have no Reason to Complain, that it has\npleased God, that I should _Act_ on the _Stage_ of this _World_ a _Part_\nnot the _chief_ and _most perfect_ of all; Or that I should not be able\nto abstain from _Error_ in the _first way_ above specifi\u2019d, which depends\nupon the _Evident Knowledge_ of those things whereof _I deliberate_; Yet\nthat I may abstain from _Error_ by the _other means_ abovemention\u2019d,\nwhich depends only on this, _That I Judge not of any Thing, the truth\nwhereof is not Evident._ For tho I have experienced in my self this\n_Infirmity_, that I cannot _always_ be intent upon _one_ and the _same_\nKnowledge, yet _I_ may by a _continued_ and _often repeated_ Meditation\nbring this to pass, that as often as _I_ have use of this Rule _I_ may\nRemember it, by which means I may Get (as it were) an _habit_ of _not\nerring_.\nIn which thing seeing, the _greatest_ and _chief perfection_ of\n_Man_ consists, _I_ repute my self to have gain\u2019d much by this days\n_Meditation_, for that therein _I_ have discover\u2019d the _Cause_ of\n_Error_, _and Falshood_; which certainly can be no other then what _I_\nhave now Declared; for whenever in Passing my Judgement, _I_ bridle\nmy _Will_ so that it extend it self _only_ to those things which I\n_clearly_ and _distinctly_ perceive, it is impossible that I can _Err_.\nFor doubtless All _clear_ and _distinct_ Perception is _something_, and\ntherefore cannot _proceed_ from _Nothing_, but must necessarily have\n_God_ for its _Author_ (_God_, I say, Who is _infinitely Perfect_, and\nwho _cannot Deceive_) and therefore it Must be _True_.\nNor have I this Day learnt only what I must _beware off_ that I be not\n_deceived_, but also what I must _Do_ to Discover _Truth_, for _That_ I\nshall certainly find, if I fully Apply my self to those things _only_,\nwhich I _perfectly_ understand; and if I distinguish between those and\nwhat I apprehend but _confusedly_ and _obscurely_; Both which hereafter I\nshall endeavour.\nMEDITAT. V.\n_~Of the Essence~ of Things ~Material~. And herein Again of ~God~. And\nthat he does ~Exist~._\nThere are yet remaining many Things concerning _Gods Attributes_, and\nmany things concerning the _nature_ of _my self_ or of my _Mind_, which\nought to be searched into: but these perhaps I shall set upon at some\nother Opportunity. And at Present nothing seems to me more requisite\n(feeling I have discover\u2019d what I must _avoid_, and what I must _Do_ for\nthe _Attaining_ of _Truth_) then that I imploy my Endeavours to free my\nself from those doubts into which I have lately fallen, and that I try\nwhether I can have any certainty of Material Things.\nBut before I enquire whether there be any such things _Really Existent\nwithout_ Me, I ought to consider the _Ideas_ of those things, as they are\nin my Thoughts and try which of them are _Distinct_, which _confused_.\nIn which search I find that I _distinctly imagine Quantity_, that which\nPhilosophers commonly call _continued_, that is to say, the _Extension_\nof that _Quantity_ or thing _continued_ into _Length_, _Breadth_, and\n_Thickness_, I can _count_ in it divers Parts, to which parts I can\nassign _Bigness_, _Figure_, _Position_, and _Local Motion_, to which\n_Local Motion_ I can assign _Duration_. Neither are only these _Generals_\nplainly discover\u2019d and known by Me, but also by attentive Consideration,\nI perceive Innumerable _particulars_ concerning the _Shapes_, _Number_,\nand _Motion_ of These Bodies; The _Truth_ whereof is so _evident_, and\n_agreeable_ to my _Nature_, that when I first discover\u2019d them, I seemed\nnot so much to have _Learnt_ any thing that is _new_, as to have only\n_remembred_ what I have known _before_, or only to have thought on those\nthings which were in me _before_, tho this be the first time that I have\nexamin\u2019d them so _diligently_.\nOne thing there is worthy my Consideration, which is, that I find in my\nself innumerable _Ideas_ of certain things, which tho perhaps they _exist\nno where without_ Me, yet they cannot Be said to be _Nothing_; and tho\nthey are _Thought_ upon by me at my _will_ and _pleasure_, yet they are\nnot _made_ by _Me_, but have their own _True_ and _Immutable Natures_.\nAs when, for example, * I _Imagine_ a _Triangle_, tho perhaps such a\n_Figure Exists no where_ out of my _Thoughts_, nor ever _will Exist_,\nyet the _Nature_ thereof is _determinate_, and its _Essence_ or Form is\n_Immutable_ and _Eternal_, which is neither _made_ by me, nor _depends_\non my mind, as appears for that many _properties_ may be _demonstrated_\nof this Triangle, _viz._ That its three Angles are equal to two right\nones, that to its Greatest Angle the Greatest side is subtended, and such\nlike, which I now _clearly_ know whether _I will or not_, tho before _I_\nnever thought on them, when I _imagine_ a Triangle, and consequently they\ncould not be invented by Me. And \u2019tis nothing to the purpose for me to\nsay, that perhaps this _Idea_ of a Triangle came to me by the Organs of\n_sense_, because I have sometimes seen bodies of a _Triangular Shape_;\nfor I can think of Innumerable other _Figures_, which I cannot suspect\nto have come in through my _senses_, and yet I can _Demonstrate_ various\n_properties_ of them, as well as of a _Triangle_, which certainly are all\n_true_, seeing I know them _clearly_, and therefore they are _something_,\nand not a meer _Nothing_, for \u2019tis Evident that _what is true is\nsomething_.\nAnd now I have sufficiently Demonstrated, that _what I clearly perceive,\nis True_; And tho I had _not demonstrated_ it, yet such is the _Nature_\nof my _Mind_, that I could not but give my _Assent_ to what I _so_\nperceive, at least, as long as I _so_ perceive it; and I remember\n(heretofore when I most of all relied on _sensible Objects_) that I held\nthose _Truths_ for the most _certain_ which I _evidently_ perceived,\nsuch as are concerning _Figures_, _Numbers_, with other parts of\n_Arithmetick_, and _Geometry_, as also whatever relates to _pure_ and\n_abstracted Mathematicks_.\nNow therefore, if from this alone, _That I can frame the Idea of a Thing\nin my Mind_, it follows, _That whatever I clearly and distinctly perceive\nbelonging to a thing_, does _Really belong to it_; Cannot I from hence\ndraw an Argument to Prove the _Existence_ of a _God_? Certainly I find\nthe _Idea_ of a _God_, or _infinitely perfect Being_, as _naturally_ in\nme, as the _Idea_ of any _Figure_, or _Number_; and I as _clearly_ and\n_distinctly_ understand that it appertains to his _Nature Always to Be_,\nas I know that what I can _demonstrate_ of a _Mathematical Figure_ or\n_Number_ belongs to the _Nature_ of that _Figure_ or _Number_: so that,\ntho all things which I have _Meditated_ upon these three or four days\nwere not _true_, yet I may well be as _certain_ of the _Existence_ of a\n_God_, as I have hitherto been of _Mathematical Truths_.\n_Doubt._ Yet this Argument at first sight appears not so _evident_, but\nlooks rather like a _sophism_; for seeing I am used in all other things\nto _Distinguish Existence_ from _Essence_, I can easily perswade my self\nthat the _Existence_ of _God_ may be _distinguish\u2019d_ from his _Essence_,\nso that I may _Imagine God_ not to _Exist_.\n_Solution._ But considering it more strictly, \u2019tis manifest, that the\n_Existence_ of _God_ can no more be _seperated_ from his _Essence_,\nthen the _Equality_ of the _Three Angles_ to _two right ones_ can be\n_seperated_ from the _Essence_ of a _Triangle_, or then the _Idea_ of a\n_Mountain_ can be _without_ the _Idea_ of a _valley_; so that \u2019tis no\nless a _Repugnancy_ to think of a _God_ (that is, _A Being infinitely\nperfect_) who wants _Existence_ (that is, who wants a _Perfection_) then\nto think of a _Mountain_, to which there is _no Valley adjoyning_.\n_Doubt._ But what if I cannot imagine _God_ but as _Existing_, or a\n_Mountain without a Vally_? yet supposing me to think of a _Mountain with\na Vally_, it does not from thence follow, that there _Is a Mountain_\nin the World; so supposing me to think of a _God_ as _Existing_, yet\ndoes it not follow that _God Really Exists_. For my _Thought imposes_\nno _necessity_ on Things, and as I may imagine a _Winged Horse_, tho no\n_Horse_ has _Wings_, so I may imagine an _existing God_, tho no _God\nexist_.\n_Solution._ \u2019Tis true the _Sophism_ seems to lie in this, yet tho I\ncannot conceive a _Mountain_ but with a _Vally_, it does not from hence\nfollow, that a _Mountain_ or _Vally_ do _Exist_, but this will follow,\nthat whether a _Mountain_ or a _Vally do_ or _do not Exist_, yet they\ncannot be _seperated_: so from hence that I cannot think of _God_ but\nas _Existing_, it follows that _Existence_ is _Inseperable_ from _God_,\nand therefore that he _Really Exists_; Not because my _Thought_ does\nall this, or _Imposes_ any _necessity_ on any Thing, but contrarily,\nbecause the _necessity_ of the thing it self (_viz._ of _Gods Existence_)\n_Determines_ me to _think_ thus; for \u2019tis not in my Power to think a\n_God_ without _Existence_ (that is, _A Being absolutely perfect_ without\nthe _Cheif Perfection_) as it is in my Power to imagine a Horse either\n_with_ or _without Wings_.\n_Doubt._ And here it cannot be said, that I am forced to suppose _God\nExisting_, after I have supposed him _endowed_ with all _Perfections_,\nseeing _Existence_ is one of them; but that my _First Position_ (_viz._\nHis _Absolute Perfection_) is not _necessary_. Thus, for example, \u2019tis\nnot _necessary_ for me to think all _Quadrilateral Figures_ inscribed in\na _Circle_; But supposing that I think _so_, I am then _necessitated_ to\nConfess a _Rhombe Inscribed_ therein, and yet this is evidently _False_.\n_Solution._ For tho I am not forced at any time to think of a _God_; yet\nas often as I cast my Thoughts on a _First_ and _Cheif Being_, and as\nit were bring forth out of the Treasury of my Mind an _Idea_ thereof,\nI must of necessity attribute thereto all Manner of _Perfections_, tho\nI do not at that time _count_ them over, or _Remark_ each single One;\nwhich _necessity_ is sufficient to make me hereafter (when I come to\nconsider _Existence_ to be a _Perfection_) conclude _Rightly, That the\nFirst and Chief Being does Exist_. Thus, for example, I am not obliged at\nany time to imagine a _Triangle_, yet whenever I please to Consider of a\n_Right-lined Figure_ having only _three Angles_, I am then _necessitated_\nto allow it all those _Requisites_ from which I may argue rightly, _That\nthe Three Angles thereof are not Greater then Two Right Ones_, Tho\nupon the first consideration this came not into my Thought. But when I\nenquire what Figures may be _inscribed_ within a _Circle_, I am not at\nall _necessitated_ to think that all _Quadrilateral Figures_ are of that\nsort; neither can I possibly imagine this, whilst I admit of nothing,\nbut what I _clearly_ and _distinctly_ Understand: and therefore there\nis a great Difference between these _False suppositions_, and _True\nnatural Ideas_, the _first_ and _Chief_; whereof is that of a _God_;\nFor by many wayes I understand _That_ not to be a _Fiction depending_\non my _Thought_, but an _Image_ of a _True_ and _Immutable Nature_;\nAs first, because I can think of no other thing but _God_ to Whose\n_Essence Existence_ belongs. Next because I cannot Imagine _Two_ or _More\nGods_, and supposing that he is _now_ only One, I may plainly perceive\nit _necessary_ for _Him_ to _Have been from Eternity_, and _will Be to\nEternity_; And Lastly because I perceive many Other Things in _God_,\nWhich I cannot _Change_, and from which I cannot _Detract_.\nBut whatever way of Argumentation I use, it comes All at last to this one\nThing, That I am fully perswaded of the _Truth_ of those things only,\nwhich appear to me _clearly_ and _distinctly_. And tho some of those\nthings, which I so perceive, are obvious to _every_ Man, and some are\nonly discover\u2019d by Those that search more _nighly_, and enquire more\n_carefully_, yet when such _truths_ are discover\u2019d, they are esteem\u2019d\nno less _certain_ than the Others. For Example, Tho it do not so easily\nappear, that in a Rightangled Triangle, the square of the Base is equal\nto the squares of the sides, as it appears, that the Base is suspended\nunder its Largest Angle, yet the _first Proposition_ is _no less\ncertainly_ believed when once \u2019tis perceived, then this _Last_.\nThus in Reference to _God_; certainly, unless I am overrun with\n_Prejudice_, or have my thoughts begirt on all sides with _sensible\nObjects_, I should acknowledge nothing _before_ or _easier_ then him;\nFor what is more _self-evident_ then that there is a _Chief Being_, or\nthen that a _God_ (to whose _essence alone Existence_ appertains) does\n_Exist_? And tho serious Consideration is required to perceive thus\nmuch, yet _Now_, I am not only equally _certain_ of it, as of what seems\nmost _certain_, but I perceive also that the _Truth_ of other Things so\n_depends_ on it, that without it nothing can ever be _perfectly known_.\nFor tho my _nature_ be _such_, that during the time of my _Clear_ and\n_Distinct_ Perception, I cannot but believe it _true_; yet my _Nature_\nis _such_ also, that I cannot fix the _Intention_ of my _Mind_ upon one\nand the same thing alwayes, so as to perceive it _clearly_, and the\nRemembrance of what _Judgement_ I have formerly made is often stirred\nup, when I cease attending to those reasons for which I passed such a\nJudgment, other Reasons may then be produced, which (if I did not _know\nGod_) may easily _move_ me in my _Opinion_; and by this means I shall\nnever attain to the _true_ and _certain Knowledge_ of any Thing, but\n_Wandring_ and _Unstable opinions_. So, for example, when I consider the\nNature of a Triangle, it plainly appears to me (as understanding the\nPrinciples of Geometry) that its three Angles are equal to two right\nones; And this I must of necessity think _True_ as long as I attend to\nthe _Demonstration_ thereof; but as soon as ever I withdraw my Mind from\nthe _Consideration_ of its _Proof_ (altho I remember that I have once\n_Clearly_ perceived it) yet perhaps I may _doubt_ of Its _Truth_, being\nas yet _Ignorant_ of a _God_; For I may perswade my self, that I am so\nframed by _Nature_, as to be _deceived_ in those things which I imagine\nmy self to perceive most _evidently_, Especially when I recollect, that\nheretofore I have often accounted many things _True_ and _Certain_, which\nafterward upon other Reasons I have Judged as False. But when I perceive\nthat there is a _God_; because at the same time I also Understand\nthat all things _Depend_ on Him, and that he is not a _Deceiver_; and\nwhen from hence I Collect that all those Things which I _clearly_ and\n_distinctly_ perceive are _necessarily True_; tho I have no further\nRespects to those Reasons which induced me to believe it _True_, yet if\nI do but remember, that I have _once clearly_ and _distinctly_ perceived\nit, no Argument can be brought on the contrary, that shall make me\n_doubt_, but that I have _true_ and _certain_ Knowledge thereof; and not\nonely of that, but of all other _Truths_ also which I remember that I\nhave _once Demonstrated_, such as are _Geometrical Propositions_ and the\nlike.\nWhat now can be _Objected_ against me? shall I say, that I am so made by\n_Nature_, as to be often _deceived_? No; For I now Know that I cannot be\n_deceived_ in those Things, which I _clearly_ Understand. Shall I say,\nthat at other times I have esteem\u2019d many Things _True_ and _Certain_,\nwhich afterwards I found to be _falsities_? No; for I perceived none\nof those things _clearly_ and _distinctly_, but being Ignorant of this\n_Rule_ of _Truth_, I took them up for Reasons, which Reasons I afterward\nfound to be _Weak_. What then can be said? Shall, I say, (as lately I\nobjected) that Perhaps I am _asleep_, and that what I now think of is\nno more _True_, then the _Dreams_ of People _asleep_? But this it self\n_moves_ not my Opinion; for certainly tho I were _asleep_, if any thing\nappear\u2019d _evident_ to my Understanding, \u2019twould be _True_.\nAnd Thus I Plainly see, that the _Certainty_ and _Truth_ of all _Science_\nDepends on the _Knowledge_ of the _True God_, so that before I had _Known\nHim_, I did _Know nothing_; But now many things both of _God_ himself,\nand of other _Intellectual Things_, as also of _Corporeal nature_, which\nis the _Object_ of _Mathematicks_, may be _Plainly Known_ and _Certain_\nto me.\nMEDITAT. VI.\n_~Of Corporeal Beings~, and Their ~Existence~: As Also of the Real\nDifference, Between ~Mind~ and ~Body~._\nIt now remains that I examine whether any _Corporeal Beings_ do _Exist_;\nAnd already I know that (as they are the _Object_ of _Pure Mathematicks_)\nthey _May_ (at least) _Exist_, for I _clearly_ and _distinctly_ perceive\nthem; and doubtless _God_ is _able_ to _make_, whatever I am _able_ to\n_perceive_, and I never Judged any thing to be _beyond_ his _Power_, but\nwhat was _Repugnant_ to a _distinct perception_. Moreover, such _Material\nBeings seem_ to _Exist_ from the _faculty_ of _Imagination_, which I\nfind my self make use of, when I am conversant about them: for if I\nattentively Consider what _Imagination_ is, \u2019twill appear to be only _a\ncertain Application of our Cognoscitive or knowing Faculty to a Body or\nObject that is before it_; and if it be _before it_, It must _Exist_.\nBut that this may be made more _Plain_, I must first examine the\n_difference_ between _Imagination_, and _pure Intellection_, or\n_Understanding_. So, for example, when I _Imagine_ a Triangle, I do not\nonly _Understand_ that it is a _figure comprehended_ by _three Lines_,\nbut I also _behold_ with the _eye_ of my _mind_ those _three lines_ as\nit were _before Me_, and this is that which I call _imagination_. But\nif I convert my Thoughts to a _Chiliogone_, or _Figure consisting_ of a\n_Thousand Angles_, I know as well that this Is a _figure comprehended_ by\na _Thousand sides_, as I know that a _Triangle_ is a _Figure Consisting_\nof _three sides_; but I do not in the same Manner _Imagine_, or _behold_\nas _present_ those _thousand sides_, as I do the _three sides_ of a\n_Triangle_. And tho at the time when I so think of a _Chiliogone_, I may\n_confusedly_ represent to my self some _Figure_ (because whenever I Think\nof a _Corporeal Object_, I am used to _Imagine_ some _Shape_ or other)\nyet \u2019tis evident that this _Representation_ is not a _Chiliogone_,\nbecause \u2019tis in nothing _different_ from what I should Represent to my\nself if I thought of a _Milion-angled figure_, or any other Figure of\n_More sides_; Neither does such a _Confused Representation_ help me in\nthe least to know those _Properties_, by which a _Chiliogone_ differs\nfrom other _Polygones_ or _Manyangled Figures_. But if a Question be\nput concerning a _Pentagone_, I know I may _Understand its Shape_, as\nI _Understand_ the _Shape_, of a _Chiliogone_, without the help of\n_Imagination_, but I can also _imagine_ it, by applying the _Eye_ of my\n_Mind_ to its _Five sides_, and to the _Area_ or _space_ contained by\nThem; And herein I manifestly perceive that there is required a _peculiar\nsort_ of _Operation_ in the _Mind_ to _imagine_ a Thing, which I require\nnot to _Understand_ a Thing; which _New Operation_ of the _Mind_ plainly\nshews the _difference_ between _imagination_ and _pure Intellection_.\nBesides this, I Consider that this _Power_ of _Imagination_ which is in\nme (as it differs from the _Power_ of _Understanding_) does not appertain\nto the _Essence_ of _Me_, that is, of _my mind_, for tho I _wanted_ it,\nyet certainly I should be the _same He, that_ now _I am_: from whence it\nseems to follow, that it depends on something _different_ from _my self_;\nand I easily perceive that if any _Body_ whatever did _Exist_, to which\nmy _Mind_ were so _conjoyn\u2019d_, that it may Apply it self when it pleased\nto _Consider_, or (as it were) _Look_ into _this Body_; From hence, I\nsay, I perceive _It may so be_, that by this very _Body_ I may _Imagine\nCorporeal Beings_: So that this _Manner_ of _Thinking_ differs from _pure\nIntellection_ only in this, that the _Mind_, when it _Understands_, does\nas it were turn _it self_, to _it self_, or _Reflect_ on it self, and\n_beholds_ some or other of those _Ideas_ which are in it self; But when\nit _Imagines_, it _Converts_ it self upon _Body_, and therein _beholds_\nsomething Conformable to that _Idea_, which it hath _understood_, or\n_perceived_ by _Sense_.\nBut \u2019tis to be remembred, that I said, I easily conceive Imagination\n_May be_ so performed, supposing _Body_ to _Exist_. And because no\nso convenient manner of Explaining it offers it self, from thence\nI _probably_ guess, that _Body_ does _Exist_. But this I only say\n_probably_, for tho I should accurately search into all the Arguments\ndrawn from the _distinct Idea_ of _Body_, which I find in my\n_Imagination_, yet I find none of them, from whence I may _necessarily_\nconclude, _that Body does Exist_.\nBut I have been accustomed to _Imagine_ many other things besides that\n_Corporeal Nature_ which is the _Object_ of _pure Mathematicks_; such\nas are, _Colours_, _Sounds_, _Tasts_, _Pain_, &c. but none of these so\n_distinctly_. And because I perceive these better by _Sense_, from Which\nby the Help of the _Memory_ they come to the _Imagination_, that I may\nwith the Greater advantage treat of them, I ought at the same time to\nConsider _Sence_, and to try whether from what I perceive by that way of\n_Thought_, which I call _Sense_, I can deduce any certain Argument for\nthe _Existence_ of _Corporeal Beings_.\nAnd first I will here reflect with my self, what those things were,\nwhich being perceived by _Sence_ I have heretofore thought _True_, and\nthe _Reasons_ why I _so thought_: I will then enquire into the _Reasons_\nfor which I afterwards _doubted_ those things. And last of all I will\nconsider what I _ought_ to _think_ of those Things at _Present_.\n[Sidenote: _The Reasons why I Trusted my Senses._]\nFirst therefore I have always thought that I have had an _Head_,\n_Hands_, _Feet_, and other _Members_, of which _This Body_ (which I have\nlook\u2019d upon as a _Part_ of _Me_, or Perhaps as my _Whole self_) Consists;\nAnd I have also thought that this _Body_ of _Mine_ is Conversant or\nengaged among many _Other Bodies_, by which it is Liable to be _affected_\nwith what is _advantagious_ or _hurtful_; What was _Advantagious_\nI judged by a certain _sense_ of _Pleasure_, what was _Hurtful_ by\na _sense_ of _Pain_. Furthermore, besides _Pleasure_ and _Pain_, I\nperceived in my self _Hunger_, _Thirst_, and other such like _Appetites_,\nas also certain _Corporeal Propensions_ to _Mirth_, _Sadness_, _Anger_,\nand other like _Passions_.\nAs to What hapned to me from _Bodies without_, Besides the _Extension_,\n_Figure_, and _Motion_ of those _Bodies_, I also perceived in them\n_Hardness_, _Heat_, and other _tactile Qualities_, as also _Light_,\n_Colours_, _Smells_, _Tasts_, _Sounds_, &c. and by the _Variation_ of\nthese I _distinguish\u2019d_ the _Heaven_, _Earth_, and _Seas_, and all other\n_Bodies_ from each other.\nNeither was it wholly without Reason (upon the account of these _Ideas_\nof _Qualities_, which offer\u2019d themselves to my Thoughts, and which alone\nI _properly_ and _Immediately perceived_) that I thought my self to\nPerceive some Things _Different_ from my _Thought, viz._ The _Bodies_ or\n_Objects_ from whence these _Ideas_ might _Proceed_; for I often found\nthese _Ideas_ come upon me without my _Consent_ or _Will_; so that I can\nneither perceive an _Object_ (_tho I had a mind to it_) unless it were\n_before_ the Organs of my _Sense_; Neither can I _Hinder_ my self from\nperceiving it, when it is _Present_.\nAnd seeing that those _Ideas_ which I take in by sense are much more\n_Lively_, _Apparent_ and in their kind more _distinct_, than any of those\nwhich _I knowingly_ and _Willingly_ frame by Meditation, or stir up in\nmy _Memory_; it seems to me that they cannot proceed from _my self_.\nThere remains therefore no other way for them to come upon me, but from\nsome other Things _Without_ Me. Of Which Things seeing _I_ have no other\nKnowledge but from these _Ideas_, _I_ cannot Think but that these _Ideas_\nare _like_ the Things.\nMoreover, Because _I_ remember that _I_ first made use of my _senses_\nbefore my _Reason_; and because _I_ did perceive that those _Ideas_\nwhich _I_ my self did frame were not so _Manifest_ as those which _I_\nreceived by my _senses_, but very often _made up of their parts_, _I_ was\neasily perswaded to think that _I_ had no _Idea_ in my _Understanding_,\nwhich I had not _First_ in my _sense_.\nNeither was it without Reason that _I_ Judged, _That Body_ (which by a\n_peculiar right I_ call my _Own_) to be _more nighly_ appertaining to\n_Me_ then any _other Body_. For from It, as from other _Bodies_, _I_\ncan never be _seperated_, _I_ was _sensible_ of all _Appetites_ and\n_Affections in It_ and _for It_, and lastly _I_ perceived _pleasure_ and\n_Pain_ in its Parts, and not in any other Without it. But why from the\n_sense_ of Pain a certain _Grief_, and from the _sense_ of _pleasure_ a\ncertain _Joy_ of the _Mind_ should arise, or Why that _Gnawing_ of the\n_stomach_, Which _I_ call _Hunger_, should put me in mind of _Eating_, or\nthe _driness_ of my _Throat_ of _Drinking_, _I_ can give no other Reason\nbut _that I am taught so by Nature_. For to my thinking there is no\n_Affinity_ or _Likeness_ between that _Gnawing_ of the _Stomach_, and the\ndesire of _Eating_, or between the _sense_ of _Pain_, and the _sorrowful\nthought_ from thence arising. But in this as in all other _judgments_\nthat I made of _sensible objects_, I seem\u2019d to be taught by _Nature_, for\nI first perswaded my self that things were _so_ or _so_, before ever I\nenquired into a Reason that may prove it.\n[Sidenote: _The Reasons why I doubted my senses._]\n[Sidenote: _Medit. I._]\nBut afterwards I discover\u2019d many experiments, wherein my _senses_ so\ngrosly deceived me, that I would never trust them again; for Towers\nwhich seem\u2019d _Round_ a far off, nigh at hand appear\u2019d _square_, and\n_large_ Statues on their tops seem\u2019d _small_ to those that stood on the\nground; and in numberless other things, I perceived the _judgements_\nof my _outward senses_ were _deceived_: and not of my _outward_ only,\nbut of my _inward senses_ also; for what is more _intimate_ or _inward_\nthan _Pain_? And yet I have heard from those, whose Arm or Leg was cut\noff, that they have felt _pain_ in that part which they _wanted_, and\ntherefore I am not _absolutely certain_ that any part of me is affected\nwith _pain_, tho I _feel pain_ therein. To these I have lately added\ntwo very _general Reasons_ of _doubt_; The first was, that while I was\n_awake_, I could not believe my self to perceive any thing, which I could\nnot think my self sometimes to perceive, tho I were _a sleep_; And seeing\nI cannot believe, that what I seem to perceive in my _sleep_ proceeds\nfrom _outward Objects_, what greater Reason have I to think so of what I\nperceive whilst I am _awake_? The other Cause of Doubt was, that seeing\nI know not the _Author_ of my _Being_ (or at least I then _supposed_ my\nself not to know him) what reason is there but that I may be so ordered\nby _Nature_ as to be _deceived_ even in those things which appear\u2019d to me\nmost _true_. And as to the _Reasons_, which induced me to give _credit_\nto _sensible_ Things, \u2019twas easie to return an answer thereto, for\nfinding by experience, that I was impelled by _Nature_ to many Things,\nwhich _Reason_ disswaded me from, I thought I should not far trust what I\nwas taught by _Nature_. And tho the perceptions of my _senses_ depended\nnot on my _Will_, I thought _I_ should not therefore conclude, that they\nproceeded from _Objects different_ from my self; for perhaps there may\nbe some other _Faculty_ in me (tho as yet _unknown_ to me) which might\nframe those _perceptions_.\n[Sidenote: _How far the senses are now to be trusted._]\nBut now that I begin better to know _my self_ and the Author of my\n_Original_, I do not think, that all things, which I seem to have from my\n_senses_ are _rashly_ to be _admitted_, neither are all things so _had_,\nto be _doubted_. And first because I know that whatever I _clearly_\nand _distinctly_ perceive, _may be_ so made by _God_ as I perceive\nthem; the _Power_ of _understanding clearly_ and _distinctly_ one Thing\n_without_ the other is sufficient to make Me _certain_ that One Thing is\n_different_ from the Other; because it _may_ at least be placed apart by\n_God_, and that it may be esteem\u2019d _different_, it matters not by what\n_Power_ it _may_ be so _sever\u2019d_. And therefore from the knowledge I\nhave, that _I my self exist_, and because at the same time I understand\nthat nothing else appertains to my _Nature_ or _Essence_, but that I am a\n_thinking Being_, I rightly conclude, that my _Essence_ consists in this\nalone, that I am a _thinking Thing_. And tho _perhaps_ (or, as I shall\nshew presently, \u2019tis _certain_) I have a _Body_ which is very _nighly_\nconjoyned to me, yet because on this side I have a clear and _distinct\nIdea_ of my self, as I am only a _thinking Thing, not extended_; and on\nthe other side because I have a _distinct Idea_ of my _Body_, as it is\nonely an _extended_ thing, _not thinking_, \u2019tis from hence _certain_,\nthat I _am really distinct from my Body_, and that I can _exist without_\nit.\nMoreover I find in my self some _Faculties_ endow\u2019d with _certain_\npeculiar waies of _thinking_, such as the _Faculty_ of _Imagination_,\nthe _Faculty_ of _Perception_ or _sense_; without which _I_ can conceive\nmy _whole self clearly_ and _distinctly_, but (changing the phrase) _I_\ncannot _conceive_ those _Faculties_ without _conceiving My self_, that\nis, an _understanding substance_ in which they are; for none of them\nin their _formal Conception_ includes _understanding_; from whence I\nperceive they are as _different_ from _me_, as the _modus_ or _manner_ of\na Thing is _different_ from the _Thing it self_.\nI acknowledge also, that I have several other _Faculties_, such as\n_changing_ of _place_, _putting on various shapes_, &c. Which can\nno more be understood without a _substance_ in which they are, then\nthe foremention\u2019d _Faculties_, and consequently they can no more be\nunderstood to _Exist_ without that _substance_: But yet \u2019tis Manifest,\nthat this sort of _Faculties_, to the End they may exist, ought to be\nin a _Corporeal_, _Extended_, and not in an _Understanding substance_,\nbecause _Extension_, and not _Intellection_ or _Understanding_ is\nincluded in the _Clear_ and _Distinct conception_ of them.\nBut there is also in me a certain _Passive Faculty_ of _sense_, or of\n_Receiving_ and _Knowing_ the _Ideas_ of _sensible Things_; of which\n_Faculty_ I can make no use, unless there were in my self, or in\nsomething else, a certain _Active Faculty_ of _Producing_ and _Effecting_\nthose _Ideas_. But this cannot be in my self, for it Pre-supposes no\n_Understanding_, and those _Ideas_ are Produced in me, tho I help not,\nand often against my _Will_. There remains therefore no Place for this\n_Active Faculty_, but that it should be in some _substance different_\nfrom me. In which because all the _Reallity_, which is contain\u2019d\n_Objectively_ in the _Ideas_ Produced by that _Faculty_, ought to be\ncontain\u2019d _Formally_ or _Eminently_ (as I have Formerly taken notice)\nthis _substance_ must be either _a Body_ (in which what is in the\n_Ideas Objectively_ is contain\u2019d _Formally_) or it Must Be _God_, or\nsome _Creature_ more _excellent_ then a _Body_ (In which what is in the\n_Ideas Objectively_ is contain\u2019d _Eminently_). But seeing that _God_ is\nnot a _Deceivour_, \u2019tis altogether Manifest, that _he_ does not Place\nthese _Ideas_ in me either _Immediately_ from himself, or _Mediately_\nfrom any other Creature, wherein their _Objective Reallity_ is not *\ncontain\u2019d _Formally_, but only _Eminently_. And seeing _God_ has given\nme no _Faculty_ to discern Whether these Ideas proceed from _Corporeal_\nor _Incorporeal Beings_, but rather a _strong Inclination_ to believe\nthat they are sent from _Corporeal Beings_, there is no Reason Why God\nshould not be counted a _Deceiver_, if these _Ideas_ came from any Where,\nbut from _Corporeal Things_. Therefore we must conclude that there are\n_Corporeal Beings_. Which perhaps are not all the same as I comprehend\nthem by _my sense_ (for Perception by sense is in many Things very\n_Obscure_ and _Confused_) but those things at least, which I _clearly_\nand _distinctly_ Understand, that is to say, all those things which are\ncomprehended under the _Object_ of _Pure Mathematicks_; those things I\nsay at least are _True_.\nAs to What Remains, They are either some _Particulars_, as that the\nSun is of such a _Bigness_ or _Shape_, _&c._ or they are Things less\n_Clearly_ Understood, as _Light_, _Sound_, _Pain_, &c. And tho these and\nsuch like Things may be very _Doubtful_ and _Uncertain_, yet because\n_God_ is not a _Deceiver_, and because that (Therefore) none of my\nOpinions can be _false_ unless God has Given me some _Faculty_ or other\nto _Correct_ my _Error_, hence \u2019tis that I am incouraged with the Hopes\nof attaining _Truth_ even in these very Things.\nAnd certainly it cannot be doubted but whatever _I_ am taught by _Nature_\nhas something therein of _Truth_. By _Nature_ in General I understand\neither _God_ himself, or the _Coordination_ of Creatures Made by God.\nBy my _Own Nature_ in _Particular_ I understand the _Complexion_ or\n_Association_ of all those things which are given me by God.\nNow there is nothing that this _my Nature_ teaches me more _expresly_\nthen that I have a _Body_, Which is not _Well_ when I _feel Pain_, that\nthis _Body_ wants _Meat_ or _Drink_ When I am _Hungry_ or _Dry_, _&c._\nAnd therefore I ought not to Doubt but that these things are _True_. And\nby this _sense_ of _Pain_, _Hunger_, _Thirst_, &c. My _Nature_ tells me\nthat _I_ am not in my _Body_, as a _Mariner_ is in his _Ship_, but that I\nam most _nighly conjoyn\u2019d_ thereto, and as it were _Blended therewith_;\nso that _I_ with _It_ make up _one_ thing; For Otherwise, when the _Body_\nwere hurt, _I_, who am only a _Thinking Thing_, should not therefore\n_feel_ Pain, but should only _perceive_ the Hurt with the _Eye_ of my\n_Understanding_ (as a _Mariner perceives_ by his _sight_ whatever is\nbroken in his Ship) and when the _Body_ wants either Meat or Drink, I\nshould only _Understand_ this want, but should not have the _Confused\nsense_ of _Hunger_ or _Thirst_; I call them _Confused_, for certainly\nthe _Sense_ of _Thirst_, _Hunger_, _Pain_, &c. are only _Confused Modes_\nor _Manners_ of _Thought_ arising from the _Union_ and (as it were)\n_mixture_ of the _Mind_ and _Body_.\nI am taught also by _Nature_, that there are many other _Bodies Without_\nand _About_ my _Body_, some whereof are to be _desired_, others are to\nbe _Avoided_. And because that I Perceive very Different _Colours_,\n_Sounds_, _Smells_, _Tasts_, _Heat_, _Hardness_, and the Like, from\nthence I Rightly conclude that there are _Correspondent Differences_ in\n_Bodies_, from which these _different perceptions_ of _sense_ proceed,\ntho perhaps not _Alike_. And because that some of these _perceptions_\nare _Pleasant_, others _Unpleasant_, \u2019tis evidently _certain_, that my\n_Body_, or rather my _Whole self_ (as _I_ am compounded of a _Mind_ and\n_Body_) am liable to be _Affected_ by these _Bodies_ which encompass me\nabout.\nThere are many Other Things Also which _Nature_ seems to teach Me, but\n_Really_ I am not taught by It, but have gotten them by an _ill use_ of\nPassing my Judgement _Inconsiderately_, and from hence it is that these\nthings happen often to be _false_; as that all _space_ is _Empty_, in\nwhich I find _nothing_ that _works_ upon my _Senses_; That in a _hot\nBody_ there is something _like_ the _Idea_ of _Heat_ which is in me; That\nin a _White_ or _Green_ Body there is the same _Whiteness_ or _Greenness_\nwhich I _perceive_; And the same _Taste_ in a _bitter_ or _sweet_ Thing,\n_&c._ That _Stars_, _Castles_, and Other _Remote_ Bodies are of the same\n_Bigness_ and _Shape_, as they are _Represented_ to my _senses_: and\nsuch like. But that I may not admit of any Thing in this very matter,\nwhich I cannot _Distinctly_ perceive, it behoves me here to determine\nmore _Accurately_ What I mean when I say, _That I am taught a Thing by\nNature_.\nHere I take _Nature_ more _strictly_, then for the _Complication_ of all\nthose Things which are Given me by _God_; For in this _Complication_\nthere are many things contain\u2019d which relate to the _Mind alone_, as,\nThat I perceive What is _done_ cannot be _not Done_, and all Other things\nwhich are known by the _Light_ of _Nature_, but of these I speak not at\npresent. There are also many Other Things which belong _only_ to the\n_Body_, as, That it _tends Downwards_ and such like, of these also I\ntreat not at Present. But I speak of those Things only which _God_ hath\nbestowed upon me as I am _Compounded_ of a _Mind_ and _Body together_,\nand not _differently Consider\u2019d_. \u2019Tis _Nature_ therefore thus taken that\nteaches me to _avoid troublesome Objects_, and _seek_ after _pleasing\nOnes_; but it appears not that this _Nature_ teaches us to conclude any\nthing of these Perceptions of our _senses_, before that we make by our\n_Understanding_ a diligent examination of _outward Objects_; for to\nEnquire into the _Truth_ of Things belongs not to the _Whole Compositum_\nof a Man as he Consists of _Mind_ and _Body_, but to the _Mind alone_.\nSo that tho a _star affect_ my eye no _more_ then a _small spark_ of\nFire, yet there is in my Eye no _Real_ or _Positive Inclination_ to\n_believe_ One no bigger then the Other, but thus I have been used to\nJudge from my Childhood without any Reason: and tho coming nigh the Fire\nI feel Heat, and Coming too nigh I feel Pain, yet there is no Reason to\nperswade me, That in the Fire there is any thing _like_ either that Heat\nor that Pain, but only that there is something therein, Whatever it be,\nthat excites in us those _sensations_ of Heat or Pain: and so tho in some\nspace there may be nothing that Works on my _senses_, it does not from\nthence follow, that there is no _Body_ there; for I see that in these\nand many other things I am used to overturn the Order of Nature, because\nI use these _perceptions_ of _sense_ (which properly are given me by\nNature to make known to the mind what is _advantagious_ or _hurtful_ to\nthe _Compositum_, whereof the _mind_ is part, and _so far_ only they are\n_Clear_ and _Distinct_ enough) as _certain Rules_ immediately to discover\nthe _Essence_ of _External Bodies_, of Which they make known nothing but\nvery _Obscurely_ and _Confusedly_.\n[Sidenote: Medit. 4.]\nI have * formerly shewn how my _Judgement_ happens to be false\nnotwithstanding _Gods Goodness_. But now there arises a new _Difficulty_\nconcerning those very things which _Nature_ tells me I am to _prosecute_\nor _avoid_, concerning my _Internal senses_, Wherein I find many\n_Errors_, as when a Man being deceived by the Pleasant Taste of some sort\nof Meat, devours therein some hidden Poyson. But in this very Instance\nit cannot be said, that the Man is impelled by Nature to desire the\n_Poyson_, for of that he is wholly Ignorant; but he is said to Desire\nthe _Meat_ only as being of a grateful Taste; and from hence nothing can\nbe concluded but, That _Mans-Nature_ is not _All-knowing_; which is no\nWonder seeing Man is a _Finite Being_, and therefore nothing but _Finite\nPerfections_ belong to him.\nBut We often err even in those things to Which we are _Impelled_ by\n_Nature_, as when sick men desire that _Meat_ or _Drink_, which will\ncertainly prove Hurtful to them. To this it may perhaps be reply\u2019d, That\nthey _Err_ in this because their _Nature_ is _Corrupt_. But this Answers\nnot the Difficulty, For a sick man is no less _Gods Creature_ then a Man\nin Health, and therefore \u2019tis as Absurd to Imagine a _Deceitful Nature_\nimposed by _God_ on the One as on the Other; And as a Clock that is made\nup of Wheels and Weights does no less strictly observe the _Laws_ of its\n_Nature_, when it is _ill_ contrived, and tells the hours _falsly_, as\nwhen it answers the Desire of the Artificer in all performances; so if\nI consider the body of a Man as a meer _Machine_ or _Movement_, made up\nand compounded of _Bones_, _Nerves_, _Muscles_, _Veins_, _Blood_, and\n_Skin_; so that, tho there were no _mind_ in It, yet It would perform all\nthose Motions which now are in it (those only excepted which Proceed from\nthe _Will_, and consequently from the _Mind_) I do easily acknowledge,\nthat it would be as _natural_ for him (if for example sake he were sick\nof a _Dropsie_) to suffer that _Driness_ of his _Throat_ which uses to\nbring into his mind the _sense_ of _Thirst_, & that thereby his Nerves\nand other Parts would be so disposed as to take Drink, by Which his\ndisease would be encreased; As (supposing him to be troubled with no\nsuch Distemper) by the like Driness of Throat he would be disposed to\nDrink, when \u2019tis Requisite. And tho, if I respect the Intended use of a\nClock I may say that it _Errs_ from its _Nature_, when it tells the Hours\n_wrong_, and so considering the _Movement_ of a _Mans Body_ as contrived\nfor such _Motions_ as are used to be performed thereby, I may think That\nalso to _Err_ from its _Nature_, if its _Throat_ is _Dry_, when it has\nno want of Drink for its _Preservation_. Yet I Plainly discover, that\nthis last _Acceptation_ of _Nature_ differs much from that whereof we\nhave been speaking all this While, for this is only a _Denomination\nextrinsick_ to the Things whereof \u2019tis spoken, and _depending_ on my\n_Thought_, while it _Compares_ a _sick_ man, and a _disorderly_ Clock\nwith the _Idea_ of an _healthy_ man and a _Rectified_ Clock. But by\n_Nature_ in its former _Acceptation_ I Understand something that is\n_Really_ in the _Things_ themselves, which therefore has something of\n_Truth_ in it.\nBut tho Respecting only a _Body sick_ of a Dropsie it be an _Extrinsick\nDenomination_ to say, that its _Nature_ is _Corrupt_, because it has\na _Dry Throat_, and stands in _no need_ of Drink; yet respecting the\n_Whole Compound_ or _Mind joyn\u2019d_ to such a _Body_, \u2019tis not a _meer\nDenomination_, but a _real Error_ of _Nature_ for it to _thirst_ when\n_drink_ is _hurtful_ to it. It remains therefore here to be inquired, how\nthe _Goodness_ of _God_ suffers _Nature so taken_ to be _deceivable_.\nFirst therefore I understand that a _chief difference_ between my _Mind_\nand _Body_ consists in this, That my _Body_ is of its _Nature divisible_,\nbut my _Mind indivisible_; for while I consider my _Mind_ or _my self_,\nas I am only a _thinking Thing_, I can distinguish _no parts_ in Me,\nbut I perceive my self to be but _one entire_ Thing; and tho the _whole\nMind_ seems to be _united_ to the _whole Body_, yet a Foot, an Arm, or\nany other part of the Body being cut off, I do not therefore conceive\nany _part_ of my _Mind_ taken away; Neither can its _Faculties_ of\n_desiring_, _perceiving_, _understanding_, &c. be called its _Parts_, for\n\u2019tis one and the _same_, _mind_, that _desires_, that _perceives_, that\n_understands_; Contrarily, I cannot think of any _Corporeal_ or _extended\nBeing_, which I cannot easily _divide_ into _Parts_ by my thought, and by\nthis I understand it to be _divisible_. And this alone (if I had known it\nfrom no other Argument) is sufficient to inform me, that my _mind_ is\n_really distinct_ from my _Body_.\nNextly I find, that my _mind_ is not _immediately affected_ by all parts\nof my _body_, but only by the _Brain_, and perhaps only by one small part\nof it, That, to wit, wherein the _common sense_ is said to reside; Which\npart, as often as it is disposed in the _same manner_, will represent to\nthe _mind_ the _same thing_, tho at the same time the other parts of the\n_body_ may be _differently_ order\u2019d. And this is proved by numberless\nExperiments, which need not here be related.\nMoreover I discover that the _nature_ of my _body_ is such, that no part\nof it can be _moved_ by an other _remote_ part thereof, but it may also\nbe _moved_ in the _same manner_ by some of the _interjacent_ parts, tho\nthe more _remote_ part lay still and acted not; As for example in the\nRope,\nA\u2e3aB\u2e3aC\u2e3aD\nif its end D. were drawn, the end A. would be moved no otherwise, than\nif one of the intermediate parts B. or C. were drawn, and the end D.\nrest quiet. So when I feel _pain_ in my _Foot_, the consideration of\nPhysicks instructs me, that this is performed by the help of _Nerves_\ndispersed through the Foot, which from thence being _continued_ like\nRopes to the very Brain, whilst they are _drawn_ in the Foot, they also\n_draw_ the inward parts of the Brain to which they reach, and therein\nexcite a certain _motion_, which is ordain\u2019d by _Nature_ to affect the\n_mind_ with a _sense_ of _Pain_, as being in the _Foot_. But because\nthese Nerves must pass through the _Shin_, the _Thighs_, the _Loins_, the\n_Back_, the _Neck_, before they can reach the _Brain_ from the _Foot_, it\nmay so happen, that tho _that part_ of them, which is in the Foot were\nnot touch\u2019d, but only some of their _intermediate parts_, yet the same\n_motion_, would be caused in the _Brain_, as when the _Foot_ it self is\n_ill affected_, from whence \u2019twill necessarily follow, that the _mind_\nshould _perceive_ the same _Pain_. And thus may we think of any other\n_Sense_.\nI understand lastly, that seeing each single motion perform\u2019d in that\npart of the _Brain_, which _immediately affects_ the _mind_, excites\ntherein only one sort of _sense_, nothing could be contrived more\nconveniently in this case, than that, of all those _Senses_ which it\ncan cause, it should cause that which _cheifly_, and most _frequently_\nconduces to the _conservation_ of an _healthful Man_; And experience\nwitnesses, that to this very _end_ all our _senses_ are given us by\n_Nature_; and therefore nothing can be found therein, which does not\nabundantly testifie the _Power_ and _Goodness_ of _God_. Thus for\nExample, when the Nerves of the Feet are violently and more than\nordinarily moved, that motion of them being propagated through the\n_Medulla Spinalis_ of the Back to the inward parts of the Brain, there it\nsignifies to the mind, that something or other is to be felt, and what is\nthis but Pain, as if it were in the Foot, by which the Mind is excited\nto use its indeavours for removing the Cause, as being hurtful to the\nFoot. But the _Nature_ of _Man_ might have been so _order\u2019d_ by _God_,\nthat That same motion in the Brain should represent to the mind any other\nthing, _viz._ either it self as \u2019tis in the Brain, or it self as it is\nin the Foot, or in any of the other forementioned intermediate parts, or\nlastly any other thing whatsoever; but none of these would have so much\nconduced to the _Conservation_ of the _Body_. In the like manner when we\nwant drink, from thence arises a certain _dryness_ in the _Throat_, which\nmoves the Nerves thereof, and by their means the inward parts of the\nBrain, and this motion _affects_ the _mind_ with the _sense_ of _thirst_;\nbecause that in this case nothing is more requisite for us to know, then\nthat we _want drink_ for the _Preservation_ of our _Health_. So of the\nRest.\nFrom all which \u2019tis manifest, that (notwithstanding the _infinite\nGoodness_ of God) \u2019tis impossible but the _Nature_ of _Man_ as he\nconsists of a _mind_ and _body_ should be _deceivable_. For if any cause\nshould excite (not in the Foot but) in the Brain it self, or in any\nother part through which the Nerves are continued from the Foot to the\nBrain, that _self same_ motion, which uses to arise from the Foot being\ntroubled, the _Pain_ would be felt _as in the Foot_, and the _sense_\nwould be _naturally_ deceived; for \u2019tis consonant to Reason (seeing that\nThat same motion of the Brain alwayes represents to the mind that same\nsense, and it oftner proceeds from a cause _hurtful_ to the _Foot_, than\nfrom any other) I say \u2019tis reasonable, that it should make known to the\n_mind_ the Pain of the _Foot_, rather than of any other _part_. And so\nif a _dryness_ of _Throat_ arises (not as \u2019tis used from the _necessity_\nof _drink_ for the _conservation_ of the _Body_, but) from an _unusual\nCause_, as it happens in a _Dropsie_, \u2019tis far better that it should\n_then deceive us_; then that it should _alwayes deceive_ us when the\n_Body_ is in _Health_, and so of the Rest.\nAnd this consideration helps me very much, not only to _understand_ the\n_Errors_ to which my _Nature_ is subject, but also to _correct_ and\n_avoid_ them. For seeing I know that all my _Senses_ do oftener inform\nme _falsly_ than _truely_ in those things which conduce to the _Bodies\nadvantage_; and seeing I can use (almost alwayes) more of them than one\nto _Examine_ the same thing, as also I can use _memory_, which joyns\npresent and past things together, and my _understanding_ also, which\nhath already discovered to me all the _causes_ of my _Errors_, I ought\nno longer to fear, that what my _Senses_ daily represent to me should be\nfalse. But especially those _extravagant Doubts_ of my First Meditation\nare to be turn\u2019d off as ridiculous; and perticularly the _chief_ of\nthem, _viz_. That * of not _distinguishing Sleep_ from _Waking_, for now\nI plainly discover a great _difference_, between them, for my _Dreams_\nare never _conjoyned_ by my _memory_ with the other _actions_ of _my\nlife_, as whatever happens to me _awake_ is; and certainly if (while\nI were awake) any person should suddenly appear to me, and presently\ndisappear (as in _Dreams_) so that I could not tell _from whence_ he\ncame or _where_ he went, I should rather esteem it a _Spectre_ or\n_Apparition feign\u2019d_ in my Brain, then a _true Man_; but when such\nthings occur, as I distinctly know from _whence_, _where_, and _when_\nthey come, and I _conjoyn_ the _perception_ of them by my _memory_ with\nthe other _Accidents_ of my _life_, I am _certain_ they are represented\nto me _waking_ and not _asleep_, neither ought I in the least to doubt\nof their _Truth_, if after I have called up all my _senses_, _memory_,\nand _understanding_ to their _Examination_ I find nothing in any of\nthem, that clashes with other truths; For _God_ not being a _Deceiver_,\nit follows, that In such things I am not _deceived_. But because the\n_urgency_ of _Action_ in the common _occurrences_ of _Affairs_ will not\nalwayes allow time for such an _accurate examination_, I must confess\nthat _Mans life_ is _subject_ to many _Errors_ about _perticulars_, so\nthat the _infirmity_ of our _Nature_ must be _acknowledged_ by Us.\n_FINIS._\nADVERTISEMENT CONCERNING THE OBJECTIONS.\nAmong seven Parcels of Objections made by Divers Learned Persons against\nthese Meditations, I have made choise of the Third in the Latine Copy,\nas being Penn\u2019d by _Thomas Hobbs_ of _Malmesbury_, a Man famously known\nto the World abroad, but especially to his own the English Nation; and\ntherefore \u2019tis likely that what comes from Him may be more acceptable to\nhis Countrymen, then what proceeds from a Stranger; and as the strength\nof a Fortification is never better known then by a Forcible Resistance,\nso fares it with these _Meditations_ which stand unshaken by the\nViolent Opposition of so Potent an Enemy. And yet it must be Confess\u2019d\nthat the Force of these Objections and Cogency of the Arguments cannot\nbe well apprehended by those who are not versed in other Pieces of Mr.\n_Hobbs_\u2019s Philosophy, especially His Book _De Corpore_ and _De Homine_,\nThe former whereof I am sure is Translated into English, and therefore\nnot Impertinently refer\u2019d to Here in a Discourse to English Readers. And\nthis is the Reason that makes the Great _Des-Cartes_ pass over many of\nthese Objections so slightly, Who certainly would have Undermined the\nwhole Fabrick of the _Hobbian Philosophy_ had he but known upon What\nFoundations it was Built.\nOBJECTIONS\nMade against the Foregoing\nMEDITATIONS,\nBY THE FAMOUS\n_THOMAS HOBBS_\nOf MALMESBURY,\nWITH\n_DES-CARTES\u2019S_\nANSWERS.\nOBJECT. I.\n_Against the First Meditation: Of things Doubtful._\n\u2019Tis evident enough from What has been said in this Meditation, that\nthere is no _sign_ by Which we may Distinguish our _Dreams_ from _True\nSense_ and _Waking_, and therefore that those _Phantasmes_ which we\nhave waking and from our Senses are not accidents inhering in Outward\nObjects, neither do they Prove that such outward Objects do Exist; and\ntherefore if we trust our Senses without any other Ground, we may well\ndoubt whether any Thing _Be_ or _Not_. We therefore acknowledge the Truth\nof this Meditation. But Because _Plato_ and other Antient Philosophers\nargued for the same _incertainty_ in sensible Things, and because \u2019tis\ncommonly Observed by the Vulgar that \u2019tis hard to Distinguish Sleep from\nWaking, I would not have the most excellent Author of such new Thoughts\nput forth so antique Notions.\nANSWER.\nThose Reasons of Doubt which by this Philosopher are admitted as _true_,\nwere proposed by Me only as _Probable_, and I made use of them not that\nI may vend them as _new_, but partly that I may prepare the Minds of my\nReaders for the Consideration of Intellectual Things, wherein they seem\u2019d\nto me very necessary; And partly that thereby I may shew how firm those\nTruths are, which hereafter I lay down, seeing they cannot be Weaken\u2019d by\nthese Metaphysical Doubts: So, that I never designed to gain any Honor by\nrepeating them, but I think I could no more omit them, then a Writer in\nPhysick can pass over the Description of a Disease, Whose Cure he intends\nto Teach.\nOBJECT. II.\n_Against the Second Meditation: Of the Nature of Mans Mind._\nI _am a Thinking Thing_. \u2019Tis True; for because I _think_ or have a\n_Phantasme_ (whether I am _awake_ or _asleep_) it follows that _I am\nThinking_, for _I Think_ and _I am Thinking_ signifie the same Thing.\nBecause _I Think_, it follows That _I am_, for whatever _Thinks_ cannot\nbe _Nothing_. But when he Adds, _That is_, _a Mind_, _a Soul_, _an\nUnderstanding_, _Reason_, I question his Argumentation; for it does not\nseem a Right Consequence to say, _I am a Thinking Thing_, therefore _I am\na Thought_, neither, _I am an Understanding Thing_, therefore _I am the\nUnderstanding_. For in the same manner I may Conclude, _I am a Walking\nThing_, therefore _I am the Walking it self_.\nWherefore _D.Cartes_ Concludes that an _Understanding Thing_ and\n_Intellection_ (which is the _Act_ of an Understanding Thing) are the\nsame; or at least that an _Understanding Thing_ and the _Intellect_\n(which is the _Power_ of an Understanding Thing) are the same; And yet\nall Philosophers distinguish the _subject_ from its _Faculties_ and\n_Acts_, that is, from its _Properties_ and _Essence_, for the _Thing it\nself_ is one thing, and its _Essence_ is an other. It may be therefore\nthat a _Thinking Thing_ is the _Subject_ of a _Mind_, _Reason_, or\n_Understanding_, and therefor it may be a _Corporeal Thing_, the Contrary\nWhereof is here _Assumed_ and not _Proved_; and yet this _Inference_ is\nthe _Foundation_ of that Conclusion which _D.Cartes_ would Establish.\n[Sidenote: * _Places noted with this Asterick are the Passages of the\nforegoing Meditations here Objected against._]\nIn the same Meditation, on, * _I know that I am, I ask, What I am Whom I\nThus Know, Certainly the Knowledge of Me precisely so taken depends not\non those Things of whose Existence I am yet Ignorant_.\n\u2019Tis Certain the Knowledge of this Proposition _I am_, depends on this,\n_I think_ as he hath rightly inform\u2019d us; but from whence have we the\nknowledge of this Proposition, _I think_? certainly from hence only,\nthat we cannot conceive any _Act_ without its _subject_, as _dancing_\nwithout a _Dancer_, _knowledge_, without a _Knower_, _thought_ without a\n_thinker_.\nAnd from hence it seems to follow, that a _thinking Thing_ is a\n_Corporeal Thing_; for the _Subjects_ of all _Acts_ are understood only\nin a _Corporeal way_, or after the manner of _matter_, as he himself\nshews hereafter by the example of a piece of Wax, which changing its\n_colour_, _consistence_, _shape_, and other _Acts_ is yet known to\ncontinue the _same thing_, that is, the _same matter subject_ to so many\n_changes_. But I cannot conclude from another _thought_ that _I now\nthink_; for tho a Man may _think_ that he _hath thought_ (which consists\nonly in _memory_) yet \u2019tis altogether impossible for him to _think_ that\nhe _now thinks_, or to _know_, that _he knows_, for the question may be\nput _infinitely_, how do you _know_ that you _know_, that you _know_,\nthat you _know_? &c.\nWherefore seeing the Knowledge of this Proposition _I am_, depends on\nthe knowledge of this _I think_, and the knowledge of this is from hence\nonly, that we cannot separate _thought_ from _thinking matter_, it seems\nrather to follow, that a _thinking thing_ is _material_, than that \u2019tis\n_immaterial_.\nANSWER.\nWhen I said, _That is a Mind_, _a Soul_, _an Understanding_, _Reason_,\n&c. I did not mean by these _names_ the _Faculties_ only, but the\n_things_ indow\u2019d with those _Faculties_; and so \u2019tis alwayes understood\nby the two first names (_mind_ and _soul_) and very often so understood\nby the two last Names (_understanding_ and _Reason_) and this I have\nexplain\u2019d so often, and in so many places of these Meditations, that\nthere is not the least occasion of questioning my meaning.\nNeither is there any parity between _Walking_ and _Thought_, for\n_walking_ is used only for the _Act_ it self, but _thought_ is sometimes\nused for the _Act_, sometimes for the _Faculty_, and sometimes for the\n_thing_ it self, wherein the _Faculty_ resides.\nNeither do I say, that the _understanding thing_ and _intellection_ are\nthe same, or that the _understanding thing_ and the _intellect_ are the\nsame, if the _intellect_ be taken for the _Faculty_, but only when \u2019tis\ntaken for the _thing it self that understands_. Yet I willingly confess,\nthat I have (as much as in me lay) made use of _abstracted words_ to\nsignifie that _thing_ or _substance_, which I would have devested of all\nthose things that belong not to it. Whereas contrarily this Philosopher\nuses the most _concrete Words_ to signifie this _thinking thing_, such\nas _subject_, _matter_, _Body_, &c. that he may not suffer it to be\nseparated from _Body_.\nNeither am I concern\u2019d that His manner of joyning many things together\nmay seem to some fitter for the discovery of Truth, than mine, wherein I\nseparate as much as possibly each particular. But let us omit words and\nspeak of things.\n_It may be_ (sayes he) _that a Thinking thing is a corporeal thing,\nthe contrary whereof is here assumed and not proved._ But herein he is\nmistaken, for I never _assumed_ the _contrary_, neither have I used it as\na _Foundation_, for the rest of _my Superstructure_, but left it wholly\n_undetermin\u2019d_ till the _sixth Meditation_, and in that \u2019tis proved.\nThen he tells us rightly, _that we cannot conceive any Act without its\nsubject_, as _thought_ without a _thinking thing_, for what _thinks_\ncannot be _nothing_; but then he subjoyns without any Reason, and against\nthe usual manner of speaking, and contrary to all Logick, _that hence it\nseem to follow, that a thinking thing is a corporeal Being_. Truly the\n_subjects_ of all _Acts_ are understood under the notion of _substance_,\nor if you please under the notion of _matter_ (that is to say of\n_metaphysical matter_) but not therefore under the notion of _Bodies_.\nBut Logicians and Commonly all Men are used to say, that there are some\n_Spiritual_, some _Corporeal_ substances. And by the Instance of Wax I\nonly proved that _Colour_, _Consistence_, _Shape_, &c. appertain not to\nthe _Ratio Formalis_ of the Wax; For in that Place I treated neither of\nthe _Ratio Formalis_ of the _Mind_, neither of _Body_.\nNeither is it pertinent to the business, that the Philosopher asserts,\n_That one Thought cannot be the subject of an other thought_, for Who\nbesides Himself ever Imagin\u2019d This? But that I may explain the matter in\na few words, \u2019Tis certain that _Thought_ cannot be without a _Thinking\nThing_, neither any _Act_ or any _Accident_ without a _substance_ wherein\nit resides. But seeing that we know not a _substance immediately by it\nself_, but by this alone, that \u2019tis the _subject_ of several _Acts_, it\nis very consonant to the commands of Reason and Custome, that we should\ncall by _different names_ those _substances_, which we perceive are the\n_subjects_ of very _different Acts_ or _Accidents_, and that afterwards\nwe should examine, whether those _different names_ signifie _different_\nor _one_ and the _same_ thing. Now there are some _Acts_ which we call\n_corporeal_, as _magnitude_, _figure_, _motion_, and what ever else\ncannot be thought on without _local extension_, and the _substance_\nwherein these reside we call _Body_; neither can it be imagin\u2019d that\n\u2019tis one _substance_ which is the _subject_ of _Figure_, and another\n_substance_ which is the _subject_ of _local motion_, &c. Because all\nthese _Acts_ agree under one common notion of _Extension_. Besides\nthere are other _Acts_, which we call _cogitative_ or _thinking_, as\n_understanding_, _will_, _imagination_, _sense_, &c. All which agree\nunder the common notion of _thought_, _perception_, or _Conscience_;\nAnd the _substance_ wherein they are, we say, is a _thinking thing_,\nor _mind_, or call it by whatever other name we please, so we do not\nconfound it with _corporeal substance_, because _cogitative Acts_ have\nno affinity with _corporeal Acts_, and _thought_, which is the common\n_Ratio_ of _those_ is wholly different from _Extension_, which is the\ncommon _Ratio_ of _These_. But after we have formed two _distinct\nconceptions_ of these two _substances_, from what is said in the sixth\nMeditation, \u2019tis easie to know, whether they be _one_ and the _same_ or\n_different_.\nOBJECT. III.\n* _Which of them is it, that is distinct from my thought? which of them\nis it that can be separated from me?_\nSome perhaps will answer this Question thus, I my self, who _think_ am\ndistinct from my _thought_, and my _thought_ is _different_ from me\n(tho\u2019 not _seperated_) as _dancing_ is _distinguished_ from the _Dancer_\n(as before is noted.) But if _Des-Cartes_ will prove, that _he_ who\n_understands_ is the same with his _understanding_, we shall fall into\nthe Scholastick expressions, the _understanding understands_, the _sight\nsees_, the _Will wills_, and then by an exact analogy, the Walking (or\nat least the _Faculty_ of walking) shall walk. All which are obscure,\nimproper, and unworthy that perspicuity which is usual with the noble\n_Des-Cartes_.\nANSWER.\nI do not deny, that _I_ who _think_ am _distinct_ from my _thought_,\nas a _thing_ is _distinguish\u2019d_ from its _modus_ or _manner_; But when\nI ask, _which of them is it that is distinct from my thought_? this I\nunderstand of those various _modes_ of _thought_ there mention\u2019d, and\nnot of _substance_; and when I subjoyn, _which of them is it that can be\nseparated from me_? I only signifie that all those _modes_ or _manners_\nof _thinking_ reside in me, neither do I herein perceive what occasion of\n_doubt_ or _obscurity_ can be imagined.\nOBJECT. IV.\n* _It remains therefore for me to Confess that I cannot Imagine what this\nWax is, but that I conceive in my mind What it is._\nThere is a great Difference between _Imagination_ (that is) having\nan _Idea_ of a Thing, and the _Conception of the Mind_ (that is) a\n_Concluding_ from _Reasoning_ that a thing _Is_ or _Exists_. But\n_Des-Cartes_ has not Declared to us in what they Differ. Besides,\nthe Ancient Aristotelians have clearly deliver\u2019d as a Doctrine, that\n_substance_ is not _perceived_ by _sense_ but is _Collected_ by\n_Ratiocination_.\nBut what shall we now say, if perhaps _Ratiocination_ be nothing Else but\na _Copulation_ or _Concatenation_ of _Names_ or _Appellations_ by this\nWord _Is_? From whence \u2019twill follow that we _Collect_ by _Reasoning_\nnothing _of_ or _concerning_ the _Nature_ of _Things_, but of the _names_\nof _Things_, that is to say, we only discover whether or no we _joyn_ the\n_Names_ of _Things_ according to the _Agreements_ which at Pleasure we\nhave made concerning their _significations_; if it be so (as so it may\nbe) _Ratiocination_ will depend on _Words_, _Words_ on _Imagination_,\nand perhaps _Imagination_ as _also Sense_ on the _Motion_ of _Corporeal\nParts_; and so the _Mind_ shall be nothing but _Motions_ in some Parts of\nan _Organical Body_.\nANSWER.\nI have here Explain\u2019d the Difference between _Imagination_, and the Meer\n_Conception_ of the _Mind_, by reckoning up in my Example of the Wax,\nwhat it is therein which we _Imagine_, and what it is that we _conceive_\nin our _Mind_ only: but besides this, I have explained in an other Place\nHow we _understand_ one way, and _Imagine_ an other way One and the same\nThing, suppose a Pentagone or Five sided Figure.\nThere is in _Ratiocination_ a _Conjunction_ not of _Words_, but of\n_Things signified_ by _Words_; And I much admire that the _Contrary_\ncould Possibly enter any Mans Thoughts; For Who ever doubted but that\na _Frenchman_ and a _German_ may argue about the _same Things_, tho\nthey use very _Differing Words_? and does not the Philosopher Disprove\nhimself when he speaks of the _Agreements which at pleasure we have made\nabout the significations of Words_? for if he grants that _something_ is\n_Signified_ by _Words_, Why will he not admit that our Ratiocinations are\nrather about this _something_, then about _Words_ only? and by the same\nRight that he concludes the _Mind_ to be a _Motion_, he may Conclude Also\nthat the Earth is Heaven, or What else he Pleases.\nOBJECT. V.\n_Against the Third Meditation of God._\n* _Some of These (viz. ~Humane Thoughts~) are as it were the Images of\nThings, and to these alone belongs properly the Name of an Idea, as when\nI Think on a Man, a Chimera, Heaven, an Angel, or God._\nWhen I Think on a _Man_ I perceive an _Idea_ made up of _Figure_ and\n_Colour_, whereof I may _doubt_ whether it be the _Likeness_ of a _Man_\nor not; and so when I think on _Heaven_. But when I think on a Chimera, I\nperceive an _Image_ or _Idea_, of which I may _doubt_ whether it be the\n_Likeness_ of any _Animal_ not only at present Existing, but possible to\nExist, or that ever will Exist hereafter or not.\nBut thinking on an _Angel_, there is offer\u2019d to my Mind sometimes the\n_Image_ of a _Flame_, sometimes the _Image_ of a _Pretty Little Boy_\nwith _Wings_, which I am certain has no _Likeness_ to an _Angel_, and\ntherefore that it is not the _Idea_ of an _Angel_; But beleiving that\nthere are some Creatures, Who do (as it were) wait upon God, and are\nInvisible, and Immaterial, upon the _Thing Believed_ or _supposed_ we\nImpose the _Name_ of _Angel_; Whereas the _Idea_, under which I Imagine\nan Angel, is compounded of the Ideas of sensible Things.\nIn the like manner at the Venerable Name of _God_, we have _no Image_ or\n_Idea_ of God, and therefore we are forbidden to _Worship God_ under any\n_Image_, least we should seem to _Conceive_ Him that is inconceivable.\nWhereby it appears that we have no _Idea_ of _God_; but like one _born\nblind_, who being brought to the _Fire_, and perceiving himself to be\n_Warmed_, knows there is _something_ by which he is _warmed_ and Hearing\nit called _Fire_, he Concludes that _Fire Exists_, but yet knows not of\nwhat _shape_ or _Colour_ the Fire is, neither has he any _Image_ or\n_Idea_ thereof in his _Mind_.\nSo Man knowing that there must be some _Cause_ of his _Imaginations_\nor _Ideas_, as also an other _cause before That_, and so _onwards_, he\nis brought at last to an _End_, or to a _supposal_ of some _Eternal\nCause_, Which because it never _began_ to _Be_ cannot have any other\n_Cause before it_, and thence he Concludes that \u2019tis _necessary_ that\nsome _Eternal Thing Exist_: and yet he has no _Idea_ which He can call\nthe _Idea_ of this _Eternal Thing_, but he names this _Thing_, which he\nbelieves and acknowledges by the Name _God_.\nBut now _Des-Cartes_ proceeds from this Position, _That we have an Idea\nof God in our Mind_, to prove this Theoreme, _That God (that if an\nAlmighty, Wise, Creatour of the World) Exists_, whereas he ought to have\nexplain\u2019d this _Idea_ of _God_ better, and he should have thence deduced\nnot only his _Existence_, but also the _Creation_ of the World.\nANSWER.\nHere the Philosopher will have the Word _Idea_ be only Understood\nfor the _Images_ of _Material_ Things represented in a _Corporeal_\nPhantasie, by which Position he may Easily Prove, that there can be no\nProper _Idea_ of an _Angel_ or _God_. Whereas as I declare every Where,\nbut especially in this Place, that I take the Name _Idea_ for whatever is\nimmediately _perceived_ by the _Mind_, so that when I _Will_, or _Fear_,\nbecause at the same time I _perceive_ that I _Will_ or _Fear_, this\nvery _Will_ or _Fear_ are reckon\u2019d by me among the number of _Ideas_;\nAnd I have purposely made use of that Word, because It was usual with\nthe Antient Philosophers to signifie the Manner of _Perceptions_ in the\n_Divine Mind_, altho neither we nor they acknowledge a Phantasie in\n_God_: and besides I had no fitter Word to express it by.\nAnd I think I have sufficiently explain\u2019d the _Idea_ of _God_ for those\nthat will attend my meaning, but I can never do it fully enough for those\nthat will Understand my Words otherwise then I intend them.\nLastly, what is here added concerning the _Creation_ of the World is\nwholly beside the Question in hand.\nOBJECT. VI.\n* _But there are Other (~Thoughts~) That have Superadded Forms to them,\nas when I Will, when I Fear, when I Affirm, when I Deny; I know I have\nalwayes (whenever I think) some certain thing as the Subject or Object\nof my Thought, but in this last sort of Thoughts there is something\nMore which I think upon then Barely the Likeness of the Thing; and of\nthese Thoughts some are called Wills and Affections, and others of them\nJudgements._\nWhen any one _Fears_ or _Wills_, he has certainly the _Image_ of the\n_Thing Fear\u2019d_, or _Action Will\u2019d_, but what more a _Willing_ or\n_Fearing_ Man has in his Thoughts is not explain\u2019d; and tho _Fear_ be a\n_Thought_, yet I see not how it can be any other then the _Thought_ of\nthe _Thing Fear\u2019d_; For what is the _Fear_ of a _Lion rushing on me_, but\nthe _Idea_ of a Lion Rushing on me, and the _Effect_ (which that _Idea_\nproduces in the _Heart_) whereby the Man _Fearing_ is excited to that\nAnimal Motion which is called Flight? but now this Motion of _Flying_\nis not _Thought_, it remains therefore that in _Fear_ there is no other\n_Thought_, but that which consists in the _likeness_ of the thing. And\nthe same may be said of _Will_.\nMoreover _Affirmation_ and _Negation_ are not without a _voice_ and\n_words_, and hence \u2019tis that Brutes can neither _affirme_ or _deny_ not\nso much as in their Thought, and consequently neither can they judge.\nBut yet the same thought may be in a beast as in a Man; for when we\n_affirme_ that a Man runs, we have not a _thought_ different from what\na Dog has when he sees his Master running; _Affirmation_ therefore or\n_Negation_ superadds nothing to _meer thoughts_, unless perhaps it adds\nthis thought, that the _names_ of which an _Affirmation_ consists are (to\nthe Person _affirming_) the _Names_ of the _same thing_; and this is not\nto comprehend in the _thought_ more then the _likeness_ of the _thing_,\nbut it is only comprehending the same _likeness twice_.\nANSWER.\n\u2019Tis self evident, That \u2019tis one thing to _see_ a Lion and at the same\ntime to _fear_ him, and an other thing _only_ to _see_ him. So \u2019tis one\nthing to _see_ a Man Running, and an other thing to _Affirme_ within my\nself (which may be done without a voice) That I _see_ him.\nBut in all this objection I find nothing that requires an Answer.\nOBJECT. VII.\n* _Now it remains for me to examine, how I have received this Idea of\nGod, for I have neither received it by means of my senses, neither comes\nit to me without my forethought, as the Ideas of sensible things use to\ndo, when those things work on the Organs of my sense, or at least seem so\nto work; Neither is this Idea framed by my self, for I can neither add\nto, nor detract from it. Wherefore I have only to conclude, that it is\ninnate, even as the Idea of me my self is Natural to my self._\nIf there be no _Idea_ of _God_, as it seems there is _not_ (and here \u2019tis\nnot proved that there is) this whole discourse falls to the ground. And\nas to the _Idea_ of _my self_ (if I respect the _Body_) it proceeds from\n_Sight_, but (if the _Soul_) there is no _Idea_ of a _Soul_, but we\ncollect by Ratiocination, that there is some inward thing in a Mans Body,\nthat imparts to it _Animal Motion_, by which it _perceives_ and _moves_,\nand this (whatever it be) without any _Idea_ we call a _Soul_.\nANSWER.\nIf there be an _Idea_ of _God_ (as \u2019tis manifest that there is) this\nwhole _Objection_ falls to the ground; and then he subjoyns, _That we\nhave no Idea of the Soul, but collect it by Ratiocination_, \u2019Tis the same\nas if he should say, that there is no _Image_ thereof represented in the\n_Phantasie_, but yet, that there is such a Thing, as I call an _Idea_.\nOBJECT. VIII.\n* _An other Idea of the Sun as taken from the Arguments of Astronomers,\nthat is consequentially collected by me from certain natural notions._\nAt the same time we can certainly have but one _Idea_ of the Sun, whether\nit be look\u2019d at by our eyes, or collected by _Ratiocination_ to be much\nbigger than it seems; for this last is not an _Idea_ of the Sun, but a\nproof by Arguments, that the _Idea_ of the _Sun_ would be much larger, if\nit were look\u2019d at nigher. But at different or several times the _Ideas_\nof the Sun may be diverse, as if at one time we look at it with our bare\neye, at an other time through a Teloscope; but Astronomical arguments do\nnot make the _Idea_ of the Sun greater or less, but they rather tell us\nthat the _sensible Idea_ thereof is _false_.\nANSWER.\nHere also (as before) what he says is not the _Idea_ of the Sun, and yet\nis described, is that very thing which I call the _Idea_.\nOBJECT. IX.\n* _For without doubt those Ideas which Represent substances are something\nmore, or (as I may say) have more of objective Reality in them, then\nthose that represent only accidents or modes; and again, that by which\nI understand a mighty God, Eternal, Infinite, Omniscient, Omnipotent,\nCreatour of all things besides himself, has certainly in it more\nobjective reality, then those by which Finite substances are exhibited._\nI have before often noted that there can be no _Idea_ of _God_ or\nthe _Mind_: I will now superadd, That neither can there be an _Idea_\nof _Substance_. For _Substance_ (Which is only _Matter Subject_ to\n_Accidents_ and _Changes_) is _Collected_ only by _Reasoning_, but\nit is not at all _Conceived_, neither does it _represent_ to us any\n_Idea_. And if this be true, How can it be said, _That those Ideas\nwhich represent to us Substances have in them something More, or More\nObjective Reality, then those which represent to us Accidents_? Besides,\nLet _Des-Cartes_ again Consider what he means by ~More Reality~? Can\n_Reality_ be increas\u2019d or diminish\u2019d? Or does he think that One _Thing_\ncan be _More A Thing_ then an other Thing? let him Consider how this can\nbe Explain\u2019d to our Understandings with that _Perspicuity_ or Clearness\nwhich is requisite in all _Demonstrations_, and Which He Himself is used\nto present us with upon other Occasions.\nANSWER.\nI have often noted before, That that very Thing which is _evidenc\u2019d_\nby _Reason_, as also whatever else is perceived by any other Means, is\nCalled by Me an _Idea_. And I have sufficiently explain\u2019d How _Reality_\nmay be _Encreas\u2019d_ or _Diminish\u2019d_, in the same manner (to wit) as\n_Substance_ is _More_ a _Thing_, then A _Mode_; and if there be any such\nthings as _Real Qualities_, or _Incomplete Substances_, these are _More\nThings_ then _Modes_, and _Less Things_ then _Complete Substances_:\nand Lastly if there be an _Infinite Independent Substance_ this is\n_More_ a _Thing_, then a _Finite, Dependent Substance_. And all this is\nself-evident.\nOBJECT. X.\n* _Wherefore There only Remains the Idea of God; Wherein I must consider\nwhether there be not something Included, which cannot Possibly have its\nOriginal from me. By the Word, God, I mean a certain Infinite Substance,\nIndependent, Omniscient, Almighty, by whom both I my self and every\nthing Else That Is (if any thing do actually exist) was Created; All\nwhich attributes are of such an High Nature That the more attentively\nI consider them, the Less I Conceive my self alone possible to be the\nAuthor of these notions; from what therefore has been said I must\nConclude there is a God._\nConsidering the _Attributes_ of _God_, that from thence we may gather an\n_Idea_ of _God_, and that we may enquire whether there be not something\nin that _Idea_ which cannot Possibly Proceed from our selves, I discover\n(if I am not Deceived) that what we think off at the _Venerable name_\nof _God_ proceeds neither from our selves, neither is it Necessary that\nthey should have any other _Original_ then from _Outward Objects_. For\nby the Name of _God_ I understand a ~Substance~, that is, I understand\nthat _God_ Exists (not by an _Idea_, but by Reasoning) ~Infinite~ (that\nis, I cannot conceive or Imagine Terms or Parts in him so Extream, but I\ncan Imagine others Farther) from whence it follows, that not an _Idea_ of\n_Gods Infinity_ but of my Own bounds and Limits presents it self at the\nWord _Infinite_. ~Independent~, That is, I do not conceive any _Cause_\nfrom which _God_ may proceed; from whence \u2019tis evident that I have no\nother _Idea_ at the word _Independent_, but the memory of my own _Ideas_\nwhich at Different Times have _Different Beginnings_, and Consequently\nthey must be _Dependent_.\nWherefore, to say that God is _Independent_, is only to say That _God_ is\nin the Number of those things, the _Original_ whereof I do not Imagine:\nand so to say that _God_ is _Infinite_, is the same as if we say That He\nis in the Number of Those Things whose _Bounds_ we do not Conceive: And\nthus any _Idea_ of _God_ is Exploded, for What _Idea_ can we have without\n_Beginning_ or _Ending_?\n~Omniscient~ or Understanding all things, Here _I_ desire to know, by\nwhat _Idea_, _Des-Cartes_ understands _Gods Understanding_? ~Almighty~,\nI desire also to know by What _Idea Gods Power_ is _understood_? For\n_Power_ is in Respect of Future Things, that is, Things not Existing. For\nmy Part, I understand _Power_ from the Image or Memory of past Actions,\narguing with my self thus, He did so, therefore he was _able_ (or had\n_Power_) to do so, therefore (continuing the same) he will again have\n_Power_ to do so. But now all these are _Ideas_ that may arise from\n_external Objects_.\n~Creatour~ of all things, _I_ can frame an _Image_ of _Creation_ from\nwhat I see every day, as a Man Born, or growing from a Punctum to that\nshape and size he now bears; an other _Idea_ then this no man can have at\nthe word _Creatour_; But the _Possibility_ of _Imagining_ a Creation is\nnot sufficient to prove that the world _was created_. And therefore tho\nit were _Demonstrated_ that some _Infinite Independent Almighty Being_\ndid _exist_, yet it will not from thence follow that a _Creatour exists_;\nunless one can think this to be a right inference, we _believe_ that\nthere exists something that has created all other things, therefore the\nworld _was Created_ thereby.\nMoreover when he says, that the _Idea_ of _God_, and of our _Soul_ is\n_Innate_ or _born in us_, I would fain know, whether the _Souls_ of those\nthat _sleep soundly_ do _think_ unless they _dream_; If not, then at that\ntime they have no _Ideas_, and consequently no _Idea_ is _Innate_, for\nwhat is _Innate_ to us is never _Absent_ from us.\nANSWER.\nNone of _Gods_ Attributes can proceed from _outward objects_ as from a\n_Pattern_, because there is nothing found in God like what is found in\n_External_, that is, _Corporeal_ things; Now \u2019tis manifest that whatever\nwe think of in him _differing_ or _unlike_ what we find in them proceeds\nnot from them, but from a cause of that very _diversity_ in our Thought.\nAnd here I desire to know, how this Philosopher deduces _Gods\nUnderstanding_ from _outward Things_, and yet I can easily explain\nwhat _Idea_ I have thereof, by saying, that by the _Idea_ of _Gods\nUnderstanding_ I conceive whatever is the _Form_ of any _Perception_;\nFor who is there that does not perceive that he _understands_\nsomething or other, and consequently he must thereby have an _Idea_ of\n_understanding_, and by enlarging it _Indefinitely_ he forms the _Idea_\nof _Gods Understanding_. And so of his other Attributes.\nAnd seeing we have made use of that _Idea_ of _God_ which is in us to\ndemonstrate his existence, and seeing there is contain\u2019d in this _Idea_\nsuch an _Immense Power_, that we conceive it a contradiction for _God_ to\n_Exist_, and yet that any thing should _Be_ besides Him, which was not\n_Created_ by Him, it plainly follows that demonstrating His existence\nwe demonstrate also that the whole world, or all things different from\n_God_, were _Created_ by God.\nLastly when we assert, that some _Ideas_ are _Innate_ or _natural_ to us,\nwe do not mean that they are always present with us (for so no _Idea_\nwould be _Innate_) but only that we have in our selves a Faculty of\nproducing them.\nOBJECT. XI.\n* _The whole stress of which Argument lyes thus; because I know it\nimpossible for me to be of the same nature I am, ~viz~, having the Idea\nof a God in me, unless really there were a God, A God (I say) that very\nsame God, whose Idea I have in my mind._\nWherefore seeing \u2019tis not _demonstrated_ that we have an _Idea_ of\n_God_, and the Christian Religion commands us to believe that _God_ is\n_Inconceivable_, that is, as I suppose, that we cannot have an _Idea_ of\nHim, it follows, that the _Existence_ of _God_ is not demonstrated, much\nless _the Creation_.\nANSWER.\nWhen _God_ is said to be _Inconceiveable_ \u2019tis understood of an _Adequate\nfull conception_. But I am \u2019een tired with often repeating, how\nnotwithstanding we may have an _Idea_ of _God_. So that here is nothing\nbrought that makes any thing against my _demonstration_.\nOBJECT. XII.\n_Against the Fourth Meditation, Of Truth and Falshood._\n* _By Which I understand that Error (as it is Error) is not a Real Being,\nDependent on God, but is only a Defect; and that therefore to make me Err\nthere is not requisite a Faculty of Erring Given me by God._\n\u2019Tis Certain that _Ignorance_ is only a _Defect_, and that there is no\nOccasion of any _Positive Faculty_ to make us _Ignorant_. But this\nposition is not so clear in Relation to _Error_, for Stones and Inanimate\nCreatures cannot _Err_, for this Reason only, because they have not the\n_Faculties_ of _Reasoning_ or _Imagination_; from whence \u2019tis Natural\nfor us to Conclude, That to _Err_ there is requisite a _Faculty_ of\n_Judging_, or at least of _Imagining_, both which _Faculties_ are\n_Positive_, and given to all _Creatures_ subject to Error, and to Them\nonly.\nMoreover _Des-Cartes_ says thus, _I find_ (my Errors) _to Depend on two\nconcurring Causes_, viz. _on my Faculty of Knowing, and on my Faculty of\nChoosing, or Freedom of my Will_. Which seems Contradictious to what he\nsaid before; And here also we may note, that _Freedom of Will_ is assumed\nwithout any Proof contrary to the Opinion of the Calvinists.\nANSWER.\nTho to make us _Err_ there is requisite a _Faculty_ of _Reasoning_ (or\nrather of _Judging_, that is, of _Affirming_ and _Denying_) because\n_Error_ is the _Defect_ thereof, yet it does not follow from thence that\nthis _Defect_ is any thing _Real_, for neither is _Blindness_ a _Real_\nThing, tho stones cannot be said to be _Blind_, for this Reason only,\nThat they are _incapable of sight_. And I much wonder that in all these\n_Objections_ I have not found one _Right Inference_.\nI have not here assumed any thing concerning the _Freedom_ of _Mans\nWill_, unless what all Men do Experience in themselves, and is most\nevident by the Light of Nature. Neither see I any Reason, Why he should\nsay that this is Contradictious to any former Position.\nPerhaps there may be Many, who respecting _Gods predisposal_ of Things\ncannot Comprehend, How their _Freedom_ of _Will_ Consists there-with,\nbut yet there is no Man who, respecting himself only, does not find by\nExperience, That \u2019tis one and the same Thing to be _Willing_, and to be\n_Free_. But \u2019tis no Place to Enquire what the Opinion of others may be in\nthis Matter.\nOBJECT. XIII.\n* _As for Example, When lately I set my self to examine Whether any\nThing Do Exist, and found, that from my setting my self to examine such a\nThing, it evidently follows, That I my self Exist, I could not but Judge,\nwhat I so clearly understood, to be true, not that I was forced thereto\nby any outward Impulse, but because a strong Propension in my Will did\nfollow this Great Light in my Understanding, so that I believed it so\nmuch the more Freely and Willingly, by how much the Less indifferent I\nwas thereunto._\nThis expression, _Great Light in the Understanding_, is _Metaphorical_,\nand therefore not to be used in Argumentation; And every one, that\nDoubts not of his Opinion, Pretends such a _Light_, and has no less a\n_Propension_ in his _Will_ to Affirm what he doubts not, than He that\n_really_ and _truely_ knows a Thing. Wherefore this _Light_ may be the\ncause of _Defending_ and _Holding_ an Opinion _Obstinately_, but never of\n_knowing_ an Opinion _Truly_.\nMoreover not only the _Knowledge_ of _Truth_, but _Belief_ or _Giving\nAssent_, are not the _Acts_ of the _Will_; for Whatever is _proved_ by\n_strong Arguments_, or _Credibly_ told, we Believe whether we will or no.\n\u2019Tis true, To _Affirm_ or _Deny_ Propositions, to _Defend_ or _Oppose_\nPropositions, are the _Acts_ of the _Will_; but it does not from thence\nFollow that the _Internal Assent_ depends on the _Will_. Wherefore the\nfollowing Conclusion (_so that in the abuse of our Freedom of Will that\nPrivation consists which Constitutes Error_) is not fully Demonstrated.\nANSWER.\n\u2019Tis not much _matter_, Whether this expression, _Great Light_, be\n_Argumentative_ or not, so it be explicative, as really it is, For all\nmen know, that by _light in the understanding_ is meant _clearness_ of\n_knowledge_, which every one has not, that _thinks_ he has; and this\nhinders not but this _light_ in the _Understanding_ may be very different\nfrom an _obstinate Opinion_ taken up without _clear perception_.\nBut when \u2019tis here said, _That we assent to things clearly perceived\nwhether we will or no_, \u2019tis the same, as if it were said, _that willing\nor nilling, we desire Good clearly known_; whereas the word _Nilling_,\nfinds no room in such Expressions, for it implies, that we will and nill\nthe same thing.\nOBJECT XIV.\n_Against the Fifth Meditation. Of the Essence of material things._\n* _As when for Example, I imagine a Triangle, tho perhaps such a Figure\nexists no where out of my thoughts, nor ever will exist, yet the Nature\nthereof is determinate, and its Essence or Form is immutable and eternal,\nwhich is neither made by me nor depends on my mind, as appears from this,\nthat many propositions may be demonstrated of this Triangle._\nIf a Triangle be _no where_, I understand not how it can have _any\nNature_, for what is _no where_, is not, and therefore has not a _Being_,\nor any _Nature_.\nA Triangle in the _Mind_ arises from a Triangle _seen_, or from one made\nup of what has been _seen_, but when once we have given the name of a\n_Triangle_ to a thing (from which we think the _Idea_ of a _Triangle_\narises) tho the Triangle it self perish, yet the _name_ continues; In\nthe like manner, when we have once conceived in our thought, _That all\nthe Angles of a Triangle are equal to two right ones_, and when we have\ngiven this other name (viz. _Having its three Angles equal to two right\nones_) to a Triangle, tho afterwards there were no such thing in the\nWorld, yet the _Name_ would still continue, and this Proposition, _A\nTriangle is a Figure having three Angles equal to two right Ones_, would\nbe _eternally true_. But the Nature of a Triangle will not be eternal if\nall Triangles were destroy\u2019d.\nThis Proposition likewise, _A Man is an Animal_, will be _true_ to\n_Eternity_, because the Word _Animal_ will eternally signifie what the\nWord _Man_ signifies; but certainly if _Mankind_ perish, _Humane Nature_\nwill be no longer.\nFrom whence \u2019tis Manifest, That _Essence_ as \u2019tis distinguish\u2019d from\n_Existence_ is nothing more than the _Copulation_ of _Names_ by this word\n_Is_, and therefore _Essence_ without _Existence_ is meerly a _Fiction_\nof our own; and as the _Image_ of a _Man_ in the _Mind_ is to a _Man_, so\nit seems _Essence_ is to _Existence_. Or as this Proposition _Socrates\nis a Man_, is to this, _Socrates Is or Exists_, so is the _Essence_ of\n_Socrates_ to his Existence. Now this Proposition, _Socrates is a Man_,\nwhen _Socrates_ does not exist, signifies only the Connection of the\nNames, and the word _Is_ carries under it the _Image_ of the _unity_ of\nthe thing, which is called by these _Two Names_.\nANSWER.\nThe Difference between _Essence_ and _Existence_ is known to all Men. And\nwhat is here said of _Eternal Names_ instead of _Eternal Truth_, has been\nlong ago sufficiently rejected.\nOBJECT. XV.\n_Against the Sixth Meditation. Of the Existence of Material Beings._\n* _And seeing God has given me no Faculty to know whether these Ideas\nproceed from Bodies or not, but rather a strong inclination to believe,\nthat these Ideas are sent from Bodies, I see no reason, why God should\nnot be counted a Deceiver, if these Ideas came from any where, but from\nCorporeal Beings, and therefore we must conclude that Corporeal Beings\nexist._\n\u2019Tis a received opinion, that Physicians who deceive their Patients for\ntheir Healths sake, and Fathers, who deceive their Children for their\nGood, are guilty thereby of no Crimes, for the _fault_ of _Deceit_ does\nnot consist in the _falsity_ of _Words_; but in the _Injury_ done to the\nPerson deceived.\nLet _D. Cartes_ therefore consider whether this Proposition, _God can\nupon no account deceive us_, Universally taken be _true_; For if it be\nnot _true_ so universally taken, that Conclusion, _Therefore Corporeal\nBeings exist_, will not follow.\nANSWER.\n\u2019Tis not requisite for the establishment of my Conclusion, _That we\ncannot be deceived on any account_ (for I willingly granted, that we\nmay be _often_ deceived) but that we cannot be deceived, when that our\n_Error_ argues that in _God_ there is such a _Will_ to _Cheat_ us as\nwould be _contradictious_ to his _Nature_. And here again we have a\n_wrong inference_ in this _Objection_.\nThe Last Objection.\n* _For now I plainly discover a great difference between them (~that is\nsleep and waking~) for my Dreams are never conjoyn\u2019d by my Memory, with\nthe other Actions of my Life._\nI desire to Know, whether it be certain, that a Man _dreaming_, that the\n_doubts_ whether he _dream or not_, may not _Dream_, that he joyns his\n_Dream_ to the _Ideas_ of things past long since; if he may, than those\n_Actions_ of his past life, may be thought as _true_ if he were awake.\nMoreover because (as _D.

D.\nLATE PROFESSOR OF LOGIC AND RHETORIC IN THE UNIVERSITY OF GLASGOW\nFrom the Publisher's Preface.\nThe present volume contains a reprint of the preface and the first\npart of the Principles of Philosophy, together with selections from\nthe second, third and fourth parts of that work, corresponding to\nthe extracts in the French edition of Gamier, are also given, as\nwell as an appendix containing part of Descartes' reply to the\nSecond Objections (viz., his formal demonstrations of the existence\nof Deity). The translation is based on the original Latin edition of\nthe Principles, published in 1644.\nThe work had been translated into French during Descartes' lifetime,\nand personally revised and corrected by him, the French text is\nevidently deserving of the same consideration as the Latin\noriginals, and consequently, the additions and variations of the\nFrench version have also been given--the additions being put in\nsquare brackets in the text and the variations in the footnotes.\nA copy of the title-page of the original edition, as given in Dr. C.\nGuttler's work (Munich: C. H. Beck. 1901), are also reproduced in\nthe present volume.\nSELECTIONS FROM THE PRINCIPLES OF PHILOSOPHY\nOF DESCARTES\nTRANSLATED FROM THE LATIN AND COLLATED WITH THE FRENCH\nLETTER OF THE AUTHOR\nTO THE FRENCH TRANSLATOR OF THE PRINCIPLES OF PHILOSOPHY SERVING FOR\nA PREFACE.\nSir,--The version of my principles which you have been at pains to\nmake, is so elegant and finished as to lead me to expect that the\nwork will be more generally read in French than in Latin, and better\nunderstood. The only apprehension I entertain is lest the title\nshould deter some who have not been brought up to letters, or with\nwhom philosophy is in bad repute, because the kind they were taught\nhas proved unsatisfactory; and this makes me think that it will be\nuseful to add a preface to it for the purpose of showing what the\nMATTER of the work is, what END I had in view in writing it, and\nwhat UTILITY may be derived from it. But although it might be my\npart to write a preface of this nature, seeing I ought to know those\nparticulars better than any other person, I cannot nevertheless\nprevail upon myself to do anything more than merely to give a\nsummary of the chief points that fall, as I think, to be discussed\nin it: and I leave it to your discretion to present to the public\nsuch part of them as you shall judge proper.\nI should have desired, in the first place, to explain in it what\nphilosophy is, by commencing with the most common matters, as, for\nexample, that the word PHILOSOPHY signifies the study of wisdom, and\nthat by wisdom is to be understood not merely prudence in the\nmanagement of affairs, but a perfect knowledge of all that man can\nknow, as well for the conduct of his life as for the preservation of\nhis health and the discovery of all the arts, and that knowledge to\nsubserve these ends must necessarily be deduced from first causes;\nso that in order to study the acquisition of it (which is properly\ncalled philosophizing), we must commence with the investigation of\nthose first causes which are called PRINCIPLES. Now these principles\nmust possess TWO CONDITIONS: in the first place, they must be so\nclear and evident that the human mind, when it attentively considers\nthem, cannot doubt of their truth; in the second place, the\nknowledge of other things must be so dependent on them as that\nthough the principles themselves may indeed be known apart from what\ndepends on them, the latter cannot nevertheless be known apart from\nthe former. It will accordingly be necessary thereafter to endeavour\nso to deduce from those principles the knowledge of the things that\ndepend on them, as that there may be nothing in the whole series of\ndeductions which is not perfectly manifest. God is in truth the only\nbeing who is absolutely wise, that is, who possesses a perfect\nknowledge of all things; but we may say that men are more or less\nwise as their knowledge of the most important truths is greater or\nless. And I am confident that there is nothing, in what I have now\nsaid, in which all the learned do not concur.\nI should, in the next place, have proposed to consider the utility\nof philosophy, and at the same time have shown that, since it\nembraces all that the human mind can know, we ought to believe that\nit is by it we are distinguished from savages and barbarians, and\nthat the civilisation and culture of a nation is regulated by the\ndegree in which true philosophy nourishes in it, and, accordingly,\nthat to contain true philosophers is the highest privilege a state\ncan enjoy. Besides this, I should have shown that, as regards\nindividuals, it is not only useful for each man to have intercourse\nwith those who apply themselves to this study, but that it is\nincomparably better he should himself direct his attention to it;\njust as it is doubtless to be preferred that a man should make use\nof his own eyes to direct his steps, and enjoy by means of the same\nthe beauties of colour and light, than that he should blindly follow\nthe guidance of another; though the latter course is certainly\nbetter than to have the eyes closed with no guide except one's self.\nBut to live without philosophizing is in truth the same as keeping\nthe eyes closed without attempting to open them; and the pleasure of\nseeing all that sight discloses is not to be compared with the\nsatisfaction afforded by the discoveries of philosophy. And,\nfinally, this study is more imperatively requisite for the\nregulation of our manners, and for conducting us through life, than\nis the use of our eyes for directing our steps. The brutes, which\nhave only their bodies to conserve, are continually occupied in\nseeking sources of nourishment; but men, of whom the chief part is\nthe mind, ought to make the search after wisdom their principal\ncare, for wisdom is the true nourishment of the mind; and I feel\nassured, moreover, that there are very many who would not fail in\nthe search, if they would but hope for success in it, and knew the\ndegree of their capabilities for it. There is no mind, how ignoble\nsoever it be, which remains so firmly bound up in the objects of the\nsenses, as not sometime or other to turn itself away from them in\nthe aspiration after some higher good, although not knowing\nfrequently wherein that good consists. The greatest favourites of\nfortune--those who have health, honours, and riches in abundance--\nare not more exempt from aspirations of this nature than others;\nnay, I am persuaded that these are the persons who sigh the most\ndeeply after another good greater and more perfect still than any\nthey already possess. But the supreme good, considered by natural\nreason without the light of faith, is nothing more than the\nknowledge of truth through its first causes, in other words, the\nwisdom of which philosophy is the study. And, as all these\nparticulars are indisputably true, all that is required to gain\nassent to their truth is that they be well stated.\nBut as one is restrained from assenting to these doctrines by\nexperience, which shows that they who make pretensions to philosophy\nare often less wise and reasonable than others who never applied\nthemselves to the study, I should have here shortly explained\nwherein consists all the science we now possess, and what are the\ndegrees of wisdom at which we have arrived. The first degree\ncontains only notions so clear of themselves that they can be\nacquired without meditation; the second comprehends all that the\nexperience of the senses dictates; the third, that which the\nconversation of other men teaches us; to which may be added as the\nfourth, the reading, not of all books, but especially of such as\nhave been written by persons capable of conveying proper\ninstruction, for it is a species of conversation we hold with their\nauthors. And it seems to me that all the wisdom we in ordinary\npossess is acquired only in these four ways; for I do not class\ndivine revelation among them, because it does not conduct us by\ndegrees, but elevates us at once to an infallible faith.\nThere have been, indeed, in all ages great minds who endeavoured to\nfind a fifth road to wisdom, incomparably more sure and elevated\nthan the other four. The path they essayed was the search of first\ncauses and true principles, from which might be deduced the reasons\nof all that can be known by man; and it is to them the appellation\nof philosophers has been more especially accorded. I am not aware\nthat there is any one of them up to the present who has succeeded in\nthis enterprise. The first and chief whose writings we possess are\nPlato and Aristotle, between whom there was no difference, except\nthat the former, following in the footsteps of his master, Socrates,\ningenuously confessed that he had never yet been able to find\nanything certain, and that he was contented to write what seemed to\nhim probable, imagining, for this end, certain principles by which\nhe endeavoured to account for the other things. Aristotle, on the\nother hand, characterised by less candour, although for twenty years\nthe disciple of Plato, and with no principles beyond those of his\nmaster, completely reversed his mode of putting them, and proposed\nas true and certain what it is probable he himself never esteemed as\nsuch. But these two men had acquired much judgment and wisdom by the\nfour preceding means, qualities which raised their authority very\nhigh, so much so that those who succeeded them were willing rather\nto acquiesce in their opinions, than to seek better for themselves.\nThe chief question among their disciples, however, was as to whether\nwe ought to doubt of all things or hold some as certain,--a dispute\nwhich led them on both sides into extravagant errors; for a part of\nthose who were for doubt, extended it even to the actions of life,\nto the neglect of the most ordinary rules required for its conduct;\nthose, on the other hand, who maintained the doctrine of certainty,\nsupposing that it must depend upon the senses, trusted entirely to\nthem. To such an extent was this carried by Epicurus, that it is\nsaid he ventured to affirm, contrary to all the reasonings of the\nastronomers, that the sun is no larger than it appears.\nIt is a fault we may remark in most disputes, that, as truth is the\nmean between the two opinions that are upheld, each disputant\ndeparts from it in proportion to the degree in which he possesses\nthe spirit of contradiction. But the error of those who leant too\nmuch to the side of doubt, was not followed for any length of time,\nand that of the opposite party has been to some extent corrected by\nthe doctrine that the senses are deceitful in many instances.\nNevertheless, I do not know that this error was wholly removed by\nshowing that certitude is not in the senses, but in the\nunderstanding alone when it has clear perceptions; and that while we\nonly possess the knowledge which is acquired in the first four\ngrades of wisdom, we ought not to doubt of the things that appear to\nbe true in what regards the conduct of life, nor esteem them as so\ncertain that we cannot change our opinions regarding them, even\nthough constrained by the evidence of reason.\nFrom ignorance of this truth, or, if there was any one to whom it\nwas known, from neglect of it, the majority of those who in these\nlater ages aspired to be philosophers, blindly followed Aristotle,\nso that they frequently corrupted the sense of his writings, and\nattributed to him various opinions which he would not recognise as\nhis own were he now to return to the world; and those who did not\nfollow him, among whom are to be found many of the greatest minds,\ndid yet not escape being imbued with his opinions in their youth, as\nthese form the staple of instruction in the schools; and thus their\nminds were so preoccupied that they could not rise to the knowledge\nof true principles. And though I hold all the philosophers in\nesteem, and am unwilling to incur odium by my censure, I can adduce\na proof of my assertion, which I do not think any of them will\ngainsay, which is, that they all laid down as a principle what they\ndid not perfectly know. For example, I know none of them who did not\nsuppose that there was gravity in terrestrial bodies; but although\nexperience shows us very clearly that bodies we call heavy descend\ntowards the center of the earth, we do not, therefore, know the\nnature of gravity, that is, the cause or principle in virtue of\nwhich bodies descend, and we must derive our knowledge of it from\nsome other source. The same may be said of a vacuum and atoms, of\nheat and cold, of dryness and humidity, and of salt, sulphur, and\nmercury, and the other things of this sort which some have adopted\nas their principles. But no conclusion deduced from a principle\nwhich is not clear can be evident, even although the deduction be\nformally valid; and hence it follows that no reasonings based on\nsuch principles could lead them to the certain knowledge of any one\nthing, nor consequently advance them one step in the search after\nwisdom. And if they did discover any truth, this was due to one or\nother of the four means above mentioned. Notwithstanding this, I am\nin no degree desirous to lessen the honour which each of them can\njustly claim; I am only constrained to say, for the consolation of\nthose who have not given their attention to study, that just as in\ntravelling, when we turn our back upon the place to which we were\ngoing, we recede the farther from it in proportion as we proceed in\nthe new direction for a greater length of time and with greater\nspeed, so that, though we may be afterwards brought back to the\nright way, we cannot nevertheless arrive at the destined place as\nsoon as if we had not moved backwards at all; so in philosophy, when\nwe make use of false principles, we depart the farther from the\nknowledge of truth and wisdom exactly in proportion to the care with\nwhich we cultivate them, and apply ourselves to the deduction of\ndiverse consequences from them, thinking that we are philosophizing\nwell, while we are only departing the farther from the truth; from\nwhich it must be inferred that they who have learned the least of\nall that has been hitherto distinguished by the name of philosophy\nare the most fitted for the apprehension of truth.\nAfter making those matters clear, I should, in the next place, have\ndesired to set forth the grounds for holding that the true\nprinciples by which we may reach that highest degree of wisdom\nwherein consists the sovereign good of human life, are those I have\nproposed in this work; and two considerations alone are sufficient\nto establish this--the first of which is, that these principles are\nvery clear, and the second, that we can deduce all other truths from\nthem; for it is only these two conditions that are required in true\nprinciples. But I easily prove that they are very clear; firstly, by\na reference to the manner in which I found them, namely, by\nrejecting all propositions that were in the least doubtful, for it\nis certain that such as could not be rejected by this test when they\nwere attentively considered, are the most evident and clear which\nthe human mind can know. Thus by considering that he who strives to\ndoubt of all is unable nevertheless to doubt that he is while he\ndoubts, and that what reasons thus, in not being able to doubt of\nitself and doubting nevertheless of everything else, is not that\nwhich we call our body, but what we name our mind or thought, I have\ntaken the existence of this thought for the first principle, from\nwhich I very clearly deduced the following truths, namely, that\nthere is a God who is the author of all that is in the world, and\nwho, being the source of all truth, cannot have created our\nunderstanding of such a nature as to be deceived in the judgments it\nforms of the things of which it possesses a very clear and distinct\nperception. Those are all the principles of which I avail myself\ntouching immaterial or metaphysical objects, from which I most\nclearly deduce these other principles of physical or corporeal\nthings, namely, that there are bodies extended in length, breadth,\nand depth, which are of diverse figures and are moved in a variety\nof ways. Such are in sum the principles from which I deduce all\nother truths. The second circumstance that proves the clearness of\nthese principles is, that they have been known in all ages, and even\nreceived as true and indubitable by all men, with the exception only\nof the existence of God, which has been doubted by some, because\nthey attributed too much to the perceptions of the senses, and God\ncan neither be seen nor touched.\nBut, though all the truths which I class among my principles were\nknown at all times, and by all men, nevertheless, there has been no\none up to the present, who, so far as I know, has adopted them as\nprinciples of philosophy: in other words, as such that we can deduce\nfrom them the knowledge of whatever else is in the world. It\naccordingly now remains for me to prove that they are such; and it\nappears to me that I cannot better establish this than by the test\nof experience: in other words, by inviting readers to peruse the\nfollowing work. For, though I have not treated in it of all matters-\n-that being impossible--I think I have so explained all of which I\nhad occasion to treat, that they who read it attentively will have\nground for the persuasion that it is unnecessary to seek for any\nother principles than those I have given, in order to arrive at the\nmost exalted knowledge of which the mind of man is capable;\nespecially if, after the perusal of my writings, they take the\ntrouble to consider how many diverse questions are therein discussed\nand explained, and, referring to the writings of others, they see\nhow little probability there is in the reasons that are adduced in\nexplanation of the same questions by principles different from mine.\nAnd that they may the more easily undertake this, I might have said\nthat those imbued with my doctrines have much less difficulty in\ncomprehending the writings of others, and estimating their true\nvalue, than those who have not been so imbued; and this is precisely\nthe opposite of what I before said of such as commenced with the\nancient philosophy, namely, that the more they have studied it the\nless fit are they for rightly apprehending the truth.\nI should also have added a word of advice regarding the manner of\nreading this work, which is, that I should wish the reader at first\nto go over the whole of it, as he would a romance, without greatly\nstraining his attention, or tarrying at the difficulties he may\nperhaps meet with in it, with the view simply of knowing in general\nthe matters of which I treat; and that afterwards, if they seem to\nhim to merit a more careful examination, and he feel a desire to\nknow their causes, he may read it a second time, in order to observe\nthe connection of my reasonings; but that he must not then give it\nup in despair, although he may not everywhere sufficiently discover\nthe connection of the proof, or understand all the reasonings--it\nbeing only necessary to mark with a pen the places where the\ndifficulties occur, and continue to read without interruption to the\nend; then, if he does not grudge to take up the book a third time, I\nam confident he will find in a fresh perusal the solution of most of\nthe difficulties he will have marked before; and that, if any still\nremain, their solution will in the end be found in another reading.\nI have observed, on examining the natural constitutions of different\nminds, that there are hardly any so dull or slow of understanding as\nto be incapable of apprehending good opinions, or even of acquiring\nall the highest sciences, if they be but conducted along the right\nroad. And this can also be proved by reason; for, as the principles\nare clear, and as nothing ought to be deduced from them, unless most\nmanifest inferences, no one is so devoid of intelligence as to be\nunable to comprehend the conclusions that flow from them. But,\nbesides the entanglement of prejudices, from which no one is\nentirely exempt, although it is they who have been the most ardent\nstudents of the false sciences that receive the greatest detriment\nfrom them, it happens very generally that people of ordinary\ncapacity neglect to study from a conviction that they want ability,\nand that others, who are more ardent, press on too rapidly: whence\nit comes to pass that they frequently admit principles far from\nevident, and draw doubtful inferences from them. For this reason, I\nshould wish to assure those who are too distrustful of their own\nability that there is nothing in my writings which they may not\nentirely understand, if they only take the trouble to examine them;\nand I should wish, at the same time, to warn those of an opposite\ntendency that even the most superior minds will have need of much\ntime and attention to remark all I designed to embrace therein.\nAfter this, that I might lead men to understand the real design I\nhad in publishing them, I should have wished here to explain the\norder which it seems to me one ought to follow with the view of\ninstructing himself. In the first place, a man who has merely the\nvulgar and imperfect knowledge which can be acquired by the four\nmeans above explained, ought, before all else, to endeavour to form\nfor himself a code of morals, sufficient to regulate the actions of\nhis life, as well for the reason that this does not admit of delay\nas because it ought to be our first care to live well. In the next\nplace, he ought to study Logic, not that of the schools, for it is\nonly, properly speaking, a dialectic which teaches the mode of\nexpounding to others what we already know, or even of speaking much,\nwithout judgment, of what we do not know, by which means it corrupts\nrather than increases good sense--but the logic which teaches the\nright conduct of the reason with the view of discovering the truths\nof which we are ignorant; and, because it greatly depends on usage,\nit is desirable he should exercise himself for a length of time in\npractising its rules on easy and simple questions, as those of the\nmathematics. Then, when he has acquired some skill in discovering\nthe truth in these questions, he should commence to apply himself in\nearnest to true philosophy, of which the first part is Metaphysics,\ncontaining the principles of knowledge, among which is the\nexplication of the principal attributes of God, of the immateriality\nof the soul, and of all the clear and simple notions that are in us;\nthe second is Physics, in which, after finding the true principles\nof material things, we examine, in general, how the whole universe\nhas been framed; in the next place, we consider, in particular, the\nnature of the earth, and of all the bodies that are most generally\nfound upon it, as air, water, fire, the loadstone and other\nminerals. In the next place it is necessary also to examine singly\nthe nature of plants, of animals, and above all of man, in order\nthat we may thereafter be able to discover the other sciences that\nare useful to us. Thus, all Philosophy is like a tree, of which\nMetaphysics is the root, Physics the trunk, and all the other\nsciences the branches that grow out of this trunk, which are reduced\nto three principal, namely, Medicine, Mechanics, and Ethics. By the\nscience of Morals, I understand the highest and most perfect which,\npresupposing an entire knowledge of the other sciences, is the last\ndegree of wisdom.\nBut as it is not from the roots or the trunks of trees that we\ngather the fruit, but only from the extremities of their branches,\nso the principal utility of philosophy depends on the separate uses\nof its parts, which we can only learn last of all. But, though I am\nignorant of almost all these, the zeal I have always felt in\nendeavouring to be of service to the public, was the reason why I\npublished, some ten or twelve years ago, certain Essays on the\ndoctrines I thought I had acquired. The first part of these Essays\nwas a \"Discourse on the Method of rightly conducting the Reason, and\nseeking Truth in the Sciences,\" in which I gave a summary of the\nprincipal rules of logic, and also of an imperfect ethic, which a\nperson may follow provisionally so long as he does not know any\nbetter. The other parts were three treatises: the first of\nDioptrics, the second of Meteors, and the third of Geometry. In the\nDioptrics, I designed to show that we might proceed far enough in\nphilosophy as to arrive, by its means, at the knowledge of the arts\nthat are useful to life, because the invention of the telescope, of\nwhich I there gave an explanation, is one of the most difficult that\nhas ever been made. In the treatise of Meteors, I desired to exhibit\nthe difference that subsists between the philosophy I cultivate and\nthat taught in the schools, in which the same matters are usually\ndiscussed. In fine, in the Geometry, I professed to demonstrate that\nI had discovered many things that were before unknown, and thus\nafford ground for believing that we may still discover many others,\nwith the view of thus stimulating all to the investigation of truth.\nSince that period, anticipating the difficulty which many would\nexperience in apprehending the foundations of the Metaphysics, I\nendeavoured to explain the chief points of them in a book of\nMeditations, which is not in itself large, but the size of which has\nbeen increased, and the matter greatly illustrated, by the\nObjections which several very learned persons sent to me on occasion\nof it, and by the Replies which I made to them. At length, after it\nappeared to me that those preceding treatises had sufficiently\nprepared the minds of my readers for the Principles of Philosophy, I\nalso published it; and I have divided this work into four parts, the\nfirst of which contains the principles of human knowledge, and which\nmay be called the First Philosophy, or Metaphysics. That this part,\naccordingly, may be properly understood, it will be necessary to\nread beforehand the book of Meditations I wrote on the same subject.\nThe other three parts contain all that is most general in Physics,\nnamely, the explication of the first laws or principles of nature,\nand the way in which the heavens, the fixed stars, the planets,\ncomets, and generally the whole universe, were composed; in the next\nplace, the explication, in particular, of the nature of this earth,\nthe air, water, fire, the magnet, which are the bodies we most\ncommonly find everywhere around it, and of all the qualities we\nobserve in these bodies, as light, heat, gravity, and the like. In\nthis way, it seems to me, I have commenced the orderly explanation\nof the whole of philosophy, without omitting any of the matters that\nought to precede the last which I discussed. But to bring this\nundertaking to its conclusion, I ought hereafter to explain, in the\nsame manner, the nature of the other more particular bodies that are\non the earth, namely, minerals, plants, animals, and especially man;\nfinally, to treat thereafter with accuracy of Medicine, Ethics, and\nMechanics. I should require to do this in order to give to the world\na complete body of philosophy; and I do not yet feel myself so old,-\n-I do not so much distrust my strength, nor do I find myself so far\nremoved from the knowledge of what remains, as that I should not\ndare to undertake to complete this design, provided I were in a\nposition to make all the experiments which I should require for the\nbasis and verification of my reasonings. But seeing that would\ndemand a great expenditure, to which the resources of a private\nindividual like myself would not be adequate, unless aided by the\npublic, and as I have no ground to expect this aid, I believe that I\nought for the future to content myself with studying for my own\ninstruction, and posterity will excuse me if I fail hereafter to\nlabour for them.\nMeanwhile, that it may be seen wherein I think I have already\npromoted the general good, I will here mention the fruits that may\nbe gathered from my Principles. The first is the satisfaction which\nthe mind will experience on finding in the work many truths before\nunknown; for although frequently truth does not so greatly affect\nour imagination as falsity and fiction, because it seems less\nwonderful and is more simple, yet the gratification it affords is\nalways more durable and solid. The second fruit is, that in studying\nthese principles we will become accustomed by degrees to judge\nbetter of all the things we come in contact with, and thus be made\nwiser, in which respect the effect will be quite the opposite of the\ncommon philosophy, for we may easily remark in those we call pedants\nthat it renders them less capable of rightly exercising their reason\nthan they would have been if they had never known it. The third is,\nthat the truths which they contain, being highly clear and certain,\nwill take away all ground of dispute, and thus dispose men's minds\nto gentleness and concord; whereas the contrary is the effect of the\ncontroversies of the schools, which, as they insensibly render those\nwho are exercised in them more wrangling and opinionative, are\nperhaps the prime cause of the heresies and dissensions that now\nharass the world. The last and chief fruit of these Principles is,\nthat one will be able, by cultivating them, to discover many truths\nI myself have not unfolded, and thus passing by degrees from one to\nanother, to acquire in course of time a perfect knowledge of the\nwhole of philosophy, and to rise to the highest degree of wisdom.\nFor just as all the arts, though in their beginnings they are rude\nand imperfect, are yet gradually perfected by practice, from their\ncontaining at first something true, and whose effect experience\nevinces; so in philosophy, when we have true principles, we cannot\nfail by following them to meet sometimes with other truths; and we\ncould not better prove the falsity of those of Aristotle, than by\nsaying that men made no progress in knowledge by their means during\nthe many ages they prosecuted them.\nI well know that there are some men so precipitate and accustomed to\nuse so little circumspection in what they do, that, even with the\nmost solid foundations, they could not rear a firm superstructure;\nand as it is usually those who are the readiest to make books, they\nwould in a short time mar all that I have done, and introduce\nuncertainty and doubt into my manner of philosophizing, from which I\nhave carefully endeavoured to banish them, if people were to receive\ntheir writings as mine, or as representing my opinions. I had, not\nlong ago, some experience of this in one of those who were believed\ndesirous of following me the most closely, [Footnote: Regius; see La\nVie de M. Descartes, reduite en abrege (Baillet). Liv. vii., chap.\nvii.--T.] and one too of whom I had somewhere said that I had such\nconfidence in his genius as to believe that he adhered to no\nopinions which I should not be ready to avow as mine; for he last\nyear published a book entitled \"Fundamental Physics,\" in which,\nalthough he seems to have written nothing on the subject of Physics\nand Medicine which he did not take from my writings, as well from\nthose I have published as from another still imperfect on the nature\nof animals, which fell into his hands; nevertheless, because he has\ncopied them badly, and changed the order, and denied certain\nmetaphysical truths upon which all Physics ought to be based, I am\nobliged wholly to disavow his work, and here to request readers not\nto attribute to me any opinion unless they find it expressly stated\nin my own writings, and to receive no opinion as true, whether in my\nwritings or elsewhere, unless they see that it is very clearly\ndeduced from true principles. I well know, likewise, that many ages\nmay elapse ere all the truths deducible from these principles are\nevolved out of them, as well because the greater number of such as\nremain to be discovered depend on certain particular experiments\nthat never occur by chance, but which require to be investigated\nwith care and expense by men of the highest intelligence, as because\nit will hardly happen that the same persons who have the sagacity to\nmake a right use of them, will possess also the means of making\nthem, and also because the majority of the best minds have formed so\nlow an estimate of philosophy in general, from the imperfections\nthey have remarked in the kind in vogue up to the present time, that\nthey cannot apply themselves to the search after truth.\nBut, in conclusion, if the difference discernible between the\nprinciples in question and those of every other system, and the\ngreat array of truths deducible from them, lead them to discern the\nimportance of continuing the search after these truths, and to\nobserve the degree of wisdom, the perfection and felicity of life,\nto which they are fitted to conduct us, I venture to believe that\nthere will not be found one who is not ready to labour hard in so\nprofitable a study, or at least to favour and aid with all his might\nthose who shall devote themselves to it with success.\nThe height of my wishes is, that posterity may sometime behold the\nhappy issue of it, etc.\nTO THE MOST SERENE PRINCESS,\nELIZABETH, ELDEST DAUGHTER OF FREDERICK, KING OF BOHEMIA, COUNT\nPALATINE, AND ELECTOR OF THE SACRED ROMAN EMPIRE.\nMADAM,--The greatest advantage I have derived from the writings\nwhich I have already published, has arisen from my having, through\nmeans of them, become known to your Highness, and thus been\nprivileged to hold occasional converse with one in whom so many rare\nand estimable qualities are united, as to lead me to believe I\nshould do service to the public by proposing them as an example to\nposterity. It would ill become me to flatter, or to give expression\nto anything of which I had no certain knowledge, especially in the\nfirst pages of a work in which I aim at laying down the principles\nof truth. And the generous modesty that is conspicuous in all your\nactions, assures me that the frank and simple judgment of a man who\nonly writes what he believes will be more agreeable to you than the\nornate laudations of those who have studied the art of compliment.\nFor this reason, I will give insertion to nothing in this letter for\nwhich I have not the certainty both of experience and reason; and in\nthe exordium, as in the rest of the work, I will write only as\nbecomes a philosopher. There is a vast difference between real and\napparent virtues; and there is also a great discrepancy between\nthose real virtues that proceed from an accurate knowledge of the\ntruth, and such as are accompanied with ignorance or error. The\nvirtues I call apparent are only, properly speaking, vices, which,\nas they are less frequent than the vices that are opposed to them,\nand are farther removed from them than the intermediate virtues, are\nusually held in higher esteem than those virtues. Thus, because\nthose who fear dangers too much are more numerous than they who fear\nthem too little, temerity is frequently opposed to the vice of\ntimidity, and taken for a virtue, and is commonly more highly\nesteemed than true fortitude. Thus, also, the prodigal are in\nordinary more praised than the liberal; and none more easily acquire\na great reputation for piety than the superstitious and\nhypocritical. With regard to true virtues, these do not all proceed\nfrom true knowledge, for there are some that likewise spring from\ndefect or error; thus, simplicity is frequently the source of\ngoodness, fear of devotion, and despair of courage. The virtues that\nare thus accompanied with some imperfections differ from each other,\nand have received diverse appellations. But those pure and perfect\nvirtues that arise from the knowledge of good alone are all of the\nsame nature, and may be comprised under the single term wisdom. For,\nwhoever owns the firm and constant resolution of always using his\nreason as well as lies in his power, and in all his actions of doing\nwhat he judges to be best, is truly wise, as far as his nature\npermits; and by this alone he is just, courageous, temperate, and\npossesses all the other virtues, but so well balanced as that none\nof them appears more prominent than another: and for this reason,\nalthough they are much more perfect than the virtues that blaze\nforth through the mixture of some defect, yet, because the crowd\nthus observes them less, they are not usually extolled so highly.\nBesides, of the two things that are requisite for the wisdom thus\ndescribed, namely, the perception of the understanding and the\ndisposition of the will, it is only that which lies in the will\nwhich all men can possess equally, inasmuch as the understanding of\nsome is inferior to that of others. But although those who have only\nan inferior understanding may be as perfectly wise as their nature\npermits, and may render themselves highly acceptable to God by their\nvirtue, provided they preserve always a firm and constant resolution\nto do all that they shall judge to be right, and to omit nothing\nthat may lead them to the knowledge of the duties of which they are\nignorant; nevertheless, those who preserve a constant resolution of\nperforming the right, and are especially careful in instructing\nthemselves, and who possess also a highly perspicacious intellect,\narrive doubtless at a higher degree of wisdom than others; and I see\nthat these three particulars are found in great perfection in your\nHighness. For, in the first place, your desire of self-instruction\nis manifest, from the circumstance that neither the amusements of\nthe court, nor the accustomed mode of educating ladies, which\nordinarily condemns them to ignorance, have been sufficient to\nprevent you from studying with much care all that is best in the\narts and sciences; and the incomparable perspicacity of your\nintellect is evinced by this, that you penetrated the secrets of the\nsciences and acquired an accurate knowledge of them in a very short\nperiod. But of the vigour of your intellect I have a still stronger\nproof, and one peculiar to myself, in that I have never yet met any\none who understood so generally and so well as yourself all that is\ncontained in my writings. For there are several, even among men of\nthe highest intellect and learning, who find them very obscure. And\nI remark, in almost all those who are versant in Metaphysics, that\nthey are wholly disinclined from Geometry; and, on the other hand,\nthat the cultivators of Geometry have no ability for the\ninvestigations of the First Philosophy: insomuch that I can say with\ntruth I know but one mind, and that is your own, to which both\nstudies are alike congenial, and which I therefore, with propriety,\ndesignate incomparable. But what most of all enhances my admiration\nis, that so accurate and varied an acquaintance with the whole\ncircle of the sciences is not found in some aged doctor who has\nemployed many years in contemplation, but in a Princess still young,\nand whose countenance and years would more fitly represent one of\nthe Graces than a Muse or the sage Minerva. In conclusion, I not\nonly remark in your Highness all that is requisite on the part of\nthe mind to perfect and sublime wisdom, but also all that can be\nrequired on the part of the will or the manners, in which benignity\nand gentleness are so conjoined with majesty that, though fortune\nhas attacked you with continued injustice, it has failed either to\nirritate or crush you. And this constrains me to such veneration\nthat I not only think this work due to you, since it treats of\nphilosophy which is the study of wisdom, but likewise feel not more\nzeal for my reputation as a philosopher than pleasure in subscribing\nmyself,--\nOf your most Serene Highness, The most devoted servant,\nDESCARTES.\nPART I.\nOF THE PRINCIPLES OF HUMAN KNOWLEDGE.\nI. THAT in order to seek truth, it is necessary once in the course\nof our life, to doubt, as far as possible, of all things.\nAs we were at one time children, and as we formed various judgments\nregarding the objects presented to our senses, when as yet we had\nnot the entire use of our reason, numerous prejudices stand in the\nway of our arriving at the knowledge of truth; and of these it seems\nimpossible for us to rid ourselves, unless we undertake, once in our\nlifetime, to doubt of all those things in which we may discover even\nthe smallest suspicion of uncertainty.\nII. That we ought also to consider as false all that is doubtful.\nMoreover, it will be useful likewise to esteem as false the things\nof which we shall be able to doubt, that we may with greater\nclearness discover what possesses most certainty and is the easiest\nto know.\nIII. That we ought not meanwhile to make use of doubt in the\nconduct of life.\nIn the meantime, it is to be observed that we are to avail ourselves\nof this general doubt only while engaged in the contemplation of\ntruth. For, as far as concerns the conduct of life, we are very\nfrequently obliged to follow opinions merely probable, or even\nsometimes, though of two courses of action we may not perceive more\nprobability in the one than in the other, to choose one or other,\nseeing the opportunity of acting would not unfrequently pass away\nbefore we could free ourselves from our doubts.\nIV. Why we may doubt of sensible things.\nAccordingly, since we now only design to apply ourselves to the\ninvestigation of truth, we will doubt, first, whether of all the\nthings that have ever fallen under our senses, or which we have ever\nimagined, any one really exist; in the first place, because we know\nby experience that the senses sometimes err, and it would be\nimprudent to trust too much to what has even once deceived us;\nsecondly, because in dreams we perpetually seem to perceive or\nimagine innumerable objects which have no existence. And to one who\nhas thus resolved upon a general doubt, there appear no marks by\nwhich he can with certainty distinguish sleep from the waking state.\nV. Why we may also doubt of mathematical demonstrations.\nWe will also doubt of the other things we have before held as most\ncertain, even of the demonstrations of mathematics, and of their\nprinciples which we have hitherto deemed self-evident; in the first\nplace, because we have sometimes seen men fall into error in such\nmatters, and admit as absolutely certain and self evident what to us\nappeared false, but chiefly because we have learnt that God who\ncreated us is all-powerful; for we do not yet know whether perhaps\nit was his will to create us so that we are always deceived, even in\nthe things we think we know best: since this does not appear more\nimpossible than our being occasionally deceived, which, however, as\nobservation teaches us, is the case. And if we suppose that an all-\npowerful God is not the author of our being, and that we exist of\nourselves or by some other means, still, the less powerful we\nsuppose our author to be, the greater reason will we have for\nbelieving that we are not so perfect as that we may not be\ncontinually deceived.\nVI. That we possess a free-will, by which we can withhold our\nassent from what is doubtful, and thus avoid error.\nBut meanwhile, whoever in the end may be the author of our being,\nand however powerful and deceitful he may be, we are nevertheless\nconscious of a freedom, by which we can refrain from admitting to a\nplace in our belief aught that is not manifestly certain and\nundoubted, and thus guard against ever being deceived.\nVII. That we cannot doubt of our existence while we doubt, and that\nthis is the first knowledge we acquire when we philosophize in\norder.\nWhile we thus reject all of which we can entertain the smallest\ndoubt, and even imagine that it is false, we easily indeed suppose\nthat there is neither God, nor sky, nor bodies, and that we\nourselves even have neither hands nor feet, nor, finally, a body;\nbut we cannot in the same way suppose that we are not while we doubt\nof the truth of these things; for there is a repugnance in\nconceiving that what thinks does not exist at the very time when it\nthinks. Accordingly, the knowledge, _I_ THINK, THEREFORE _I_ AM, is\nthe first and most certain that occurs to one who philosophizes\norderly.\nVIII. That we hence discover the distinction between the mind and\nthe body, or between a thinking and corporeal thing.\nAnd this is the best mode of discovering the nature of the mind, and\nits distinctness from the body: for examining what we are, while\nsupposing, as we now do, that there is nothing really existing apart\nfrom our thought, we clearly perceive that neither extension, nor\nfigure, nor local motion,[Footnote: Instead of \"local motion,\" the\nFrench has \"existence in any place.\"] nor anything similar that can\nbe attributed to body, pertains to our nature, and nothing save\nthought alone; and, consequently, that the notion we have of our\nmind precedes that of any corporeal thing, and is more certain,\nseeing we still doubt whether there is any body in existence, while\nwe already perceive that we think.\nIX. What thought (COGITATIO) is.\nBy the word thought, I understand all that which so takes place in\nus that we of ourselves are immediately conscious of it; and,\naccordingly, not only to understand (INTELLIGERE, ENTENDRE), to will\n(VELLE), to imagine (IMAGINARI), but even to perceive (SENTIRE,\nSENTIR), are here the same as to think (COGITARE, PENSER). For if I\nsay, I see, or, I walk, therefore I am; and if I understand by\nvision or walking the act of my eyes or of my limbs, which is the\nwork of the body, the conclusion is not absolutely certain, because,\nas is often the case in dreams, I may think that I see or walk,\nalthough I do not open my eyes or move from my place, and even,\nperhaps, although I have no body: but, if I mean the sensation\nitself, or consciousness of seeing or walking, the knowledge is\nmanifestly certain, because it is then referred to the mind, which\nalone perceives or is conscious that it sees or walks. [Footnote: In\nthe French, \"which alone has the power of perceiving, or of being\nconscious in any other way whatever.\"]\nX. That the notions which are simplest and self-evident, are\nobscured by logical definitions; and that such are not to be\nreckoned among the cognitions acquired by study, [but as born with\nus].\nI do not here explain several other terms which I have used, or\ndesign to use in the sequel, because their meaning seems to me\nsufficiently self-evident. And I frequently remarked that\nphilosophers erred in attempting to explain, by logical definitions,\nsuch truths as are most simple and self-evident; for they thus only\nrendered them more obscure. And when I said that the proposition,\n_I_ THINK, THEREFORE _I_ AM, is of all others the first and most\ncertain which occurs to one philosophizing orderly, I did not\ntherefore deny that it was necessary to know what thought,\nexistence, and certitude are, and the truth that, in order to think\nit is necessary to be, and the like; but, because these are the most\nsimple notions, and such as of themselves afford the knowledge of\nnothing existing, I did not judge it proper there to enumerate them.\nXI. How we can know our mind more clearly than our body.\nBut now that it may be discerned how the knowledge we have of the\nmind not only precedes, and has greater certainty, but is even\nclearer, than that we have of the body, it must be remarked, as a\nmatter that is highly manifest by the natural light, that to nothing\nno affections or qualities belong; and, accordingly, that where we\nobserve certain affections, there a thing or substance to which\nthese pertain, is necessarily found. The same light also shows us\nthat we know a thing or substance more clearly in proportion as we\ndiscover in it a greater number of qualities. Now, it is manifest\nthat we remark a greater number of qualities in our mind than in any\nother thing; for there is no occasion on which we know anything\nwhatever when we are not at the same time led with much greater\ncertainty to the knowledge of our own mind. For example, if I judge\nthat there is an earth because I touch or see it, on the same\nground, and with still greater reason, I must be persuaded that my\nmind exists; for it may be, perhaps, that I think I touch the earth\nwhile there is one in existence; but it is not possible that I\nshould so judge, and my mind which thus judges not exist; and the\nsame holds good of whatever object is presented to our mind.\nXII. How it happens that every one does not come equally to know\nthis.\nThose who have not philosophized in order have had other opinions on\nthis subject, because they never distinguished with sufficient care\nthe mind from the body. For, although they had no difficulty in\nbelieving that they themselves existed, and that they had a higher\nassurance of this than of any other thing, nevertheless, as they did\nnot observe that by THEMSELVES, they ought here to understand their\nMINDS alone [when the question related to metaphysical certainty];\nand since, on the contrary, they rather meant their bodies which\nthey saw with their eyes, touched with their hands, and to which\nthey erroneously attributed the faculty of perception, they were\nprevented from distinctly apprehending the nature of the mind.\nXIII. In what sense the knowledge of other things depends upon the\nknowledge of God.\nBut when the mind, which thus knows itself but is still in doubt as\nto all other things, looks around on all sides, with a view to the\nfarther extension of its knowledge, it first of all discovers within\nitself the ideas of many things; and while it simply contemplates\nthem, and neither affirms nor denies that there is anything beyond\nitself corresponding to them, it is in no danger of erring. The mind\nalso discovers certain common notions out of which it frames various\ndemonstrations that carry conviction to such a degree as to render\ndoubt of their truth impossible, so long as we give attention to\nthem. For example, the mind has within itself ideas of numbers and\nfigures, and it has likewise among its common notions the principle\nTHAT IF EQUALS BE ADDED TO EQUALS THE WHOLES WILL BE EQUAL and the\nlike; from which it is easy to demonstrate that the three angles of\na triangle are equal to two right angles, etc. Now, so long as we\nattend to the premises from which this conclusion and others similar\nto it were deduced, we feel assured of their truth; but, as the mind\ncannot always think of these with attention, when it has the\nremembrance of a conclusion without recollecting the order of its\ndeduction, and is uncertain whether the author of its being has\ncreated it of a nature that is liable to be deceived, even in what\nappears most evident, it perceives that there is just ground to\ndistrust the truth of such conclusions, and that it cannot possess\nany certain knowledge until it has discovered its author.\nXIV. That we may validly infer the existence of God from necessary\nexistence being comprised in the concept we have of him.\nWhen the mind afterwards reviews the different ideas that are in it,\nit discovers what is by far the chief among them--that of a Being\nomniscient, all-powerful, and absolutely perfect; and it observes\nthat in this idea there is contained not only possible and\ncontingent existence, as in the ideas of all other things which it\nclearly perceives, but existence absolutely necessary and eternal.\nAnd just as because, for example, the equality of its three angles\nto two right angles is necessarily comprised in the idea of a\ntriangle, the mind is firmly persuaded that the three angles of a\ntriangle are equal to two right angles; so, from its perceiving\nnecessary and eternal existence to be comprised in the idea which it\nhas of an all-perfect Being, it ought manifestly to conclude that\nthis all-perfect Being exists.\nXV. That necessary existence is not in the same way comprised in\nthe notions which we have of other things, but merely contingent\nexistence.\nThe mind will be still more certain of the truth of this conclusion,\nif it consider that it has no idea of any other thing in which it\ncan discover that necessary existence is contained; for, from this\ncircumstance alone, it will discern that the idea of an all-perfect\nBeing has not been framed by itself, and that it does not represent\na chimera, but a true and immutable nature, which must exist since\nit can only be conceived as necessarily existing.\nXVI. That prejudices hinder many from clearly knowing the necessity\nof the existence of God.\nOur mind would have no difficulty in assenting to this truth, if it\nwere, first of all, wholly free from prejudices; but as we have been\naccustomed to distinguish, in all other things, essence from\nexistence, and to imagine at will many ideas of things which neither\nare nor have been, it easily happens, when we do not steadily fix\nour thoughts on the contemplation of the all-perfect Being, that a\ndoubt arises as to whether the idea we have of him is not one of\nthose which we frame at pleasure, or at least of that class to whose\nessence existence does not pertain.\nXVII. That the greater objective (representative) perfection there\nis in our idea of a thing, the greater also must be the perfection\nof its cause.\nWhen we further reflect on the various ideas that are in us, it is\neasy to perceive that there is not much difference among them, when\nwe consider them simply as certain modes of thinking, but that they\nare widely different, considered in reference to the objects they\nrepresent; and that their causes must be so much the more perfect\naccording to the degree of objective perfection contained in them.\n[Footnote: \"as what they represent of their object has more\nperfection.\"--FRENCH.] For there is no difference between this and\nthe case of a person who has the idea of a machine, in the\nconstruction of which great skill is displayed, in which\ncircumstances we have a right to inquire how he came by this idea,\nwhether, for example, he somewhere saw such a machine constructed by\nanother, or whether he was so accurately taught the mechanical\nsciences, or is endowed with such force of genius, that he was able\nof himself to invent it, without having elsewhere seen anything like\nit; for all the ingenuity which is contained in the idea objectively\nonly, or as it were in a picture, must exist at least in its first\nand chief cause, whatever that may be, not only objectively or\nrepresentatively, but in truth formally or eminently.\nXVIII. That the existence of God may be again inferred from the\nabove.\nThus, because we discover in our minds the idea of God, or of an\nall-perfect Being, we have a right to inquire into the source whence\nwe derive it; and we will discover that the perfections it\nrepresents are so immense as to render it quite certain that we\ncould only derive it from an all-perfect Being; that is, from a God\nreally existing. For it is not only manifest by the natural light\nthat nothing cannot be the cause of anything whatever, and that the\nmore perfect cannot arise from the less perfect, so as to be thereby\nproduced as by its efficient and total cause, but also that it is\nimpossible we can have the idea or representation of anything\nwhatever, unless there be somewhere, either in us or out of us, an\noriginal which comprises, in reality, all the perfections that are\nthus represented to us; but, as we do not in any way find in\nourselves those absolute perfections of which we have the idea, we\nmust conclude that they exist in some nature different from ours,\nthat is, in God, or at least that they were once in him; and it most\nmanifestly follows [from their infinity] that they are still there.\nXIX. That, although we may not comprehend the nature of God, there\nis yet nothing which we know so clearly as his perfections.\nThis will appear sufficiently certain and manifest to those who have\nbeen accustomed to contemplate the idea of God, and to turn their\nthoughts to his infinite perfections; for, although we may not\ncomprehend them, because it is of the nature of the infinite not to\nbe comprehended by what is finite, we nevertheless conceive them\nmore clearly and distinctly than material objects, for this reason,\nthat, being simple, and unobscured by limits,[Footnote: After\nLIMITS, \"what of them we do conceive is much less confused. There\nis, besides, no speculation more calculated to aid in perfecting our\nunderstanding, and which is more important than this, inasmuch as\nthe consideration of an object that has no limits to its perfections\nfills us with satisfaction and assurance.\"-FRENCH.] they occupy our\nmind more fully.\nXX. That we are not the cause of ourselves, but that this is God,\nand consequently that there is a God.\nBut, because every one has not observed this, and because, when we\nhave an idea of any machine in which great skill is displayed, we\nusually know with sufficient accuracy the manner in which we\nobtained it, and as we cannot even recollect when the idea we have\nof a God was communicated to us by him, seeing it was always in our\nminds, it is still necessary that we should continue our review, and\nmake inquiry after our author, possessing, as we do, the idea of the\ninfinite perfections of a God: for it is in the highest degree\nevident by the natural light, that that which knows something more\nperfect than itself, is not the source of its own being, since it\nwould thus have given to itself all the perfections which it knows;\nand that, consequently, it could draw its origin from no other being\nthan from him who possesses in himself all those perfections, that\nis, from God.\nXXI. That the duration alone of our life is sufficient to\ndemonstrate the existence of God.\nThe truth of this demonstration will clearly appear, provided we\nconsider the nature of time, or the duration of things; for this is\nof such a kind that its parts are not mutually dependent, and never\nco-existent; and, accordingly, from the fact that we now are, it\ndoes not necessarily follow that we shall be a moment afterwards,\nunless some cause, viz., that which first produced us, shall, as it\nwere, continually reproduce us, that is, conserve us. For we easily\nunderstand that there is no power in us by which we can conserve\nourselves, and that the being who has so much power as to conserve\nus out of himself, must also by so much the greater reason conserve\nhimself, or rather stand in need of being conserved by no one\nwhatever, and, in fine, be God.\nXXII. That in knowing the existence of God, in the manner here\nexplained, we likewise know all his attributes, as far as they can\nbe known by the natural light alone.\nThere is the great advantage in proving the existence of God in this\nway, viz., by his idea, that we at the same time know what he is, as\nfar as the weakness of our nature allows; for, reflecting on the\nidea we have of him which is born with us, we perceive that he is\neternal, omniscient, omnipotent, the source of all goodness and\ntruth, creator of all things, and that, in fine, he has in himself\nall that in which we can clearly discover any infinite perfection or\ngood that is not limited by any imperfection.\nXXIII. That God is not corporeal, and does not perceive by means of\nsenses as we do, or will the evil of sin.\nFor there are indeed many things in the world that are to a certain\nextent imperfect or limited, though possessing also some perfection;\nand it is accordingly impossible that any such can be in God. Thus,\nlooking to corporeal nature,[Footnote: In the French, \"since\nextension constitutes the nature of body.\"] since divisibility is\nincluded in local extension, and this indicates imperfection, it is\ncertain that God is not body. And although in men it is to some\ndegree a perfection to be capable of perceiving by means of the\nsenses, nevertheless since in every sense there is passivity\n[Footnote: In the French, \"because our perceptions arise from\nimpressions made upon us from another source,\" i.e., than\nourselves.] which indicates dependency, we must conclude that God is\nin no manner possessed of senses, and that he only understands and\nwills, not, however, like us, by acts in any way distinct, but\nalways by an act that is one, identical, and the simplest possible,\nunderstands, wills, and operates all, that is, all things that in\nreality exist; for he does not will the evil of sin, seeing this is\nbut the negation of being.\nXXIV. That in passing from the knowledge of God to the knowledge of\nthe creatures, it is necessary to remember that our understanding is\nfinite, and the power of God infinite.\nBut as we know that God alone is the true cause of all that is or\ncan be, we will doubtless follow the best way of philosophizing, if,\nfrom the knowledge we have of God himself, we pass to the\nexplication of the things which he has created, and essay to deduce\nit from the notions that are naturally in our minds, for we will\nthus obtain the most perfect science, that is, the knowledge of\neffects through their causes. But that we may be able to make this\nattempt with sufficient security from error, we must use the\nprecaution to bear in mind as much as possible that God, who is the\nauthor of things, is infinite, while we are wholly finite.\nXXV. That we must believe all that God has revealed, although it\nmay surpass the reach of our faculties.\nThus, if perhaps God reveal to us or others, matters concerning\nhimself which surpass the natural powers of our mind, such as the\nmysteries of the incarnation and of the trinity, we will not refuse\nto believe them, although we may not clearly understand them; nor\nwill we be in any way surprised to find in the immensity of his\nnature, or even in what he has created, many things that exceed our\ncomprehension.\nXXVI. That it is not needful to enter into disputes [Footnote: \"to\nessay to comprehend the infinite.\"--FRENCH.] regarding the infinite,\nbut merely to hold all that in which we can find no limits as\nindefinite, such as the extension of the world, the divisibility of\nthe parts of matter, the number of the stars, etc.\nWe will thus never embarrass ourselves by disputes about the\ninfinite, seeing it would be absurd for us who are finite to\nundertake to determine anything regarding it, and thus as it were to\nlimit it by endeavouring to comprehend it. We will accordingly give\nourselves no concern to reply to those who demand whether the half\nof an infinite line is also infinite, and whether an infinite number\nis even or odd, and the like, because it is only such as imagine\ntheir minds to be infinite who seem bound to entertain questions of\nthis sort. And, for our part, looking to all those things in which\nin certain senses, we discover no limits, we will not, therefore,\naffirm that they are infinite, but will regard them simply as\nindefinite. Thus, because we cannot imagine extension so great that\nwe cannot still conceive greater, we will say that the magnitude of\npossible things is indefinite, and because a body cannot be divided\ninto parts so small that each of these may not be conceived as again\ndivided into others still smaller, let us regard quantity as\ndivisible into parts whose number is indefinite; and as we cannot\nimagine so many stars that it would seem impossible for God to\ncreate more, let us suppose that their number is indefinite, and so\nin other instances.\nXXVII. What difference there is between the indefinite and the\ninfinite.\nAnd we will call those things indefinite rather than infinite, with\nthe view of reserving to God alone the appellation of infinite; in\nthe first place, because not only do we discover in him alone no\nlimits on any side, but also because we positively conceive that he\nadmits of none; and in the second place, because we do not in the\nsame way positively conceive that other things are in every part\nunlimited, but merely negatively admit that their limits, if they\nhave any, cannot be discovered by us.\nXXVIII. That we must examine, not the final, but the efficient,\ncauses of created things.\nLikewise, finally, we will not seek reasons of natural things from\nthe end which God or nature proposed to himself in their creation\n(i. e., final causes), [Footnote: \"We will not stop to consider the\nends which God proposed to himself in the creation of the world, and\nwe will entirely reject from our philosophy the search of final\ncauses!\"--French.] for we ought not to presume so far as to think\nthat we are sharers in the counsels of Deity, but, considering him\nas the efficient cause of all things, let us endeavour to discover\nby the natural light [Footnote: \"Faculty of reasoning.\"--FRENCH.]\nwhich he has planted in us, applied to those of his attributes of\nwhich he has been willing we should have some knowledge, what must\nbe concluded regarding those effects we perceive by our senses;\nbearing in mind, however, what has been already said, that we must\nonly confide in this natural light so long as nothing contrary to\nits dictates is revealed by God himself. [Footnote: The last clause,\nbeginning \"bearing in mind.\" is omitted in the French.]\nXXIX. That God is not the cause of our errors.\nThe first attribute of God which here falls to be considered, is\nthat he is absolutely veracious and the source of all light, so that\nit is plainly repugnant for him to deceive us, or to be properly and\npositively the cause of the errors to which we are consciously\nsubject; for although the address to deceive seems to be some mark\nof subtlety of mind among men, yet without doubt the will to deceive\nonly proceeds from malice or from fear and weakness, and\nconsequently cannot be attributed to God.\nXXX. That consequently all which we clearly perceive is true, and\nthat we are thus delivered from the doubts above proposed.\nWhence it follows, that the light of nature, or faculty of knowledge\ngiven us by God, can never compass any object which is not true, in\nas far as it attains to a knowledge of it, that is, in as far as the\nobject is clearly and distinctly apprehended. For God would have\nmerited the appellation of a deceiver if he had given us this\nfaculty perverted, and such as might lead us to take falsity for\ntruth [when we used it aright]. Thus the highest doubt is removed,\nwhich arose from our ignorance on the point as to whether perhaps\nour nature was such that we might be deceived even in those things\nthat appear to us the most evident. The same principle ought also to\nbe of avail against all the other grounds of doubting that have been\nalready enumerated. For mathematical truths ought now to be above\nsuspicion, since these are of the clearest. And if we perceive\nanything by our senses, whether while awake or asleep, we will\neasily discover the truth provided we separate what there is of\nclear and distinct in the knowledge from what is obscure and\nconfused. There is no need that I should here say more on this\nsubject, since it has already received ample treatment in the\nmetaphysical Meditations; and what follows will serve to explain it\nstill more accurately.\nXXXI. That our errors are, in respect of God, merely negations,\nbut, in respect of ourselves, privations.\nBut as it happens that we frequently fall into error, although God\nis no deceiver, if we desire to inquire into the origin and cause of\nour errors, with a view to guard against them, it is necessary to\nobserve that they depend less on our understanding than on our will,\nand that they have no need of the actual concourse of God, in order\nto their production; so that, when considered in reference to God,\nthey are merely negations, but in reference to ourselves,\nprivations.\nXXXII. That there are only two modes of thinking in us, viz., the\nperception of the understanding and the action of the will.\nFor all the modes of thinking of which we are conscious may be\nreferred to two general classes, the one of which is the perception\nor operation of the understanding, and the other the volition or\noperation of the will. Thus, to perceive by the senses (SENTIRE), to\nimagine, and to conceive things purely intelligible, are only\ndifferent modes of perceiving (PERCIP IENDI); but to desire, to be\naverse from, to affirm, to deny, to doubt, are different modes of\nwilling.\nXXXIII. That we never err unless when we judge of something which\nwe do not sufficiently apprehend.\nWhen we apprehend anything we are in no danger of error, if we\nrefrain from judging of it in any way; and even when we have formed\na judgment regarding it, we would never fall into error, provided we\ngave our assent only to what we clearly and distinctly perceived;\nbut the reason why we are usually deceived, is that we judge without\npossessing an exact knowledge of that of which we judge.\nXXXIV. That the will as well as the understanding is required for\njudging.\nI admit that the understanding is necessary for judging, there being\nno room to suppose that we can judge of that which we in no way\napprehend; but the will also is required in order to our assenting\nto what we have in any degree perceived. It is not necessary,\nhowever, at least to form any judgment whatever, that we have an\nentire and perfect apprehension of a thing; for we may assent to\nmany things of which we have only a very obscure and confused\nknowledge.\nXXXV. That the will is of greater extension than the understanding,\nand is thus the source of our errors.\nFurther, the perception of the intellect extends only to the few\nthings that are presented to it, and is always very limited: the\nwill, on the other hand, may, in a certain sense, be said to be\ninfinite, because we observe nothing that can be the object of the\nwill of any other, even of the unlimited will of God, to which ours\ncannot also extend, so that we easily carry it beyond the objects we\nclearly perceive; and when we do this, it is not wonderful that we\nhappen to be deceived.\nXXXVI. That our errors cannot be imputed to God.\nBut although God has not given us an omniscient understanding, he is\nnot on this account to be considered in any wise the author of our\nerrors, for it is of the nature of created intellect to be finite,\nand of finite intellect not to embrace all things.\nXXXVII. That the chief perfection of man is his being able to act\nfreely or by will, and that it is this which renders him worthy of\npraise or blame.\nThat the will should be the more extensive is in harmony with its\nnature: and it is a high perfection in man to be able to act by\nmeans of it, that is, freely; and thus in a peculiar way to be the\nmaster of his own actions, and merit praise or blame. For self-\nacting machines are not commended because they perform with\nexactness all the movements for which they were adapted, seeing\ntheir motions are carried on necessarily; but the maker of them is\npraised on account of the exactness with which they were framed,\nbecause he did not act of necessity, but freely; and, on the same\nprinciple, we must attribute to ourselves something more on this\naccount, that when we embrace truth, we do so not of necessity, but\nfreely.\nXXXVIII. That error is a defect in our mode of acting, not in our\nnature; and that the faults of their subjects may be frequently\nattributed to other masters, but never to God.\nIt is true, that as often as we err, there is some defect in our\nmode of action or in the use of our liberty, but not in our nature,\nbecause this is always the same, whether our judgments be true or\nfalse. And although God could have given to us such perspicacity of\nintellect that we should never have erred, we have, notwithstanding,\nno right to demand this of him; for, although with us he who was\nable to prevent evil and did not is held guilty of it, God is not in\nthe same way to be reckoned responsible for our errors because he\nhad the power to prevent them, inasmuch as the dominion which some\nmen possess over others has been instituted for the purpose of\nenabling them to hinder those under them from doing evil, whereas\nthe dominion which God exercises over the universe is perfectly\nabsolute and free. For this reason we ought to thank him for the\ngoods he has given us, and not complain that he has not blessed us\nwith all which we know it was in his power to impart.\nXXXIX. That the liberty of our will is self-evident.\nFinally, it is so manifest that we possess a free will, capable of\ngiving or withholding its assent, that this truth must be reckoned\namong the first and most common notions which are born with us.\nThis, indeed, has already very clearly appeared, for when essaying\nto doubt of all things, we went so far as to suppose even that he\nwho created us employed his limitless power in deceiving us in every\nway, we were conscious nevertheless of being free to abstain from\nbelieving what was not in every respect certain and undoubted. But\nthat of which we are unable to doubt at such a time is as self-\nevident and clear as any thing we can ever know.\nXL. That it is likewise certain that God has fore-ordained all\nthings.\nBut because what we have already discovered of God, gives us the\nassurance that his power is so immense that we would sin in thinking\nourselves capable of ever doing anything which he had not ordained\nbeforehand, we should soon be embarrassed in great difficulties if\nwe undertook to harmonise the pre-ordination of God with the freedom\nof our will, and endeavoured to comprehend both truths at once.\nXLI. How the freedom of our will may be reconciled with the Divine\npre-ordination.\nBut, in place of this, we will be free from these embarrassments if\nwe recollect that our mind is limited, while the power of God, by\nwhich he not only knew from all eternity what is or can be, but also\nwilled and pre-ordained it, is infinite. It thus happens that we\npossess sufficient intelligence to know clearly and distinctly that\nthis power is in God, but not enough to comprehend how he leaves the\nfree actions of men indeterminate} and, on the other hand, we have\nsuch consciousness of the liberty and indifference which exists in\nourselves, that there is nothing we more clearly or perfectly\ncomprehend: [so that the omnipotence of God ought not to keep us\nfrom believing it]. For it would be absurd to doubt of that of which\nwe are fully conscious, and which we experience as existing in\nourselves, because we do not comprehend another matter which, from\nits very nature, we know to be incomprehensible.\nXLII. How, although we never will to err, it is nevertheless by our\nwill that we do err.\nBut now since we know that all our errors depend upon our will, and\nas no one wishes to deceive himself, it may seem wonderful that\nthere is any error in our judgments at all. It is necessary to\nremark, however, that there is a great difference between willing to\nbe deceived, and willing to yield assent to opinions in which it\nhappens that error is found. For though there is no one who\nexpressly wishes to fall into error, we will yet hardly find any one\nwho is not ready to assent to things in which, unknown to himself,\nerror lurks; and it even frequently happens that it is the desire\nitself of following after truth that leads those not fully aware of\nthe order in which it ought to be sought for, to pass judgment on\nmatters of which they have no adequate knowledge, and thus to fall\ninto error.\nXLIII. That we shall never err if we give our assent only to what\nwe clearly and distinctly perceive.\nBut it is certain we will never admit falsity for truth, so long as\nwe judge only of that which we clearly and distinctly perceive;\nbecause, as God is no deceiver, the faculty of knowledge which he\nhas given us cannot be fallacious, nor, for the same reason, the\nfaculty of will, when we do not extend it beyond the objects we\nclearly know. And even although this truth could not be established\nby reasoning, the minds of all have been so impressed by nature as\nspontaneously to assent to whatever is clearly perceived, and to\nexperience an impossibility to doubt of its truth.\nXLIV. That we uniformly judge improperly when we assent to what we\ndo not clearly perceive, although our judgment may chance to be\ntrue; and that it is frequently our memory which deceives us by\nleading us to believe that certain things were formerly sufficiently\nunderstood by us.\nIt is likewise certain that, when we approve of any reason which we\ndo not apprehend, we are either deceived, or, if we stumble on the\ntruth, it is only by chance, and thus we can never possess the\nassurance that we are not in error. I confess it seldom happens that\nwe judge of a thing when we have observed we do not apprehend it,\nbecause it is a dictate of the natural light never to judge of what\nwe do not know. But we most frequently err in this, that we presume\nupon a past knowledge of much to which we give our assent, as to\nsomething treasured up in the memory, and perfectly known to us;\nwhereas, in truth, we have no such knowledge.\nXLV. What constitutes clear and distinct perception.\nThere are indeed a great many persons who, through their whole\nlifetime, never perceive anything in a way necessary for judging of\nit properly; for the knowledge upon which we can establish a certain\nand indubitable judgment must be not only clear, but also, distinct.\nI call that clear which is present and manifest to the mind giving\nattention to it, just as we are said clearly to see objects when,\nbeing present to the eye looking on, they stimulate it with\nsufficient force. and it is disposed to regard them; but the\ndistinct is that which is so precise and different from all other\nobjects as to comprehend in itself only what is clear. [Footnote:\n\"what appears manifestly to him who considers it as he ought.\"--\nFRENCH.]\nXLVI. It is shown, from the example of pain, that a perception may\nbe clear without being distinct, but that it cannot be distinct\nunless it is clear.\nFor example, when any one feels intense pain, the knowledge which he\nhas of this pain is very clear, but it is not always distinct; for\nmen usually confound it with the obscure judgment they form\nregarding its nature, and think that there is in the suffering part\nsomething similar to the sensation of pain of which they are alone\nconscious. And thus perception may be clear without being distinct,\nbut it can never be distinct without likewise being clear.\nXLVII. That, to correct the prejudices of our early years, we must\nconsider what is clear in each of our simple [Footnote: \"first.\"--\nFRENCH.] notions.\nAnd, indeed, in our early years, the mind was so immersed in the\nbody, that, although it perceived many things with sufficient\nclearness, it yet knew nothing distinctly; and since even at that\ntime we exercised our judgment in many matters, numerous prejudices\nwere thus contracted, which, by the majority, are never afterwards\nlaid aside. But that we may now be in a position to get rid of\nthese, I will here briefly enumerate all the simple notions of which\nour thoughts are composed, and distinguish in each what is clear\nfrom what is obscure, or fitted to lead into error.\nXLVIII. That all the objects of our knowledge are to be regarded\neither (1) as things or the affections of things: or (2) as eternal\ntruths; with the enumeration of things.\nWhatever objects fall under our knowledge we consider either as\nthings or the affections of things,[Footnote: Things and the\naffections of things are (in the French) equivalent to \"what has\nsome (i.e., a REAL) existence,\" as opposed to the class of \"eternal\ntruths,\" which have merely an IDEAL existence.] or as eternal truths\npossessing no existence beyond our thought. Of the first class the\nmost general are substance, duration, order, number, and perhaps\nalso some others, which notions apply to all the kinds of things. I\ndo not, however, recognise more than two highest kinds (SUMMA\nGENERA) of things; the first of intellectual things, or such as have\nthe power of thinking, including mind or thinking substance and its\nproperties; the second, of material things, embracing extended\nsubstance, or body and its properties. Perception, volition, and all\nmodes as well of knowing as of willing, are related to thinking\nsubstance; on the other hand, to extended substance we refer\nmagnitude, or extension in length, breadth, and depth, figure,\nmotion, situation, divisibility of parts themselves, and the like.\nThere are, however, besides these, certain things of which we have\nan internal experience that ought not to be referred either to the\nmind of itself, or to the body alone, but to the close and intimate\nunion between them, as will hereafter be shown in its place. Of this\nclass are the appetites of hunger and thirst, etc., and also the\nemotions or passions of the mind which are not exclusively mental\naffections, as the emotions of anger, joy, sadness, love, etc.; and,\nfinally, all the sensations, as of pain, titillation, light and\ncolours, sounds, smells, tastes, heat, hardness, and the other\ntactile qualities.\nXLIX. That the eternal truths cannot be thus enumerated, but that\nthis is not necessary.\nWhat I have already enumerated we are to regard as things, or the\nqualities or modes of things. We now come to speak of eternal\ntruths. When we apprehend that it is impossible a thing can arise\nfrom nothing, this proposition, EX NIHILO NIHIL FIT, is not\nconsidered as somewhat existing, or as the mode of a thing, but as\nan eternal truth having its seat in our mind, and is called a common\nnotion or axiom. Of this class are the following:--It is impossible\nthe same thing can at once be and not be; what is done cannot be\nundone; he who thinks must exist while he thinks; and innumerable\nothers, the whole of which it is indeed difficult to enumerate, but\nthis is not necessary, since, if blinded by no prejudices, we cannot\nfail to know them when the occasion of thinking them occurs.\nL. That these truths are clearly perceived, but not equally by all\nmen, on account of prejudices.\nAnd, indeed, with regard to these common notions, it is not to be\ndoubted that they can be clearly and distinctly known, for otherwise\nthey would not merit this appellation: as, in truth, some of them\nare not, with respect to all men, equally deserving of the name,\nbecause they are not equally admitted by all: not, however, from\nthis reason, as I think, that the faculty of knowledge of one man\nextends farther than that of another, but rather because these\ncommon notions are opposed to the prejudices of some, who, on this\naccount, are not able readily to embrace them, even although others,\nwho are free from those prejudices, apprehend them with the greatest\nclearness.\nLI. What substance is, and that the term is not applicable to God\nand the creatures in the same sense.\nBut with regard to what we consider as things or the modes of\nthings, it is worth while to examine each of them by itself. By\nsubstance we can conceive nothing else than a thing which exists in\nsuch a way as to stand in need of nothing beyond itself in order to\nits existence. And, in truth, there can be conceived but one\nsubstance which is absolutely independent, and that is God. We\nperceive that all other things can exist only by help of the\nconcourse of God. And, accordingly, the term substance does not\napply to God and the creatures UNIVOCALLY, to adopt a term familiar\nin the schools; that is, no signification of this word can be\ndistinctly understood which is common to God and them.\nLII. That the term is applicable univocally to the mind and the\nbody, and how substance itself is known.\nCreated substances, however, whether corporeal or thinking, may be\nconceived under this common concept; for these are things which, in\norder to their existence, stand in need of nothing but the concourse\nof God. But yet substance cannot be first discovered merely from its\nbeing a thing which exists independently, for existence by itself is\nnot observed by us. We easily, however, discover substance itself\nfrom any attribute of it, by this common notion, that of nothing\nthere are no attributes, properties, or qualities: for, from\nperceiving that some attribute is present, we infer that some\nexisting thing or substance to which it may be attributed is also of\nnecessity present.\nLIII. That of every substance there is one principal attribute, as\nthinking of the mind, extension of the body.\nBut, although any attribute is sufficient to lead us to the\nknowledge of substance, there is, however, one principal property of\nevery substance, which constitutes its nature or essence, and upon\nwhich all the others depend. Thus, extension in length, breadth, and\ndepth, constitutes the nature of corporeal substance; and thought\nthe nature of thinking substance. For every other thing that can be\nattributed to body, presupposes extension, and is only some mode of\nan extended thing; as all the properties we discover in the mind are\nonly diverse modes of thinking. Thus, for example, we cannot\nconceive figure unless in something extended, nor motion unless in\nextended space, nor imagination, sensation, or will, unless in a\nthinking thing. But, on the other hand, we can conceive extension\nwithout figure or motion, and thought without imagination or\nsensation, and so of the others; as is clear to any one who attends\nto these matters.\nLIV. How we may have clear and distinct notions of the substance\nwhich thinks, of that which is corporeal, and of God.\nAnd thus we may easily have two clear and distinct notions or ideas,\nthe one of created substance, which thinks, the other of corporeal\nsubstance, provided we carefully distinguish all the attributes of\nthought from those of extension. We may also have a clear and\ndistinct idea of an uncreated and independent thinking substance,\nthat is, of God, provided we do not suppose that this idea\nadequately represents to us all that is in God, and do not mix up\nwith it anything fictitious, but attend simply to the characters\nthat are comprised in the notion we have of him, and which we\nclearly know to belong to the nature of an absolutely perfect Being.\nFor no one can deny that there is in us such an idea of God, without\ngroundlessly supposing that there is no knowledge of God at all in\nthe human mind.\nLV. How duration, order, and number may be also distinctly\nconceived.\nWe will also have most distinct conceptions of duration, order, and\nnumber, if, in place of mixing up with our notions of them that\nwhich properly belongs to the concept of substance, we merely think\nthat the duration of a thing is a mode under which we conceive this\nthing, in so far as it continues to exist; and, in like manner, that\norder and number are not in reality different from things disposed\nin order and numbered, but only modes under which we diversely\nconsider these things.\nLVI. What are modes, qualities, attributes.\nAnd, indeed, we here understand by modes the same with what we\nelsewhere designate attributes or qualities. But when we consider\nsubstance as affected or varied by them, we use the term modes; when\nfrom this variation it may be denominated of such a kind, we adopt\nthe term qualities [to designate the different modes which cause it\nto be so named]; and, finally, when we simply regard these modes as\nin the substance, we call them attributes. Accordingly, since God\nmust be conceived as superior to change, it is not proper to say\nthat there are modes or qualities in him, but simply attributes; and\neven in created things that which is found in them always in the\nsame mode, as existence and duration in the thing which exists and\nendures, ought to be called attribute and not mode or quality.\nLVII. That some attributes exist in the things to which they are\nattributed, and others only in our thought; and what duration and\ntime are.\nOf these attributes or modes there are some which exist in the\nthings themselves, and others that have only an existence in our\nthought; thus, for example, time, which we distinguish from duration\ntaken in its generality, and call the measure of motion, is only a\ncertain mode under which we think duration itself, for we do not\nindeed conceive the duration of things that are moved to be\ndifferent from the duration of things that are not moved: as is\nevident from this, that if two bodies are in motion for an hour, the\none moving quickly and the other slowly, we do not reckon more time\nin the one than in the other, although there may be much more motion\nin the one of the bodies than in the other. But that we may\ncomprehend the duration of all things under a common measure, we\ncompare their duration with that of the greatest and most regular\nmotions that give rise to years and days, and which we call time;\nhence what is so designated is nothing superadded to duration, taken\nin its generality, but a mode of thinking.\nLVIII. That number and all universals are only modes of thought.\nIn the same way number, when it is not considered as in created\nthings, but merely in the abstract or in general, is only a mode of\nthinking; and the same is true of all those general ideas we call\nuniversals.\nLIX. How universals are formed; and what are the five common, viz.,\ngenus, species, difference, property, and accident.\nUniversals arise merely from our making use of one and the same idea\nin thinking of all individual objects between which there subsists a\ncertain likeness; and when we comprehend all the objects represented\nby this idea under one name, this term likewise becomes universal.\nFor example, when we see two stones, and do not regard their nature\nfarther than to remark that there are two of them, we form the idea\nof a certain number, which we call the binary; and when we\nafterwards see two birds or two trees, and merely take notice of\nthem so far as to observe that there are two of them, we again take\nup the same idea as before, which is, accordingly, universal; and we\nlikewise give to this number the same universal appellation of\nbinary. In the same way, when we consider a figure of three sides,\nwe form a certain idea, which we call the idea of a triangle, and we\nafterwards make use of it as the universal to represent to our mind\nall other figures of three sides. But when we remark more\nparticularly that of figures of three sides, some have a right angle\nand others not, we form the universal idea of a right-angled\ntriangle, which being related to the preceding as more general, may\nbe called species; and the right angle the universal difference by\nwhich right-angled triangles are distinguished from all others; and\nfarther, because the square of the side which sustains the right\nangle is equal to the squares of the other two sides, and because\nthis property belongs only to this species of triangles, we may call\nit the universal property of the species. Finally, if we suppose\nthat of these triangles some are moved and others not, this will be\ntheir universal accident; and, accordingly, we commonly reckon five\nuniversals, viz., genus, species, difference, property, accident.\nLX. Of distinctions; and first of the real.\nBut number in things themselves arises from the distinction there is\nbetween them: and distinction is threefold, viz., real, modal, and\nof reason. The real properly subsists between two or more\nsubstances; and it is sufficient to assure us that two substances\nare really mutually distinct, if only we are able clearly and\ndistinctly to conceive the one of them without the other. For the\nknowledge we have of God renders it certain that he can effect all\nthat of which we have a distinct idea: wherefore, since we have now,\nfor example, the idea of an extended and corporeal substance, though\nwe as yet do not know with certainty whether any such thing is\nreally existent, nevertheless, merely because we have the idea of\nit, we may be assured that such may exist; and, if it really exists,\nthat every part which we can determine by thought must be really\ndistinct from the other parts of the same substance. In the same\nway, since every one is conscious that he thinks, and that he in\nthought can exclude from himself every other substance, whether\nthinking or extended, it is certain that each of us thus considered\nis really distinct from every other thinking and corporeal\nsubstance. And although we suppose that God united a body to a soul\nso closely that it was impossible to form a more intimate union, and\nthus made a composite whole, the two substances would remain really\ndistinct, notwithstanding this union; for with whatever tie God\nconnected them, he was not able to rid himself of the power he\npossessed of separating them, or of conserving the one apart from\nthe other, and the things which God can separate or conserve\nseparately are really distinct.\nLXI. Of the modal distinction.\nThere are two kinds of modal distinctions, viz., that between the\nmode properly so-called and the substance of which it is a mode, and\nthat between two modes of the same substance. Of the former we have\nan example in this, that we can clearly apprehend substance apart\nfrom the mode which we say differs from it; while, on the other\nhand, we cannot conceive this mode without conceiving the substance\nitself. There is, for example, a modal distinction between figure or\nmotion and corporeal substance in which both exist; there is a\nsimilar distinction between affirmation or recollection and the\nmind. Of the latter kind we have an illustration in our ability to\nrecognise the one of two modes apart from the other, as figure apart\nfrom motion, and motion apart from figure; though we cannot think of\neither the one or the other without thinking of the common substance\nin which they adhere. If, for example, a stone is moved, and is\nwithal square, we can, indeed, conceive its square figure without\nits motion, and reciprocally its motion without its square figure;\nbut we can conceive neither this motion nor this figure apart from\nthe substance of the stone. As for the distinction according to\nwhich the mode of one substance is different from another substance,\nor from the mode of another substance, as the motion of one body is\ndifferent from another body or from the mind, or as motion is\ndifferent from doubt, it seems to me that it should be called real\nrather than modal, because these modes cannot be clearly conceived\napart from the really distinct substances of which they are the\nmodes.\nLXII. Of the distinction of reason (logical distinction).\nFinally, the distinction of reason is that between a substance and\nsome one of its attributes, without which it is impossible, however,\nwe can have a distinct conception of the substance itself; or\nbetween two such attributes of a common substance, the one of which\nwe essay to think without the other. This distinction is manifest\nfrom our inability to form a clear and distinct idea of such\nsubstance, if we separate from it such attribute; or to have a clear\nperception of the one of two such attributes if we separate it from\nthe other. For example, because any substance which ceases to endure\nceases also to exist, duration is not distinct from substance except\nin thought (RATIONE); and in general all the modes of thinking which\nwe consider as in objects differ only in thought, as well from the\nobjects of which they are thought as from each other in a common\nobject.[Footnote: \"and generally all the attributes that lead us to\nentertain different thoughts of the same thing, such as, for\nexample, the extension of body and its property of divisibility, do\nnot differ from the body which is to us the object of them, or from\neach other, unless as we sometimes confusedly think the one without\nthinking the other.\"--FRENCH.] It occurs, indeed, to me that I have\nelsewhere classed this kind of distinction with the modal (viz.,\ntowards the end of the Reply to the First Objections to the\nMeditations on the First Philosophy); but there it was only\nnecessary to treat of these distinctions generally, and it was\nsufficient for my purpose at that time simply to distinguish both of\nthem from the real.\nLXIII. How thought and extension may be distinctly known, as\nconstituting, the one the nature of mind, the other that of body.\nThought and extension may be regarded as constituting the natures of\nintelligent and corporeal substance; and then they must not be\notherwise conceived than as the thinking and extended substances\nthemselves, that is, as mind and body, which in this way are\nconceived with the greatest clearness and distinctness. Moreover, we\nmore easily conceive extended or thinking substance than substance\nby itself, or with the omission of its thinking or extension. For\nthere is some difficulty in abstracting the notion of substance from\nthe notions of thinking and extension, which, in truth, are only\ndiverse in thought itself (i.e., logically different); and a concept\nis not more distinct because it comprehends fewer properties, but\nbecause we accurately distinguish what is comprehended in it from\nall other notions.\nLXIV. How these may likewise be distinctly conceived as modes of\nsubstance.\nThought and extension may be also considered as modes of substance;\nin as far, namely, as the same mind may have many different\nthoughts, and the same body, with its size unchanged, may be\nextended in several diverse ways, at one time more in length and\nless in breadth or depth, and at another time more in breadth and\nless in length; and then they are modally distinguished from\nsubstance, and can be conceived not less clearly and distinctly,\nprovided they be not regarded as substances or things separated from\nothers, but simply as modes of things. For by regarding them as in\nthe substances of which they are the modes, we distinguish them from\nthese substances, and take them for what in truth they are: whereas,\non the other hand, if we wish to consider them apart from the\nsubstances in which they are, we should by this itself regard them\nas self-subsisting things, and thus confound the ideas of mode and\nsubstance.\nLXV. How we may likewise know their modes.\nIn the same way we will best apprehend the diverse modes of thought,\nas intellection, imagination, recollection, volition, etc., and also\nthe diverse modes of extension, or those that belong to extension,\nas all figures, the situation of parts and their motions, provided\nwe consider them simply as modes of the things in which they are;\nand motion as far as it is concerned, provided we think merely of\nlocomotion, without seeking to know the force that produces it, and\nwhich nevertheless I will essay to explain in its own place.\nLXVI. How our sensations, affections, and appetites may be clearly\nknown, although we are frequently wrong in our judgments regarding\nthem.\nThere remain our sensations, affections, and appetites, of which we\nmay also have a clear knowledge, if we take care to comprehend in\nthe judgments we form of them only that which is precisely contained\nin our perception of them, and of which we are immediately\nconscious. There is, however, great difficulty in observing this, at\nleast in respect of sensations; because we have all, without\nexception, from our youth judged that all the things we perceived by\nour senses had an existence beyond our thought, and that they were\nentirely similar to the sensations, that is, perceptions, we had of\nthem. Thus when, for example, we saw a certain colour, we thought we\nsaw something occupying a place out of us, and which was entirely\nsimilar to that idea of colour we were then conscious of; and from\nthe habit of judging in this way, we seemed to see this so clearly\nand distinctly that we esteemed it (i.e., the externality of the\ncolour) certain and indubitable.\nLXVII. That we are frequently deceived in our judgments regarding\npain itself.\nThe same prejudice has place in all our other sensations, even in\nthose of titillation and pain. For though we are not in the habit of\nbelieving that there exist out of us objects that resemble\ntitillation and pain, we do not nevertheless consider these\nsensations as in the mind alone, or in our perception, but as in the\nhand, or foot, or some other part of our body. There is no reason,\nhowever, to constrain us to believe that the pain, for example,\nwhich we feel, as it were, in the foot is something out of the mind\nexisting in the foot, or that the light which we see, as it were, in\nthe sun exists in the sun as it is in us. Both these beliefs are\nprejudices of our early years, as will clearly appear in the sequel.\nLXVIII. How in these things what we clearly conceive is to be\ndistinguished from that in which we may be deceived.\nBut that we may distinguish what is clear in our sensations from\nwhat is obscure, we ought most carefully to observe that we possess\na clear and distinct knowledge of pain, colour, and other things of\nthis sort, when we consider them simply as sensations or thoughts;\nbut that, when they are judged to be certain things subsisting\nbeyond our mind, we are wholly unable to form any conception of\nthem. Indeed, when any one tells us that he sees colour in a body or\nfeels pain in one of his limbs, this is exactly the same as if he\nsaid that he there saw or felt something of the nature of which he\nwas entirely ignorant, or that he did not know what he saw or felt.\nFor although, when less attentively examining his thoughts, a person\nmay easily persuade himself that he has some knowledge of it, since\nhe supposes that there is something resembling that sensation of\ncolour or of pain of which he is conscious; yet, if he reflects on\nwhat the sensation of colour or pain represents to him as existing\nin a coloured body or in a wounded member, he will find that of such\nhe has absolutely no knowledge.\nLXIX. That magnitude, figure, etc., are known far differently from\ncolour, pain, etc.\nWhat we have said above will be more manifest; especially if we\nconsider that size in the body perceived, figure, motion (at least\nlocal, for philosophers by fancying other kinds of motion have\nrendered its nature less intelligible to themselves), the situation\nof parts, duration, number, and those other properties which, as we\nhave already said, we clearly perceive in all bodies, are known by\nus in a way altogether different from that in which we know what\ncolour is in the same body, or pain, smell, taste, or any other of\nthose properties which I have said above must be referred to the\nsenses. For although when we see a body we are not less assured of\nits existence from its appearing figured than from its appearing\ncoloured,[Footnote: \"by the colour we perceive on occasion of it.\"--\nFRENCH.] we yet know with far greater clearness its property of\nfigure than its colour.\nLXX. That we may judge of sensible things in two ways, by the one\nof which we avoid error, by the other fall into it.\nIt is thus manifest that to say we perceive colours in objects is in\nreality equivalent to saying we perceive something in objects and\nare yet ignorant of what it is, except as that which determines in\nus a certain highly vivid and clear sensation, which we call the\nsensation of colours. There is, however, very great diversity in the\nmanner of judging: for so long as we simply judge that there is an\nunknown something in objects (that is, in things such as they are,\nfrom which the sensation reached us), so far are we from falling\ninto error that, on the contrary, we thus rather provide against it,\nfor we are less apt to judge rashly of a thing which we observe we\ndo not know. But when we think we perceive colours in objects,\nalthough we are in reality ignorant of what we then denominate\ncolour, and are unable to conceive any resemblance between the\ncolour we suppose to be in objects, and that of which we are\nconscious in sensation, yet because we do not observe this, or\nbecause there are in objects several properties, as size, figure,\nnumber, etc., which, as we clearly know, exist, or may exist in them\nas they are perceived by our senses or conceived by our\nunderstanding, we easily glide into the error of holding that what\nis called colour in objects is something entirely resembling the\ncolour we perceive, and thereafter of supposing that we have a clear\nperception of what is in no way perceived by us.\nLXXI. That the chief cause of our errors is to be found in the\nprejudices of our childhood.\nAnd here we may notice the first and chief cause of our errors. In\nearly life the mind was so closely bound to the body that it\nattended to nothing beyond the thoughts by which it perceived the\nobjects that made impression on the body; nor as yet did it refer\nthese thoughts to anything existing beyond itself, but simply felt\npain when the body was hurt, or pleasure when anything beneficial to\nthe body occurred, or if the body was so highly affected that it was\nneither greatly benefited nor hurt, the mind experienced the\nsensations we call tastes, smells, sounds, heat, cold, light,\ncolours, and the like, which in truth are representative of nothing\nexisting out of our mind, and which vary according to the\ndiversities of the parts and modes in which the body is affected.\n[Footnote: \"which vary according to the diversities of the movements\nthat pass from all parts of our body to the part of the brain to\nwhich it (the mind) is closely joined and united.\"--FRENCH.] The\nmind at the same time also perceived magnitudes, figures, motions,\nand the like, which were not presented to it as sensations but as\nthings or the modes of things existing, or at least capable of\nexisting out of thought, although it did not yet observe this\ndifference between these two kinds of perceptions. And afterwards\nwhen the machine of the body, which has been so fabricated by nature\nthat it can of its own inherent power move itself in various ways,\nby turning itself at random on every side, followed after what was\nuseful and avoided what was detrimental; the mind, which was closely\nconnected with it, reflecting on the objects it pursued or avoided,\nremarked, for the first time, that they existed out of itself, and\nnot only attributed to them magnitudes, figures, motions, and the\nlike, which it apprehended either as things or as the modes of\nthings, but, in addition, attributed to them tastes, odours, and the\nother ideas of that sort, the sensations of which were caused by\nitself; [Footnote: \"which it perceived on occasion of them\" (i.e.,\nof external objects).--FRENCH.] and as it only considered other\nobjects in so far as they were useful to the body, in which it was\nimmersed, it judged that there was greater or less reality in each\nobject, according as the impressions it caused on the body were more\nor less powerful. Hence arose the belief that there was more\nsubstance or body in rocks and metals than in air or water, because\nthe mind perceived in them more hardness and weight. Moreover, the\nair was thought to be merely nothing so long as we experienced no\nagitation of it by the wind, or did not feel it hot or cold. And\nbecause the stars gave hardly more light than the slender flames of\ncandles, we supposed that each star was but of this size. Again,\nsince the mind did not observe that the earth moved on its axis, or\nthat its superficies was curved like that of a globe, it was on that\naccount more ready to judge the earth immovable and its surface\nflat. And our mind has been imbued from our infancy with a thousand\nother prejudices of the same sort which afterwards in our youth we\nforgot we had accepted without sufficient examination, and admitted\nas possessed of the highest truth and clearness, as if they had been\nknown by means of our senses, or implanted in us by nature.\nLXXII. That the second cause of our errors is that we cannot forget\nthese prejudices.\nAnd although now in our mature years, when the mind, being no longer\nwholly subject to the body, is not in the habit of referring all\nthings to it, but also seeks to discover the truth of things\nconsidered in themselves, we observe the falsehood of a great many\nof the judgments we had before formed; yet we experience a\ndifficulty in expunging them from our memory, and, so long as they\nremain there, they give rise to various errors. Thus, for example,\nsince from our earliest years we imagined the stars to be of very\nsmall size, we find it highly difficult to rid ourselves of this\nimagination, although assured by plain astronomical reasons that\nthey are of the greatest,--so prevailing is the power of\npreconceived opinion.\nLXXIII. The third cause is, that we become fatigued by attending to\nthose objects which are not present to the senses; and that we are\nthus accustomed to judge of these not from present perception but\nfrom pre-conceived opinion.\nBesides, our mind cannot attend to any object without at length\nexperiencing some pain and fatigue; and of all objects it has the\ngreatest difficulty in attending to those which are present neither\nto the senses nor to the imagination: whether for the reason that\nthis is natural to it from its union with the body, or because in\nour early years, being occupied merely with perceptions and\nimaginations, it has become more familiar with, and acquired greater\nfacility in thinking in those modes than in any other. Hence it also\nhappens that many are unable to conceive any substance except what\nis imaginable and corporeal, and even sensible. For they are\nignorant of the circumstance, that those objects alone are\nimaginable which consist in extension, motion, and figure, while\nthere are many others besides these that are intelligible; and they\npersuade themselves that nothing can subsist but body, and, finally,\nthat there is no body which is not sensible. And since in truth we\nperceive no object such as it is by sense alone [but only by our\nreason exercised upon sensible objects], as will hereafter be\nclearly shown, it thus happens that the majority during life\nperceive nothing unless in a confused way.\nLXXIV. The fourth source of our errors is, that we attach our\nthoughts to words which do not express them with accuracy.\nFinally, since for the use of speech we attach all our conceptions\nto words by which to express them, and commit to memory our thoughts\nin connection with these terms, and as we afterwards find it more\neasy to recall the words than the things signified by them, we can\nscarcely conceive anything with such distinctness as to separate\nentirely what we conceive from the words that were selected to\nexpress it. On this account the majority attend to words rather than\nto things; and thus very frequently assent to terms without\nattaching to them any meaning, either because they think they once\nunderstood them, or imagine they received them from others by whom\nthey were correctly understood. This, however, is not the place to\ntreat of this matter in detail, seeing the nature of the human body\nhas not yet been expounded, nor the existence even of body\nestablished; enough, nevertheless, appears to have been said to\nenable one to distinguish such of our conceptions as are clear and\ndistinct from those that are obscure and confused.\nLXXV. Summary of what must be observed in order to philosophize\ncorrectly.\nWherefore if we would philosophize in earnest, and give ourselves to\nthe search after all the truths we are capable of knowing, we must,\nin the first place, lay aside our prejudices; in other words, we\nmust take care scrupulously to withhold our assent from the opinions\nwe have formerly admitted, until upon new examination we discover\nthat they are true. We must, in the next place, make an orderly\nreview of the notions we have in our minds, and hold as true all and\nonly those which we will clearly and distinctly apprehend. In this\nway we will observe, first of all, that we exist in so far as it is\nour nature to think, and at the same time that there is a God upon\nwhom we depend; and after considering his attributes we will be able\nto investigate the truth of all other things, since God is the cause\nof them. Besides the notions we have of God and of our mind, we will\nlikewise find that we possess the knowledge of many propositions\nwhich are eternally true, as, for example, that nothing cannot be\nthe cause of anything, etc. We will farther discover in our minds\nthe knowledge of a corporeal or extended nature that may be moved,\ndivided, etc., and also of certain sensations that affect us, as of\npain, colours, tastes, etc., although we do not yet know the cause\nof our being so affected; and, comparing what we have now learne'd,\nby examining those things in their order, with our former confused\nknowledge of them, we will acquire the habit of forming clear and\ndistinct conceptions of all the objects we are capable of knowing.\nIn these few precepts seem to me to be comprised the most general\nand important principles of human knowledge.\nLXXVI. That we ought to prefer the Divine authority to our\nperception; [Footnote: \"reasonings.\"--FRENCH]. but that, apart from\nthings revealed, we ought to assent to nothing that we do not\nclearly apprehend.\nAbove all, we must impress on our memory the infallible rule, that\nwhat God has revealed is incomparably more certain than anything\nelse; and that, we ought to submit our belief to the Divine\nauthority rather than to our own judgment, even although perhaps the\nlight of reason should, with the greatest clearness and evidence,\nappear to suggest to us something contrary to what is revealed. But\nin things regarding which there is no revelation, it is by no means\nconsistent with the character of a philosopher to accept as true\nwhat he has not ascertained to be such, and to trust more to the\nsenses, in other words, to the inconsiderate judgments of childhood\nthan to the dictates of mature reason.\nPART II.\nOF THE PRINCIPLES OF MATERIAL THINGS.\nI. The grounds on which the existence of material things may be\nknown with certainty.\nAlthough we are all sufficiently persuaded of the existence of\nmaterial things, yet, since this was before called in question by\nus, and since we reckoned the persuasion of their existence as among\nthe prejudices of our childhood, it is now necessary for us to\ninvestigate the grounds on which this truth may be known with\ncertainty. In the first place, then, it cannot be doubted that every\nperception we have comes to us from some object different from our\nmind; for it is not in our power to cause ourselves to experience\none perception rather than another, the perception being entirely\ndependent on the object which affects our senses. It may, indeed, be\nmatter of inquiry whether that object be God, or something different\nfrom God; but because we perceive, or rather, stimulated by sense,\nclearly and distinctly apprehend, certain matter extended in length,\nbreadth, and thickness, the various parts of which have different\nfigures and motions, and give rise to the sensation we have of\ncolours, smells, pain, etc., God would, without question, deserve to\nbe regarded as a deceiver, if he directly and of himself presented\nto our mind the idea of this extended matter, or merely caused it to\nbe presented to us by some object which possessed neither extension,\nfigure, nor motion. For we clearly conceive this matter as entirely\ndistinct from God, and from ourselves, or our mind; and appear even\nclearly to discern that the idea of it is formed in us on occasion\nof objects existing out of our minds, to which it is in every\nrespect similar. But since God cannot deceive us, for this is\nrepugnant to his nature, as has been already remarked, we must\nunhesitatingly conclude that there exists a certain object extended\nin length, breadth, and thickness, and possessing all those\nproperties which we clearly apprehend to belong to what is extended.\nAnd this extended substance is what we call body or matter.\nII. How we likewise know that the human body is closely connected\nwith the mind.\nWe ought also to conclude that a certain body is more closely united\nto our mind than any other, because we clearly observe that pain and\nother sensations affect us without our foreseeing them; and these,\nthe mind is conscious, do not arise from itself alone, nor pertain\nto it, in so far as it is a thing which thinks, but only in so far\nas it is united to another thing extended and movable, which is\ncalled the human body. But this is not the place to treat in detail\nof this matter.\nIII. That the perceptions of the senses do not teach us what is in\nreality in things, but what is beneficial of hurtful to the\ncomposite whole of mind and body.\nIt will be sufficient to remark that the perceptions of the senses\nare merely to be referred to this intimate union of the human body\nand mind, and that they usually make us aware of what, in external\nobjects, may be useful or adverse to this union, but do not present\nto us these objects as they are in themselves, unless occasionally\nand by accident. For, after this observation, we will without\ndifficulty lay aside the prejudices of the senses, and will have\nrecourse to our understanding alone on this question by reflecting\ncarefully on the ideas implanted in it by nature.\nIV. That the nature of body consists not in weight hardness, colour\nand the like, but in extension alone.\nIn this way we will discern that the nature of matter or body,\nconsidered in general, does not consist in its being hard, or\nponderous, or coloured, or that which affects our senses in any\nother way, but simply in its being a substance extended in length,\nbreadth, and depth. For with respect to hardness, we know nothing of\nit by sense farther than that the parts of hard bodies resist the\nmotion of our hands on coming into contact with them; but if every\ntime our hands moved towards any part, all the bodies in that place\nreceded as quickly as our hands approached, we should never feel\nhardness; and yet we have no reason to believe that bodies which\nmight thus recede would on this account lose that which makes them\nbodies. The nature of body does not, therefore, consist in hardness.\nIn the same way, it may be shown that weight, colour, and all the\nother qualities of this sort, which are perceived in corporeal\nmatter, may be taken from it, itself meanwhile remaining entire: it\nthus follows that the nature of body depends on none of these.\nV. That the truth regarding the nature of body is obscured by the\nopinions respecting rarefaction and a vacuum with which we are pre-\noccupied.\nThere still remain two causes to prevent its being fully admitted\nthat the true nature of body consists in extension alone. The first\nis the prevalent opinion, that most bodies admit of being so\nrarefied and condensed that, when rarefied, they have greater\nextension than when condensed; and some even have subtilized to such\na degree as to make a distinction between the substance of body and\nits quantity, and between quantity itself and extension. The second\ncause is this, that where we conceive only extension in length,\nbreadth, and depth, we are not in the habit of saying that body is\nthere, but only space and further void space, which the generality\nbelieve to be a mere negation.\nVI. In what way rarefaction takes place.\nBut with regard to rarefaction and condensation, whoever gives his\nattention to his own thoughts, and admits nothing of which he is not\nclearly conscious, will not suppose that there is anything in those\nprocesses further than a change of figure in the body rarefied or\ncondensed: so that, in other words, rare bodies are those between\nthe parts of which there are numerous distances filled with other\nbodies; and dense bodies, on the other hand, those whose parts\napproaching each other, either diminish these distances or take them\nwholly away, in the latter of which cases the body is rendered\nabsolutely dense. The body, however, when condensed, has not,\ntherefore, less extension than when the parts embrace a greater\nspace, owing to their removal from each other, and their dispersion\ninto branches. For we ought not to attribute to it the extension of\nthe pores or distances which its parts do not occupy when it is\nrarefied, but to the other bodies that fill these interstices; just\nas when we see a sponge full of water or any other liquid, we do not\nsuppose that each part of the sponge has on this account greater\nextension than when compressed and dry, but only that its pores are\nwider, and therefore that the body is diffused over a larger space.\nVII. That rarefaction cannot be intelligibly explained unless in\nthe way here proposed.\nAnd indeed I am unable to discover the force of the reasons which\nhave induced some to say that rarefaction is the result of the\naugmentation of the quantity of body, rather than to explain it on\nthe principle exemplified in the case of a sponge. For although when\nair or water is rarefied we do not see any of the pores that are\nrendered large, or the new body that is added to occupy them, it is\nyet less agreeable to reason to suppose something that is\nunintelligible for the purpose of giving a verbal and merely\napparent explanation of the rarefaction of bodies, than to conclude,\nbecause of their rarefaction, that there are pores or distances\nbetween the parts which are increased in size, and filled with some\nnew body. Nor ought we to refrain from assenting to this\nexplanation, because we perceive this new body by none of our\nsenses, for there is no reason which obliges us to believe that we\nshould perceive by our senses all the bodies in existence. And we\nsee that it is very easy to explain rarefaction in this manner, but\nimpossible in any other; for, in fine, there would be, as appears to\nme, a manifest contradiction in supposing that any body was\nincreased by a quantity or extension which it had not before,\nwithout the addition to it of a new extended substance, in other\nwords, of another body, because it is impossible to conceive any\naddition of extension or quantity to a thing without supposing the\naddition of a substance having quantity or extension, as will more\nclearly appear from what follows.\nVIII. That quantity and number differ only in thought (RATIONE)\nfrom that which has quantity and is numbered.\nFor quantity differs from extended substance, and number from what\nis numbered, not in reality but merely in our thought; so that, for\nexample, we may consider the whole nature of a corporeal substance\nwhich is comprised in a space of ten feet, although we do not attend\nto this measure of ten feet, for the obvious reason that the thing\nconceived is of the same nature in any part of that space as in the\nwhole; and, on the other hand, we can conceive the number ten, as\nalso a continuous quantity of ten feet, without thinking of this\ndeterminate substance, because the concept of the number ten is\nmanifestly the same whether we consider a number of ten feet or ten\nof anything else; and we can conceive a continuous quantity of ten\nfeet without thinking of this or that determinate substance,\nalthough we cannot conceive it without some extended substance of\nwhich it is the quantity. It is in reality, however, impossible that\nany, even the least part, of such quantity or extension, can be\ntaken away, without the retrenchment at the same time of as much of\nthe substance, nor, on the other hand, can we lessen the substance,\nwithout at the same time taking as much from the quantity or\nextension.\nIX. That corporeal substance, when distinguished from its quantity,\nis confusedly conceived as something incorporeal.\nAlthough perhaps some express themselves otherwise on this matter, I\nam nevertheless convinced that they do not think differently from\nwhat I have now said: for when they distinguish (corporeal)\nsubstance from extension or quantity, they either mean nothing by\nthe word (corporeal) substance, or they form in their minds merely a\nconfused idea of incorporeal substance, which they falsely attribute\nto corporeal, and leave to extension the true idea of this corporeal\nsubstance; which extension they call an accident, but with such\nimpropriety as to make it easy to discover that their words are not\nin harmony with their thoughts.\nX. What space or internal place is.\nSpace or internal place, and the corporeal substance which is\ncomprised in it, are not different in reality, but merely in the\nmode in which they are wont to be conceived by us. For, in truth,\nthe same extension in length, breadth, and depth, which constitutes\nspace, constitutes body; and the difference between them lies only\nin this, that in body we consider extension as particular, and\nconceive it to change with the body; whereas in space we attribute\nto extension a generic unity, so that after taking from a certain\nspace the body which occupied it, we do not suppose that we have at\nthe same time removed the extension of the space, because it appears\nto us that the same extension remains there so long as it is of the\nsame magnitude and figure, and preserves the same situation in\nrespect to certain bodies around it, by means of which we determine\nthis space.\nXI. How space is not in reality different from corporeal substance.\nAnd indeed it will be easy to discern that it is the same extension\nwhich constitutes the nature of body as of space, and that these two\nthings are mutually diverse only as the nature of the genus and\nspecies differs from that of the individual, provided we reflect on\nthe idea we have of any body, taking a stone for example, and reject\nall that is not essential to the nature of body. In the first place,\nthen, hardness may be rejected, because if the stone were liquefied\nor reduced to powder, it would no longer possess hardness, and yet\nwould not cease to be a body; colour also may be thrown out of\naccount, because we have frequently seen stones so transparent as to\nhave no colour; again, we may reject weight, because we have the\ncase of fire, which, though very light, is still a body; and,\nfinally, we may reject cold, heat, and all the other qualities of\nthis sort, either because they are not considered as in the stone,\nor because, with the change of these qualities, the stone is not\nsupposed to have lost the nature of body. After this examination we\nwill find that nothing remains in the idea of body, except that it\nis something extended in length, breadth, and depth; and this\nsomething is comprised in our idea of space, not only of that which\nis full of body, but even of what is called void space.\nXII. How space differs from body in our mode of conceiving it.\nThere is, however, some difference between them in the mode of\nconception; for if we remove a stone from the space or place in\nwhich it was, we conceive that its extension also is taken away,\nbecause we regard this as particular, and inseparable from the stone\nitself: but meanwhile we suppose that the same extension of place in\nwhich this stone was remains, although the place of the stone be\noccupied by wood, water, air, or by any other body, or be even\nsupposed vacant, because we now consider extension in general, and\nthink that the same is common to stones, wood, water, air, and other\nbodies, and even to a vacuum itself, if there is any such thing,\nprovided it be of the same magnitude and figure as before, and\npreserve the same situation among the external bodies which\ndetermine this space.\nXIII. What external place is.\nThe reason of which is, that the words place and space signify\nnothing really different from body which is said to be in place, but\nmerely designate its magnitude, figure, and situation among other\nbodies. For it is necessary, in order to determine this situation,\nto regard certain other bodies which we consider as immovable; and,\naccording as we look to different bodies, we may see that the same\nthing at the same time does and does not change place. For example,\nwhen a vessel is being carried out to sea, a person sitting at the\nstern may be said to remain always in one place, if we look to the\nparts of the vessel, since with respect to these he preserves the\nsame situation; and on the other hand, if regard be had to the\nneighbouring shores, the same person will seem to be perpetually\nchanging place, seeing he is constantly receding from one shore and\napproaching another. And besides, if we suppose that the earth\nmoves, and that it makes precisely as much way from west to east as\nthe vessel from east to west, we will again say that the person at\nthe stern does not change his place, because this place will be\ndetermined by certain immovable points which we imagine to be in the\nheavens. But if at length we are persuaded that there are no points\nreally immovable in the universe, as will hereafter be shown to be\nprobable, we will thence conclude that nothing has a permanent place\nunless in so far as it is fixed by our thought.\nXIV. Wherein place and space differ.\nThe terms place and space, however, differ in signification, because\nplace more expressly designates situation than magnitude or figure,\nwhile, on the other hand, we think of the latter when we speak of\nspace. For we frequently say that a thing succeeds to the place of\nanother, although it be not exactly of the same magnitude or figure;\nbut we do not therefore admit that it occupies the same space as the\nother; and when the situation is changed we say that the place also\nis changed, although there are the same magnitude and figure as\nbefore: so that when we say that a thing is in a particular place,\nwe mean merely that it is situated in a determinate way in respect\nof certain other objects; and when we add that it occupies such a\nspace or place, we understand besides that it is of such determinate\nmagnitude and figure as exactly to fill this space.\nXV. How external place is rightly taken for the superficies of the\nsurrounding body.\nAnd thus we never indeed distinguish space from extension in length,\nbreadth, and depth; we sometimes, however, consider place as in the\nthing placed, and at other times as out of it. Internal place indeed\ndiffers in no way from space; but external place may be taken for\nthe superficies that immediately surrounds the thing placed. It\nought to be remarked that by superficies we do not here understand\nany part of the surrounding body, but only the boundary between the\nsurrounding and surrounded bodies, which is nothing more than a\nmode; or at least that we speak of superficies in general which is\nno part of one body rather than another, but is always considered\nthe same, provided it retain the same magnitude and figure. For\nalthough the whole surrounding body with its superficies were\nchanged, it would not be supposed that the body which was surrounded\nby it had therefore changed its place, if it meanwhile preserved the\nsame situation with respect to the other bodies that are regarded as\nimmovable. Thus, if we suppose that a boat is carried in one\ndirection by the current of a stream, and impelled by the wind in\nthe opposite with an equal force, so that its situation with respect\nto the banks is not changed, we will readily admit that it remains\nin the same place, although the whole superficies which surrounds it\nis incessantly changing.\nXVI. That a vacuum or space in which there is absolutely no body is\nrepugnant to reason.\nWith regard to a vacuum, in the philosophical sense of the term,\nthat is, a space in which there is no substance, it is evident that\nsuch does not exist, seeing the extension of space or internal place\nis not different from that of body. For since from this alone, that\na body has extension in length, breadth, and depth, we have reason\nto conclude that it is a substance, it being absolutely\ncontradictory that nothing should possess extension, we ought to\nform a similar inference regarding the space which is supposed void,\nviz., that since there is extension in it there is necessarily also\nsubstance.\nXVII. That a vacuum in the ordinary use of the term does not\nexclude all body.\nAnd, in truth, by the term vacuum in its common use, we do not mean\na place or space in which there is absolutely nothing, but only a\nplace in which there is none of those things we presume ought to be\nthere. Thus, because a pitcher is made to hold water, it is said to\nbe empty when it is merely filled with air; or if there are no fish\nin a fish-pond, we say there is nothing in it, although it be full\nof water; thus a vessel is said to be empty, when, in place of the\nmerchandise which it was designed to carry, it is loaded with sand\nonly, to enable it to resist the violence of the wind; and, finally,\nit is in the same sense that we say space is void when it contains\nnothing sensible, although it contain created and self-subsisting\nmatter; for we are not in the habit of considering the bodies near\nus, unless in so far as they cause in our organs of sense,\nimpressions strong enough to enable us to perceive them. And if, in\nplace of keeping in mind what ought to be understood by these terms\na vacuum and nothing, we afterwards suppose that in the space we\ncalled a vacuum, there is not only no sensible object, but no object\nat all, we will fall into the same error as if, because a pitcher in\nwhich there is nothing but air, is, in common speech, said to be\nempty, we were therefore to judge that the air contained in it is\nnot a substance (RES SUBSISTENS).\nXVIII. How the prejudice of an absolute vacuum is to be corrected.\nWe have almost all fallen into this error from the earliest age,\nfor, observing that there is no necessary connection between a\nvessel and the body it contains, we thought that God at least could\ntake from a vessel the body which occupied it, without it being\nnecessary that any other should be put in the place of the one\nremoved. But that we may be able now to correct this false opinion,\nit is necessary to remark that there is in truth no connection\nbetween the vessel and the particular body which it contains, but\nthat there is an absolutely necessary connection between the concave\nfigure of the vessel and the extension considered generally which\nmust be comprised in this cavity; so that it is not more\ncontradictory to conceive a mountain without a valley than such a\ncavity without the extension it contains, or this extension apart\nfrom an extended substance, for, as we have often said, of nothing\nthere can be no extension. And accordingly, if it be asked what\nwould happen were God to remove from a vessel all the body contained\nin it, without permitting another body to occupy its place, the\nanswer must be that the sides of the vessel would thus come into\nproximity with each other. For two bodies must touch each other when\nthere is nothing between them, and it is manifestly contradictory\nfor two bodies to be apart, in other words, that there should be a\ndistance between them, and this distance yet be nothing; for all\ndistance is a mode of extension, and cannot therefore exist without\nan extended substance.\nXIX. That this confirms what was said of rarefaction.\nAfter we have thus remarked that the nature of corporeal substance\nconsists only in its being an extended thing, and that its extension\nis not different from that which we attribute to space, however\nempty, it is easy to discover the impossibility of any one of its\nparts in any way whatsoever occupying more space at one time than at\nanother, and thus of being otherwise rarefied than in the way\nexplained above; and it is easy to perceive also that there cannot\nbe more matter or body in a vessel when it is filled with lead or\ngold, or any other body however heavy and hard, than when it but\ncontains air and is supposed to be empty: for the quantity of the\nparts of which a body is composed does not depend on their weight or\nhardness, but only on the extension, which is always equal in the\nsame vase.\nXX. That from this the non-existence of atoms may likewise be\ndemonstrated.\nWe likewise discover that there cannot exist any atoms or parts of\nmatter that are of their own nature indivisible. For however small\nwe suppose these parts to be, yet because they are necessarily\nextended, we are always able in thought to divide any one of them\ninto two or more smaller parts, and may accordingly admit their\ndivisibility. For there is nothing we can divide in thought which we\ndo not thereby recognize to be divisible; and, therefore, were we to\njudge it indivisible our judgment would not be in harmony with the\nknowledge we have of the thing; and although we should even suppose\nthat God had reduced any particle of matter to a smallness so\nextreme that it did not admit of being further divided, it would\nnevertheless be improperly styled indivisible, for though God had\nrendered the particle so small that it was not in the power of any\ncreature to divide it, he could not however deprive himself of the\nability to do so, since it is absolutely impossible for him to\nlessen his own omnipotence, as was before observed. Wherefore,\nabsolutely speaking, the smallest extended particle is always\ndivisible, since it is such of its very nature.\nXXI. It is thus also demonstrated that the extension of the world\nis indefinite.\nWe further discover that this world or the whole (universitas) of\ncorporeal substance, is extended without limit, for wherever we fix\na limit, we still not only imagine beyond it spaces indefinitely\nextended, but perceive these to be truly imaginable, in other words,\nto be in reality such as we imagine them; so that they contain in\nthem corporeal substance indefinitely extended, for, as has been\nalready shown at length, the idea of extension which we conceive in\nany space whatever is plainly identical with the idea of corporeal\nsubstance.\nXXII. It also follows that the matter of the heavens and earth is\nthe same, and that there cannot be a plurality of worlds.\nAnd it may also be easily inferred from all this that the earth and\nheavens are made of the same matter; and that even although there\nwere an infinity of worlds, they would all be composed of this\nmatter; from which it follows that a plurality of worlds is\nimpossible, because we clearly conceive that the matter whose nature\nconsists only in its being an extended substance, already wholly\noccupies all the imaginable spaces where these other worlds could\nalone be, and we cannot find in ourselves the idea of any other\nmatter.\nXXIII. That all the variety of matter, or the diversity of its\nforms, depends on motion.\nThere is therefore but one kind of matter in the whole universe, and\nthis we know only by its being extended. All the properties we\ndistinctly perceive to belong to it are reducible to its capacity of\nbeing divided and moved according to its parts; and accordingly it\nis capable of all those affections which we perceive can arise from\nthe motion of its parts. For the partition of matter in thought\nmakes no change in it; but all variation of it, or diversity of\nform, depends on motion. The philosophers even seem universally to\nhave observed this, for they said that nature was the principle of\nmotion and rest, and by nature they understood that by which all\ncorporeal things become such as they are found in experience.\nXXIV. What motion is, taking the term in its common use.\nBut motion (viz., local, for I can conceive no other kind of motion,\nand therefore I do not think we ought to suppose there is any other\nin nature), in the ordinary sense of the term, is nothing more than\nthe action by which a body passes from one place to another. And\njust as we have remarked above that the same thing may be said to\nchange and not to change place at the same time, so also we may say\nthat the same thing is at the same time moved and not moved. Thus,\nfor example, a person seated in a vessel which is setting sail,\nthinks he is in motion if he look to the shore that he has left, and\nconsider it as fixed; but not if he regard the ship itself, among\nthe parts of which he preserves always the same situation. Moreover,\nbecause we are accustomed to suppose that there is no motion without\naction, and that in rest there is the cessation of action, the\nperson thus seated is more properly said to be at rest than in\nmotion, seeing he is not conscious of being in action.\nXXV. What motion is properly so called.\nBut if, instead of occupying ourselves with that which has no\nfoundation, unless in ordinary usage, we desire to know what ought\nto be understood by motion according to the truth of the thing, we\nmay say, in order to give it a determinate nature, that it is THE\nTRANSPORTING OF ONE PART OF MATTER OR OF ONE BODY FROM THE VICINITY\nOF THOSE BODIES THAT ARE IN IMMEDIATE CONTACT WITH IT, OR WHICH WE\nREGARD AS AT REST, to the vicinity of other bodies. By a body as a\npart of matter, I understand all that which is transferred together,\nalthough it be perhaps composed of several parts, which in\nthemselves have other motions; and I say that it is the transporting\nand not the force or action which transports, with the view of\nshowing that motion is always in the movable thing, not in that\nwhich moves; for it seems to me that we are not accustomed to\ndistinguish these two things with sufficient accuracy. Farther, I\nunderstand that it is a mode of the movable thing, and not a\nsubstance, just as figure is a property of the thing figured, and\nrepose of that which is at rest.\nPART III.\nOF THE VISIBLE WORLD.\nI. That we cannot think too highly of the works of God.\nHaving now ascertained certain principles of material things, which\nwere sought, not by the prejudices of the senses, but by the light\nof reason, and which thus possess so great evidence that we cannot\ndoubt of their truth, it remains for us to consider whether from\nthese alone we can deduce the explication of all the phenomena of\nnature. We will commence with those phenomena that are of the\ngreatest generality, and upon which the others depend, as, for\nexample, with the general structure of this whole visible world. But\nin order to our philosophizing aright regarding this, two things are\nfirst of all to be observed. The first is, that we should ever bear\nin mind the infinity of the power and goodness of God, that we may\nnot fear falling into error by imagining his works to be too great,\nbeautiful, and perfect, but that we may, on the contrary, take care\nlest, by supposing limits to them of which we have no certain\nknowledge, we appear to think less highly than we ought of the power\nof God.\nII. That we ought to beware lest, in our presumption, we imagine\nthat the ends which God proposed to himself in the creation of the\nworld are understood by us.\nThe second is, that we should beware of presuming too highly of\nourselves, as it seems we should do if we supposed certain limits to\nthe world, without being assured of their existence either by\nnatural reasons or by divine revelation, as if the power of our\nthought extended beyond what God has in reality made; but likewise\nstill more if we persuaded ourselves that all things were created by\nGod for us only, or if we merely supposed that we could comprehend\nby the power of our intellect the ends which God proposed to himself\nin creating the universe.\nIII. In what sense it may be said that all things were created for\nthe sake of man.\nFor although, as far as regards morals, it may be a pious thought to\nbelieve that God made all things for us, seeing we may thus be\nincited to greater gratitude and love toward him; and although it is\neven in some sense true, because there is no created thing of which\nwe cannot make some use, if it be only that of exercising our mind\nin considering it, and honouring God on account of it, it is yet by\nno means probable that all things were created for us in this way\nthat God had no other end in their creation; and this supposition\nwould be plainly ridiculous and inept in physical reasoning, for we\ndo not doubt but that many things exist, or formerly existed and\nhave now ceased to be, which were never seen or known by man, and\nwere never of use to him.\nPART IV.\nOF THE EARTH.\nCLXXXVIII. Of what is to be borrowed from disquisitions on animals\nand man to advance the knowledge of material objects.\nI should add nothing farther to this the Fourth Part of the\nPrinciples of Philosophy, did I purpose carrying out my original\ndesign of writing a Fifth and Sixth Part, the one treating of things\npossessed of life, that is, animals and plants, and the other of\nman. But because I have not yet acquired sufficient knowledge of all\nthe matters of which I should desire to treat in these two last\nparts, and do not know whether I shall ever have sufficient leisure\nto finish them, I will here subjoin a few things regarding the\nobjects of our senses, that I may not, for the sake of the latter,\ndelay too long the publication of the former parts, or of what may\nbe desiderated in them, which I might have reserved for explanation\nin those others: for I have hitherto described this earth, and\ngenerally the whole visible world, as if it were merely a machine in\nwhich there was nothing at all to consider except the figures and\nmotions of its parts, whereas our senses present to us many other\nthings, for example colours, smells, sounds, and the like, of which,\nif I did not speak at all, it would be thought I had omitted the\nexplication of the majority of the objects that are in nature.\nCLXXXIX. What perception (SENSUS) is, and how we perceive.\nWe must know, therefore, that although the human soul is united to\nthe whole body, it has, nevertheless, its principal seat in the\nbrain, where alone it not only understands and imagines, but also\nperceives; and this by the medium of the nerves, which are extended\nlike threads from the brain to all the other members, with which\nthey are so connected that we can hardly touch any one of them\nwithout moving the extremities of some of the nerves spread over it;\nand this motion passes to the other extremities of those nerves\nwhich are collected in the brain round the seat of the soul,\n[Footnote: *** FOOTNOTE NOT VISIBLE IN PAGE IMAGE (#98, Text p 195)]\nas I have already explained with sufficient minuteness in the fourth\nchapter of the Dioptrics. But the movements which are thus excited\nin the brain by the nerves variously affect the soul or mind, which\nis intimately conjoined with the brain, according to the diversity\nof the motions themselves. And the diverse affections of the mind or\nthoughts that immediately arise from these motions, are called\nperceptions of the senses (SENSUUM PERCEPTIONES), or, as we commonly\nspeak, sensations (SENSUS).\nCXC. Of the distinction of the senses; and, first, of the internal,\nthat is, of the affections of the mind (passions), and the natural\nappetites.\nThe varieties of these sensations depend, firstly, on the diversity\nof the nerves themselves, and, secondly, of the movements that are\nmade in each nerve. We have not, however, as many different senses\nas there are nerves. We can distinguish but seven principal classes\nof nerves, of which two belong to the internal, and the other five\nto the external senses. The nerves which extend to the stomach, the\noesophagus, the fauces, and the other internal parts that are\nsubservient to our natural wants, constitute one of our internal\nsenses. This is called the natural appetite (APPETITUS NATURALIS).\nThe other internal sense, which embraces all the emotions\n(COMMOTIONES) of the mind or passions, and affections, as joy,\nsadness, love, hate, and the like, depends upon the nerves which\nextend to the heart and the parts about the heart, and are\nexceedingly small; for, by way of example, when the blood happens to\nbe pure and well tempered, so that it dilates in the heart more\nreadily and strongly than usual, this so enlarges and moves the\nsmall nerves scattered around the orifices, that there is thence a\ncorresponding movement in the brain, which affects the mind with a\ncertain natural feeling of joy; and as often as these same nerves\nare moved in the same way, although this is by other causes, they\nexcite in our mind the same feeling (sensus, sentiment). Thus, the\nimagination of the enjoyment of a good does not contain in itself\nthe feeling of joy, but it causes the animal spirits to pass from\nthe brain to the muscles in which these nerves are inserted; and\nthus dilating the orifices of the heart, it also causes these small\nnerves to move in the way appointed by nature to afford the\nsensation of joy. Thus, when we receive news, the mind first of all\njudges of it, and if the news be good, it rejoices with that\nintellectual joy (GAUDIUM INTELLECTUALE) which is independent of any\nemotion (COMMOTIO) of the body, and which the Stoics did not deny to\ntheir wise man [although they supposed him exempt from all passion].\nBut as soon as this joy passes from the understanding to the\nimagination, the spirits flow from the brain to the muscles that are\nabout the heart, and there excite the motion of the small nerves, by\nmeans of which another motion is caused in the brain, which affects\nthe mind with the sensation of animal joy (LAETITIA ANIMALIS). On\nthe same principle, when the blood is so thick that it flows but\nsparingly into the ventricles of the heart, and is not there\nsufficiently dilated, it excites in the same nerves a motion quite\ndifferent from the preceding, which, communicated to the brain,\ngives to the mind the sensation of sadness, although the mind itself\nis perhaps ignorant of the cause of its sadness. And all the other\ncauses which move these nerves in the same way may also give to the\nmind the same sensation. But the other movements of the same nerves\nproduce other effects, as the feelings of love, hate, fear, anger,\netc., as far as they are merely affections or passions of the mind;\nin other words, as far as they are confused thoughts which the mind\nhas not from itself alone, but from its being closely joined to the\nbody, from which it receives impressions; for there is the widest\ndifference between these passions and the distinct thoughts which we\nhave of what ought to be loved, or chosen, or shunned, etc.,\n[although these are often enough found together]. The natural\nappetites, as hunger, thirst, and the others, are likewise\nsensations excited in the mind by means of the nerves of the\nstomach, fauces, and other parts, and are entirely different from\nthe will which we have to eat, drink, [and to do all that which we\nthink proper for the conservation of our body]; but, because this\nwill or appetition almost always accompanies them, they are\ntherefore named appetites.\nCXCI. Of the external senses; and first of touch.\nWe commonly reckon the external senses five in number, because there\nare as many different kinds of objects which move the nerves and\ntheir organs, and an equal number of kinds of confused thoughts\nexcited in the soul by these emotions. In the first place, the\nnerves terminating in the skin of the whole body can be touched\nthrough this medium by any terrene objects whatever, and moved by\nthese wholes, in one way by their hardness, in another by their\ngravity, in a third by their heat, in a fourth by their humidity,\netc.--and in as many diverse modes as they are either moved or\nhindered from their ordinary motion, to that extent are diverse\nsensations excited in the mind, from which a corresponding number of\ntactile qualities derive their appellations. Besides this, when\nthese nerves are moved a little more powerfully than usual, but not\nnevertheless to the degree by which our body is in any way hurt,\nthere thus arises a sensation of titillation, which is naturally\nagreeable to the mind, because it testifies to it of the powers of\nthe body with which it is joined, [in that the latter can suffer the\naction causing this titillation, without being hurt]. But if this\naction be strong enough to hurt our body in any way, this gives to\nour mind the sensation of pain. And we thus see why corporeal\npleasure and pain, although sensations of quite an opposite\ncharacter, arise nevertheless from causes nearly alike.\nCXCII. Of taste.\nIn the second place, the other nerves scattered over the tongue and\nthe parts in its vicinity are diversely moved by the particles of\nthe same bodies, separated from each other and floating in the\nsaliva in the mouth, and thus cause sensations of diverse tastes\naccording to the diversity of figure in these particles. [Footnote:\nIn the French this section begins, \"Taste, after touch the grossest\nof the senses,\" etc.]\nCXCIII. Of smell.\nThirdly, two nerves also or appendages of the brain, for they do not\ngo beyond the limits of the skull, are moved by the particles of\nterrestrial bodies, separated and flying in the air, not indeed by\nall particles indifferently, but by those only that are sufficiently\nsubtle and penetrating to enter the pores of the bone we call the\nspongy, when drawn into the nostrils, and thus to reach the nerves.\nFrom the different motions of these particles arise the sensations\nof the different smells.\nCXCIV. Of hearing.\nFourthly, there are two nerves within the ears, so attached to three\nsmall bones that are mutually sustaining, and the first of which\nrests on the small membrane that covers the cavity we call the\ntympanum of the ear, that all the diverse vibrations which the\nsurrounding air communicates to this membrane are transmitted to the\nmind by these nerves, and these vibrations give rise, according to\ntheir diversity, to the sensations of the different sounds.\nCXCV. Of sight.\nFinally, the extremities of the optic nerves, composing the coat in\nthe eyes called the retina, are not moved by the air nor by any\nterrestrial object, but only by the globules of the second element,\nwhence we have the sense of light and colours: as I have already at\nsufficient length explained in the Dioptrics and treatise of\nMeteors. [Footnote: In the French this section begins, \"Finally,\nsight is the most subtle of all the senses,\" etc.]\nCXCVI. That the soul perceives only in so far as it is in the\nbrain.\nIt is clearly established, however, that the soul does not perceive\nin so far as it is in each member of the body, but only in so far as\nit is in the brain, where the nerves by their movements convey to it\nthe diverse actions of the external objects that touch the parts of\nthe body in which they are inserted. For, in the first place, there\nare various maladies, which, though they affect the brain alone, yet\nbring disorder upon, or deprive us altogether of the use of, our\nsenses, just as sleep, which affects the brain only, and yet takes\nfrom us daily during a great part of our time the faculty of\nperception, which afterwards in our waking state is restored to us.\nThe second proof is, that though there be no disease in the brain,\n[or in the members in which the organs of the external senses are],\nit is nevertheless sufficient to take away sensation from the part\nof the body where the nerves terminate, if only the movement of one\nof the nerves that extend from the brain to these members be\nobstructed in any part of the distance that is between the two. And\nthe last proof is, that we sometimes feel pain as if in certain of\nour members, the cause of which, however, is not in these members\nwhere it is felt, but somewhere nearer the brain, through which the\nnerves pass that give to the mind the sensation of it. I could\nestablish this fact by innumerable experiments; I will here,\nhowever, merely refer to one of them. A girl suffering from a bad\nulcer in the hand, had her eyes bandaged whenever the surgeon came\nto visit her, not being able to bear the sight of the dressing of\nthe sore; and, the gangrene having spread, after the expiry of a few\ndays the arm was amputated from the elbow [without the girl's\nknowledge]; linen cloths tied one above the other were substituted\nin place of the part amputated, so that she remained for some time\nwithout knowing that the operation had been performed, and meanwhile\nshe complained of feeling various pains, sometimes in one finger of\nthe hand that was cut off, and sometimes in another. The only\nexplanation of this is, that the nerves which before stretched\ndownwards from the brain to the hand, and then terminated in the arm\nclose to the elbow, were there moved in the same way as they\nrequired to be moved before in the hand for the purpose of\nimpressing on the mind residing in the brain the sensation of pain\nin this or that finger. [And this clearly shows that the pain of the\nhand is not felt by the mind in so far as it is in the hand, but in\nso far as it is in the brain.]\nCXCVII. That the nature of the mind is such that from the motion\nalone of body the various sensations can be excited in it.\nIn the next place, it can be proved that our mind is of such a\nnature that the motions of the body alone are sufficient to excite\nin it all sorts of thoughts, without it being necessary that these\nshould in any way resemble the motions which give rise to them, and\nespecially that these motions can excite in it those confused\nthoughts called sensations (SENSUS, SENSATIONES). For we see that\nwords, whether uttered by the voice or merely written, excite in our\nminds all kinds of thoughts and emotions. On the same paper, with\nthe same pen and ink, by merely moving the point of the pen over the\npaper in a particular way, we can trace letters that will raise in\nthe minds of our readers the thoughts of combats, tempests, or the\nfuries, and the passions of indignation and sorrow; in place of\nwhich, if the pen be moved in another way hardly different from the\nformer, this slight change will cause thoughts widely different from\nthe above, such as those of repose, peace, pleasantness, and the\nquite opposite passions of love and joy. Some one will perhaps\nobject that writing and speech do not immediately excite in the mind\nany passions, or imaginations of things different from the letters\nand sounds, but afford simply the knowledge of these, on occasion of\nwhich the mind, understanding the signification of the words,\nafterwards excites in itself the imaginations and passions that\ncorrespond to the words. But what will be said of the sensations of\npain and titillation? The motion merely of a sword cutting a part of\nour skin causes pain, [but does not on that account make us aware of\nthe motion or figure of the sword]. And it is certain that this\nsensation of pain is not less different from the motion that causes\nit, or from that of the part of our body which the sword cuts, than\nare the sensations we have of colour, sound, odour, or taste. On\nthis ground we may conclude that our mind is of such a nature that\nthe motions alone of certain bodies can also easily excite in it all\nthe other sensations, as the motion of a sword excites in it the\nsensation of pain.\nCXCVIII. That by our senses we know nothing of external objects\nbeyond their figure [or situation], magnitude, and motion.\nBesides, we observe no such difference between the nerves as to lead\nus to judge that one set of them convey to the brain from the organs\nof the external senses anything different from another, or that\nanything at all reaches the brain besides the local motion of the\nnerves themselves. And we see that local motion alone causes in us\nnot only the sensation of titillation and of pain, but also of light\nand sounds. For if we receive a blow on the eye of sufficient force\nto cause the vibration of the stroke to reach the retina, we see\nnumerous sparks of fire, which, nevertheless, are not out of our\neye; and when we stop our ear with our finger, we hear a humming\nsound, the cause of which can only proceed from the agitation of the\nair that is shut up within it. Finally, we frequently observe that\nheat [hardness, weight], and the other sensible qualities, as far as\nthey are in objects, and also the forms of those bodies that are\npurely material, as, for example, the forms of fire, are produced in\nthem by the motion of certain other bodies, and that these in their\nturn likewise produce other motions in other bodies. And we can\neasily conceive how the motion of one body may be caused by that of\nanother, and diversified by the size, figure, and situation of its\nparts, but we are wholly unable to conceive how these same things\n(viz., size, figure, and motion), can produce something else of a\nnature entirely different from themselves, as, for example, those\nsubstantial forms and real qualities which many philosophers suppose\nto be in bodies; nor likewise can we conceive how these qualities or\nforms possess force to cause motions in other bodies. But since we\nknow, from the nature of our soul, that the diverse motions of body\nare sufficient to produce in it all the sensations which it has, and\nsince we learn from experience that several of its sensations are in\nreality caused by such motions, while we do not discover that\nanything besides these motions ever passes from the organs of the\nexternal senses to the brain, we have reason to conclude that we in\nno way likewise apprehend that in external objects, which we call\nlight, colour, smell, taste, sound, heat or cold, and the other\ntactile qualities, or that which we call their substantial forms,\nunless as the various dispositions of these objects which have the\npower of moving our nerves in various ways. [Footnote: \"the diverse\nfigures, situations, magnitudes, and motions of their parts.\"--\nFrench.]\nCXCIX. That there is no phenomenon of nature whose explanation has\nbeen omitted in this treatise.\nAnd thus it may be gathered, from an enumeration that is easily\nmade, that there is no phenomenon of nature whose explanation has\nbeen omitted in this treatise; for beyond what is perceived by the\nsenses, there is nothing that can be considered a phenomenon of\nnature. But leaving out of account motion, magnitude, figure, [and\nthe situation of the parts of each body], which I have explained as\nthey exist in body, we perceive nothing out of us by our senses\nexcept light, colours, smells, tastes, sounds, and the tactile\nqualities; and these I have recently shown to be nothing more, at\nleast so far as they are known to us, than certain dispositions of\nthe objects, consisting in magnitude, figure, and motion.\nCC. That this treatise contains no principles which are not\nuniversally received; and that this philosophy is not new, but of\nall others the most ancient and common.\nBut I am desirous also that it should be observed that, though I\nhave here endeavoured to give an explanation of the whole nature of\nmaterial things, I have nevertheless made use of no principle which\nwas not received and approved by Aristotle, and by the other\nphilosophers of all ages; so that this philosophy, so far from being\nnew, is of all others the most ancient and common: for I have in\ntruth merely considered the figure, motion, and magnitude of bodies,\nand examined what must follow from their mutual concourse on the\nprinciples of mechanics, which are confirmed by certain and daily\nexperience. But no one ever doubted that bodies are moved, and that\nthey are of various sizes and figures, according to the diversity of\nwhich their motions also vary, and that from mutual collision those\nsomewhat greater than others are divided into many smaller, and thus\nchange figure. We have experience of the truth of this, not merely\nby a single sense, but by several, as touch, sight, and hearing: we\nalso distinctly imagine and understand it. This cannot be said of\nany of the other things that fall under our senses, as colours,\nsounds, and the like; for each of these affects but one of our\nsenses, and merely impresses upon our imagination a confused image\nof itself, affording our understanding no distinct knowledge of what\nit is.\nCCI. That sensible bodies are composed of insensible particles.\nBut I allow many particles in each body that are perceived by none\nof our senses, and this will not perhaps be approved of by those who\ntake the senses for the measure of the knowable. [We greatly wrong\nhuman reason, however, as appears to me, if we suppose that it does\nnot go beyond the eye-sight]; for no one can doubt that there are\nbodies so small as not to be perceptible by any of our senses,\nprovided he only consider what is each moment added to those bodies\nthat are being increased little by little, and what is taken from\nthose that are diminished in the same way. A tree increases daily,\nand it is impossible to conceive how it becomes greater than it was\nbefore, unless we at the same time conceive that some body is added\nto it. But who ever observed by the senses those small bodies that\nare in one day added to a tree while growing? Among the philosophers\nat least, those who hold that quantity is indefinitely divisible,\nought to admit that in the division the parts may become so small as\nto be wholly imperceptible. And indeed it ought not to be a matter\nof surprise, that we are unable to perceive very minute bodies; for\nthe nerves that must be moved by objects to cause perception are not\nthemselves very minute, but are like small cords, being composed of\na quantity of smaller fibres, and thus the most minute bodies are\nnot capable of moving them. Nor do I think that any one who makes\nuse of his reason will deny that we philosophize with much greater\ntruth when we judge of what takes place in those small bodies which\nare imperceptible from their minuteness only, after the analogy of\nwhat we see occurring in those we do perceive, [and in this way\nexplain all that is in nature, as I have essayed to do in this\ntreatise], than when we give an explanation of the same things by\ninventing I know not what novelties, that have no relation to the\nthings we actually perceive, [as first matter, substantial forms,\nand all that grand array of qualities which many are in the habit of\nsupposing, each of which is more difficult to comprehend than all\nthat is professed to be explained by means of them].\nCCII. That the philosophy of Democritus is not less different from\nours than from the common. [Footnote: \"that of Aristotle or the\nothers.\"--French.]\nBut it may be said that Democritus also supposed certain corpuscles\nthat were of various figures, sizes, and motions, from the heaping\ntogether and mutual concourse of which all sensible bodies arose;\nand, nevertheless, his mode of philosophizing is commonly rejected\nby all. To this I reply that the philosophy of Democritus was never\nrejected by any one, because he allowed the existence of bodies\nsmaller than those we perceive, and attributed to them diverse\nsizes, figures, and motions, for no one can doubt that there are in\nreality such, as we have already shown; but it was rejected, in the\nfirst place, because he supposed that these corpuscles were\nindivisible, on which ground I also reject it; in the second place,\nbecause he imagined there was a vacuum about them, which I show to\nbe impossible; thirdly, because he attributed gravity to these\nbodies, of which I deny the existence in any body, in so far as a\nbody is considered by itself, because it is a quality that depends\non the relations of situation and motion which several bodies bear\nto each other; and, finally, because he has not explained in\nparticular how all things arose from the concourse of corpuscles\nalone, or, if he gave this explanation with regard to a few of them,\nhis whole reasoning was far from being coherent, [or such as would\nwarrant us in extending the same explanation to the whole of\nnature]. This, at least, is the verdict we must give regarding his\nphilosophy, if we may judge of his opinions from what has been\nhanded down to us in writing. I leave it to others to determine\nwhether the philosophy I profess possesses a valid coherency, [and\nwhether on its principles we can make the requisite number of\ndeductions; and, inasmuch as the consideration of figure, magnitude,\nand motion has been admitted by Aristotle and by all the others, as\nwell as by Democritus, and since I reject all that the latter has\nsupposed, with this single exception, while I reject generally all\nthat has been supposed by the others, it is plain that this mode of\nphilosophizing has no more affinity with that of Democritus than of\nany other particular sect].\nCCIII. How we may arrive at the knowledge of the figures,\n[magnitudes], and motions of the insensible particles of bodies.\nBut, since I assign determinate figures, magnitudes, and motions to\nthe insensible particles of bodies, as if I had seen them, whereas I\nadmit that they do not fall under the senses, some one will perhaps\ndemand how I have come by my knowledge of them. [To this I reply,\nthat I first considered in general all the clear and distinct\nnotions of material things that are to be found in our\nunderstanding, and that, finding no others except those of figures,\nmagnitudes, and motions, and of the rules according to which these\nthree things can be diversified by each other, which rules are the\nprinciples of geometry and mechanics, I judged that all the\nknowledge man can have of nature must of necessity be drawn from\nthis source; because all the other notions we have of sensible\nthings, as confused and obscure, can be of no avail in affording us\nthe knowledge of anything out of ourselves, but must serve rather to\nimpede it]. Thereupon, taking as my ground of inference the simplest\nand best known of the principles that have been implanted in our\nminds by nature, I considered the chief differences that could\npossibly subsist between the magnitudes, and figures, and situations\nof bodies insensible on account of their smallness alone, and what\nsensible effects could be produced by their various modes of coming\ninto contact; and afterwards, when I found like effects in the\nbodies that we perceive by our senses, I judged that they could have\nbeen thus produced, especially since no other mode of explaining\nthem could be devised. And in this matter the example of several\nbodies made by art was of great service to me: for I recognize no\ndifference between these and natural bodies beyond this, that the\neffects of machines depend for the most part on the agency of\ncertain instruments, which, as they must bear some proportion to the\nhands of those who make them, are always so large that their figures\nand motions can be seen; in place of which, the effects of natural\nbodies almost always depend upon certain organs so minute as to\nescape our senses. And it is certain that all the rules of mechanics\nbelong also to physics, of which it is a part or species, [so that\nall that is artificial is withal natural]: for it is not less\nnatural for a clock, made of the requisite number of wheels, to mark\nthe hours, than for a tree, which has sprung from this or that seed,\nto produce the fruit peculiar to it. Accordingly, just as those who\nare familiar with automata, when they are informed of the use of a\nmachine, and see some of its parts, easily infer from these the way\nin which the others, that are not seen by them, are made; so from\nconsidering the sensible effects and parts of natural bodies, I have\nessayed to determine the character of their causes and insensible\nparts.\nCCIV. That, touching the things which our senses do not perceive,\nit is sufficient to explain how they can be, [and that this is all\nthat Aristotle has essayed].\nBut here some one will perhaps reply, that although I have supposed\ncauses which could produce all natural objects, we ought not on this\naccount to conclude that they were produced by these causes; for,\njust as the same artisan can make two clocks, which, though they\nboth equally well indicate the time, and are not different in\noutward appearance, have nevertheless nothing resembling in the\ncomposition of their wheels; so doubtless the Supreme Maker of\nthings has an infinity of diverse means at his disposal, by each of\nwhich he could have made all the things of this world to appear as\nwe see them, without it being possible for the human mind to know\nwhich of all these means he chose to employ. I most freely concede\nthis; and I believe that I have done all that was required, if the\ncauses I have assigned are such that their effects accurately\ncorrespond to all the phenomena of nature, without determining\nwhether it is by these or by others that they are actually produced.\nAnd it will be sufficient for the use of life to know the causes\nthus imagined, for medicine, mechanics, and in general all the arts\nto which the knowledge of physics is of service, have for their end\nonly those effects that are sensible, and that are accordingly to be\nreckoned among the phenomena of nature. [Footnote: \"have for their\nend only to apply certain sensible bodies to each other in such a\nway that, in the course of natural causes, certain sensible effects\nmay be produced; and we will be able to accomplish this quite as\nwell by considering the series of certain causes thus imagined,\nalthough false, as if they were the true, since this series is\nsupposed similar as far as regards sensible effects.\"-French.]\nAnd lest it should be supposed that Aristotle did, or professed to\ndo, anything more than this, it ought to be remembered that he\nhimself expressly says, at the commencement of the seventh chapter\nof the first book of the Meteorologies, that, with regard to things\nwhich are not manifest to the senses, he thinks to adduce sufficient\nreasons and demonstrations of them, if he only shows that they may\nbe such as he explains them. [Footnote: words in Greek]\nCCV. That nevertheless there is a moral certainty that all the\nthings of this world are such as has been here shown they may be.\nBut nevertheless, that I may not wrong the truth by supposing it\nless certain than it is, I will here distinguish two kinds of\ncertitude. The first is called moral, that is, a certainty\nsufficient for the conduct of life, though, if we look to the\nabsolute power of God, what is morally certain may be false. [Thus,\nthose who never visited Rome do not doubt that it is a city of\nItaly, though it might be that all from whom they got their\ninformation were deceived]. Again, if any one, wishing to decipher a\nletter written in Latin characters that are not placed in regular\norder, bethinks himself of reading a B wherever an A is found, and a\nC wherever there is a B, and thus of substituting in place of each\nletter the one which follows it in the order of the alphabet, and if\nby this means he finds that there are certain Latin words composed\nof these, he will not doubt that the true meaning of the writing is\ncontained in these words, although he may discover this only by\nconjecture, and although it is possible that the writer of it did\nnot arrange the letters on this principle of alphabetical order, but\non some other, and thus concealed another meaning in it: for this is\nso improbable [especially when the cipher contains a number of\nwords] as to seem incredible. But they who observe how many things\nregarding the magnet, fire, and the fabric of the whole world, are\nhere deduced from a very small number of principles, though they\ndeemed that I had taken them up at random and without grounds, will\nyet perhaps acknowledge that it could hardly happen that so many\nthings should cohere if these principles were false.\nCCVI. That we possess even more than a moral certainty of it.\nBesides, there are some, even among natural, things which we judge\nto be absolutely certain. [Absolute certainty arises when we judge\nthat it is impossible a thing can be otherwise than as we think it].\nThis certainty is founded on the metaphysical ground, that, as God\nis supremely good and the source of all truth, the faculty of\ndistinguishing truth from error which he gave us, cannot be\nfallacious so long as we use it aright, and distinctly perceive\nanything by it. Of this character are the demonstrations of\nmathematics, the knowledge that material things exist, and the clear\nreasonings that are formed regarding them. The results I have given\nin this treatise will perhaps be admitted to a place in the class of\ntruths that are absolutely certain, if it be considered that they\nare deduced in a continuous series from the first and most\nelementary principles of human knowledge; especially if it be\nsufficiently understood that we can perceive no external objects\nunless some local motion be caused by them in our nerves, and that\nsuch motion cannot be caused by the fixed stars, owing to their\ngreat distance from us, unless a motion be also produced in them and\nin the whole heavens lying between them and us: for these points\nbeing admitted, all the others, at least the more general doctrines\nwhich I have advanced regarding the world or earth [e. g., the\nfluidity of the heavens, Part III., Section XLVI.], will appear to\nbe almost the only possible explanations of the phenomena they\npresent.\nCCVII. That, however, I submit all my opinions to the authority of\nthe church.\nNevertheless, lest I should presume too far, I affirm nothing, but\nsubmit all these my opinions to the authority of the church and the\njudgment of the more sage; and I desire no one to believe anything I\nmay have said, unless he is constrained to admit it by the force and\nevidence of reason.", "source": "principles.txt"}
