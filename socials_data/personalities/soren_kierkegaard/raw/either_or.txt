Diapsalmata

What is a poet? An unhappy man who in his heart harbors a deep anguish, but whose lips are so fashioned that the sighs and cries which pass over them are transformed into ravishing music. His fate is like that of the unfortunate victims whom the tyrant Phalaris imprisoned in a brazen bull, and slowly tortured over a steady fire; their cries could not reach the tyrant's ears so as to strike terror into his heart; when they reached his ears they sounded like sweet music.

I do not care for anything. I do not care to ride, for the exercise is too violent. I do not care to walk, it is too strenuous. I do not care to lie down, for I should either have to remain lying, and I do not care to do that, or I should have to get up again, and I do not care to do that either. Summa summarum: I do not care at all.

There are, as is known, insects that die in the moment of fertilization. So it is with all joy: life's highest, most splendid moment of enjoyment is accompanied by death.

My life is like an eternal night; when will the day dawn? When will the sun rise?

How empty is life! empty and without meaning. We bury a man; we follow him to the grave, we throw three spadefuls of earth over him; we ride out to the cemetery in a carriage, we ride home in a carriage; we take comfort in the thought that a long life lies before us. How long is seven times ten years? Why do we not finish it at once, why do we stay?

My soul is like the Dead Sea: heavy, bitter, and unable to support any living thing.

I have the courage, I believe, to doubt everything; I have the courage, I believe, to fight with everything; but I have not the courage to know anything, not the courage to possess, to own anything. Most people complain that the world is so prosaic, that life is not like a romance, where opportunities are always so favorable. I complain that life is not like a romance, where one has hard-hearted parents and nixies and trolls to fight, and enchanted princesses to free. What are all such enemies taken together, compared with the pale, bloodless, tenacious, nocturnal shapes with which I fight and to which I give life and being even while I destroy them.

Let others complain that the age is wicked; my complaint is that it is paltry; for it lacks passion. Men’s thoughts are thin and flimsy like lace, they are themselves pitiable like the lacemakers. The thoughts of their hearts are too paltry to be sinful. For a worm it might be regarded as a sin to harbor such thoughts, but not for a being made in the image of God. Their lusts are dull and sluggish, their passions sleepy. They do their duty, these shopkeeping souls, but they clip the coin a little...

Rotation of Crops

People with experience maintain that proceeding from a basic principle is the supposed method of all science. Now, if this is true, and if it is also true that they who do not start from a beginning arrive at no conclusion, then it is clear that I, who have no beginning, can never arrive at a conclusion. Fortunately, I am not in the least concerned about this...

The result of the whole argument is therefore that boredom is the root of all evil. It is very curious that boredom, which itself has such a calm and sedate nature, can have such a capacity to initiate motion. The effect of boredom is usually strongest when it is least expected.

The method I propose does not consist in sowing grain and reaping the harvest, but in the rotation of crops. The principle of the rotation of crops is typically interpreted in a rather vulgar sense, as simply changing the field or the crop. But the true rotation of crops consists in changing the method of cultivation and the kind of grain. Here we have at once the principle of limitation. The more you limit yourself, the more fertile you become in invention.
