Preface

Not only in the world of commerce but also in the world of ideas our age
is putting on a veritable clearance sale. Everything can be had so dirt
cheap that one begins to wonder whether in the end anyone will want to
make a bid. Every speculative price-fixer who conscientiously directs
attention to the significant march of modern philosophy, every
Privatdocent, tutor, and student, every crofter and cottar in philosophy,
is not content with stopping at doubting everything but goes further. It
might be untimely and ill-timed to ask them where they are going, but it
is no doubt permissible to assume that they have doubted everything, since
otherwise it would be queer to say that they were going further. This
preliminary movement they have therefore all completed, and presumably
with such ease that they do not think it necessary to waste a word about
how they did it; for not even he who anxiously and with deep concern
sought a little enlightenment in the renowned march of modern philosophy,
not even he was lucky enough to learn how one doubts, perhaps because one
did not account it to him for righteousness that he did not go further,
so that he, the poor wretch, became a laughing-stock to all, to the
mighty men who hasten on, and to the stutterers who trot behind, because
he refused to chirp with the little flock which says "and so further,"
but rather wanted to fix his attention upon one thought, which, if it is
actually thought, might well be enough for a whole life.

...

The present author is by no means a philosopher. He is, poetice et
eleganter [in a poetic and refined way], a freelance writer who neither
writes the system nor gives promises of the system, who neither subscribes
to the system nor ascribes anything to it. He writes because to him it is
a luxury that is all the more pleasant and apparent the fewer there are
who buy and read what he writes. He can easily foresee his fate in an
age when passion has been obliterated in favor of science, in an age
when an author who wants to have readers must take care to write in such
a way that the book can easily be perused during the afternoon nap, and
take care to be like the polite gardener in the advertisement, who with
hat in hand and a good certificate from the last place he worked offers
his services to the honored public. He foresees his fate--to be entirely
ignored; he has a terrible foreboding that eager zeal for criticism will
many a time chop him up to find ... the system. He hopes that this will
be the worst thing that happens to the book. But if it does happen, he
also hopes that the kind and benevolent reader (to whom the book is
addressed) will be of good cheer and not let himself be seduced by
criticism to give up his reading, but rather will say as the child said
when the book had been chopped up: "It was a shame to cut it up, it would
have been a nice place to put the pieces."

...

Faith is precisely this paradox, that the single individual is higher
than the universal, yet in such a way, be it observed, that the movement
repeats itself, and that consequently the single individual, after having
been in the universal, now as the single individual isolates himself as
higher than the universal. If this is not faith, then Abraham is lost,
then faith has never existed in the world... because it has always
existed. For if the ethical (i.e., the moral) is the highest thing, and if
nothing incommensurable remains in man in any other way but as the evil
(i.e., the particular which has to be expressed in the universal), then
one needs no other categories than those which the Greek philosophers
possessed or which can be deduced from them by consistent thought. This
is something that Hegel should not have concealed, for, after all, he was
acquainted with Greek philosophy.

...

Infinite resignation is the last stage prior to faith, so that one who
has not made this movement has not faith; for only in the infinite
resignation do I become clear to myself with respect to my eternal
validity, and only then can there be any question of grasping existence
by virtue of faith.

...

The knights of the infinite resignation are easily recognized: their
gait is gliding and assured. Those on the other hand who carry the jewel
of faith are likely to be delusive, because their outward appearance
bears a striking resemblance to that which both the infinite resignation
and faith exclude, often with scrupulous care, namely, Philistinism.

...

I candidly admit that in my practice I have not found any reliable
example of the knight of faith, though I would not deny that every second
man may be such an example. I have been trying, however, for several years
to get on the track of this, and all in vain. People commonly travel
around the world to see rivers and mountains, new stars, birds of rare
plumage, queerly deformed fishes, ridiculous races of men--they abandon
themselves to the bestial stupor which gapes at existence, and they think
they have seen something. This does not interest me. But if I knew where
there was such a knight of faith, I would make a pilgrimage to him on
foot, for this prodigy interests me absolutely. I would not let him go
for an instant, every moment I would watch to see how he managed to make
the movements, I would regard myself as secured for life, and would divide
my time between looking at him and practicing the exercises myself, and
thus would spend all my time admiring him.
