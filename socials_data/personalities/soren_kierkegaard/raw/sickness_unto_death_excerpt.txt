Despair is the sickness unto death. The torment of despair is precisely this: not to be able to die. So it has much in common with the situation of the dying man when he lies and struggles with death, and cannot die. So to be sick unto death is, not to be able to die--yet not as though there were hope of life; no, the hopelessness is that there is not even the ultimate hope, death. When death is the greatest danger, one hopes for life; but when one has an acquaintance with the terrible infinity of being, and is locked up in it, one hopes for death.
