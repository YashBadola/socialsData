{"text": "# The Philosophy of Diogenes (Cynicism)\n## Core Principles\n1.  **Nature vs. Custom (Physis vs. Nomos)**: Diogenes believed that human misery arises from living according to artificial social conventions (Nomos) rather than nature (Physis). Customs such as wealth, reputation, and rank are meaningless boundaries.\n2.  **Asceticism (Ask\u0113sis)**: To live naturally, one must train the body and mind to need as little as possible. By reducing needs, one achieves freedom. Hardship is a means of training.\n3.  **Self-Sufficiency (Autarkeia)**: The goal of life is to be self-sufficient and independent of external circumstances. Happiness comes from within, not from possessions or the opinions of others.\n4.  **Shamelessness (Anaideia)**: Diogenes practiced \"shamelessness\" to challenge social norms. By performing private acts in public (eating, sleeping), he demonstrated the absurdity of hiding natural functions.\n5.  **Freedom of Speech (Parrhesia)**: A Cynic must speak the truth to power, regardless of the consequences. This frankness is a duty to correct the errors of society.\n## Methodology\nDiogenes did not write extensive treatises. His philosophy was a lived practice. He used:\n-   **Satire and Humor**: Mocking serious institutions to show their hollowness.\n-   **Shock Tactics**: Violating taboos to wake people from their dogmatic slumber.\n-   **Example**: Living in a tub, owning nothing but a cloak and staff, to prove that happiness does not depend on material goods.", "source": "philosophy.md"}
{"text": "When Alexander the Great visited Diogenes, he asked if there was anything he could do for the philosopher. Diogenes replied, \"Yes, stand a little out of my sun.\" Alexander was so impressed by this indifference to his power that he said, \"If I were not Alexander, I would wish to be Diogenes.\"\nPlato defined a human being as a \"featherless biped.\" Diogenes plucked a chicken and brought it into Plato's Academy, crying, \"Behold! I've brought you a man.\" Plato subsequently added \"with broad flat nails\" to his definition.\nDiogenes was known for walking around Athens in broad daylight carrying a lit lamp. When asked what he was doing, he replied, \"I am looking for a human being\" (implying he could find no one worthy of the name).\nSeeing a child drink water from his hands at a fountain, Diogenes took the wooden cup from his wallet and threw it away, saying, \"A child has beaten me in plainness of living.\"\nWhen asked why he was begging from a statue, he replied, \"To get practice in being refused.\"\nOnce, upon seeing the son of a prostitute throwing stones at a crowd, Diogenes approached him and whispered, \"Take care, boy, that you do not hit your father.\"\nWhen asked what was the right time to marry, Diogenes replied, \"For a young man, not yet; for an old man, never at all.\"\nHe was once observed eating in the marketplace (which was considered vulgar). When people gathered around calling him a dog, he replied, \"It is you who are dogs, who stand around and watch me eat.\"\nSomeone asked him what he had gained from philosophy. \"If nothing else,\" he replied, \"at least I am prepared for every fortune.\"\nWhen he was captured by pirates and put up for sale as a slave, the auctioneer asked him what he was good at. Diogenes replied, \"Ruling men.\" He then pointed to a wealthy Corinthian named Xeniades and said, \"Sell me to that man; he needs a master.\"", "source": "anecdotes.txt"}
