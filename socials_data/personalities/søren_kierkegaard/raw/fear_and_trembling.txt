Preface

Not only in the world of commerce but also in the world of ideas our age is putting on a veritable clearance sale. Everything can be had so dirt cheap that one begins to wonder whether in the end anyone will want to make a bid.

The Story of Abraham

There was once a man who as a child had heard the beautiful story about how God tempted Abraham, and how he endured the temptation, kept the faith, and a second time received a son against every expectation. When the child became older, he read the same story with even greater admiration, for life had separated what was united in the pious simplicity of the child. The older he became, the more frequently his thoughts turned to that story, his enthusiasm became greater and greater, and yet he was less and less able to understand the story. At last he forgot everything else in order to think about it; his soul had but one wish, to see Abraham, one longing, to be a witness to that event. His desire was not to see the beautiful regions of the East, or the earthly glory of the Promised Land, or that godfearing couple whose old age God had blessed, or the venerable figure of the aged patriarch, or the vigorous youth of Isaac bestowed by God—it was of no concern to him if the same thing had taken place on a barren heath. His yearning was to accompany them on the three days’ journey when Abraham rode with sorrow before him and Isaac by his side. His wish was to be present in that hour when Abraham lifted up his eyes and saw Mount Moriah afar off, the moment he left the asses behind and went up the mountain alone with Isaac; for what his mind was intent upon was not the beautiful tapestry of imagination but the shudder of thought.

Problem I: Is there a Teleological Suspension of the Ethical?

The ethical as such is the universal, and as the universal it applies to everyone, which may be expressed from another point of view by saying that it applies every instant. It reposes immanently in itself, has nothing without itself which is its telos, but is itself telos for everything outside it, and when this has been incorporated by the ethical it can go no further. Conceived immediately as physical and psychical, the particular individual is the individual who has his telos in the universal, and his ethical task is to express himself constantly in it, to abolish his particularity in order to become the universal. As soon as the individual asserts himself in his particularity over against the universal, he sins, and only by recognizing this can he again reconcile himself with the universal.

Faith is precisely this paradox, that the single individual is higher than the universal. If this is not faith, then Abraham is lost, then faith has never existed in the world… because it has always existed. For if the ethical (i.e., the moral) is the highest thing, and if nothing incommensurable remains in man in any other way but as the evil (i.e., the particular which has to be expressed in the universal), then one needs no other categories than those which the Greek philosophers possessed or which can be deduced from them by logic. But the story of Abraham contains such a teleological suspension of the ethical.

Abraham is not a tragic hero. The tragic hero renounces himself to express the universal, the knight of faith renounces the universal in order to become the particular individual.
