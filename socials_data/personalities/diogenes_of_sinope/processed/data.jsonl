{"text": "Diogenes was a native of Sinope, son of Hicesius, a banker. Diocles relates that he went into exile because his father was entrusted with the money of the state and adulterated the coinage. But Eubulides in his book on Diogenes says that Diogenes himself did this and was forced to leave home along with his father. Moreover Diogenes himself actually confesses in his Pordalus that he adulterated the coinage.\nOn reaching Athens he fell in with Antisthenes. Being repulsed by him, because he never welcomed pupils, by sheer persistence Diogenes wore him out. Once when he stretched out his staff against him, the pupil offered his head with the words, \"Strike, for you will find no wood hard enough to keep me away from you, so long as I think you've something to say.\" From that time forward he was his pupil, and, exile as he was, set out upon a simple life.\nThrough watching a mouse running about, says Theophrastus in the Megarian dialogue, not looking for a place to lie down in, not afraid of the dark, not seeking any of the things which are considered to be dainties, he discovered the means of adapting himself to circumstances. He was the first, say some, to fold his cloak because he was obliged to sleep in it as well, and he carried a wallet to hold his victuals, and he used any place for any purpose, for breakfasting, sleeping, or conversing. And then he would say, pointing to the portico of Zeus and the Hall of Processions, that the Athenians had provided him with places to live in.\nHe did not lean upon a staff until he grew infirm; but afterwards he would carry it everywhere, not indeed in the city, but when walking along the road with it and with his wallet. He had written to some one to try and procure a cottage for him. When this man was a long time about it, he took for his abode the tub in the Metro\u00f6n, as he himself explains in his letters. And in summer he used to roll in it over hot sand, while in winter he used to embrace statues covered with snow, using every means of inuring himself to hardship.\nHe was great at pouring scorn on his contemporaries. The school of Euclides he called bilious, and Plato's lectures waste of time, the performances at the Dionysia great peep-shows for fools, and the demagogues the mob's lacqueys. He used also to say that when he saw physicians, philosophers and pilots at their work, he deemed man the most intelligent of all animals; but when again he saw interpreters of dreams and diviners and those who attended to them, or those who were puffed up with conceit of wealth, he thought no animal more silly. He would continually say that for the conduct of life we need right reason or a halter.\nObserving Plato one day at a costly banquet taking olives, \"How is it,\" he said, \"that you the philosopher who sailed to Sicily for the sake of these dishes, now when they are before you do not enjoy them?\" \"Nay, by the gods, Diogenes,\" replied Plato, \"there also for the most part I lived upon olives and such like. \"Why then,\" said Diogenes, \"did you need to go to Syracuse? Was it that Attica at that time did not grow olives?\"\nAnother time he was eating dried figs when he encountered Plato and offered him a share of them. When Plato took them and ate them, he said, \"I said you might share them, not that you might eat them all up.\"\nAnd one day when Plato had invited to his house friends coming from Dionysius, Diogenes trampled upon his carpets and said, \"I trample upon Plato's vainglory.\" Plato's reply was, \"How much pride you expose to view, Diogenes, by seeming not to be proud.\"\nDiogenes once asked him for wine, and after that also for some dried figs; and Plato sent him a whole jar full. Then the other said, \"If some one asks you how many two and two are, will you answer, Twenty? So, it seems, you neither give as you are asked nor answer as you are questioned.\" Thus he scoffed at him as one who talked without end.\nBeing asked where in Greece he said good men, he replied, \"Good men nowhere, but good boys at Lacedaemon.\"\nWhen one day he was gravely discoursing and nobody attended to him, he began whistling, and as people clustered about him, he reproached them with coming in all seriousness to hear nonsense, but slowly and contemptuously when the testimony was serious.\nHe would say that men strive in digging and kicking to outdo one another, but no one strives to become a good man and true. And he would wonder that the grammarians should investigate the ills of Odysseus, while they were ignorant of their own. Or that the musicians should tune the strings of the lyre, while leaving the dispositions of their own souls discordant; that the mathematicians should gaze at the sun and the moon, but overlook matters close at hand; that the orators should make a fuss about justice in their speeches, but never practise it; or that the avaricious should cry out against money, while inordinately fond of it.\nHe used also to condemn those who praised honest men for being superior to money, while themselves envying the very rich. He was moved to anger that men should sacrifice to the gods to ensure health and in the midst of the sacrifice should feast to the detriment of health. He was astonished that when slaves saw their masters were gluttons, they did not steal some of the viands.\nHe would praise those who were about to marry and refrained, those who intending to go on a voyage never set sail, those who thinking to engage in politics do no such thing, those also who purposing to rear a family do not do so, and those who make ready to live with potentates, yet never come near them after all.\nHe used to say, moreover, that we ought to stretch out our hands to our friends with the fingers open and not closed.\nMenippus in his Sale of Diogenes tells how, when he was captured and put up for sale, he was asked what he could do. He replied, \"Govern men.\" And he told the crier to give notice in case anybody wanted to purchase a master for himself. Having been forbidden to sit down, \"It makes no difference,\" said he, \"for in whatever position fishes lie, they still find purchasers.\"\nAnd he said he marvelled that before we buy a jar or dish we try whether it rings true, but if it is a man are content merely to look at him.\nTo Xeniades who purchased him he said, \"You must obey me, although I am a slave; for, if a physician or a steersman were in slavery, he would be obeyed.\"\nXeniades once asked him how he wished to be buried. To which he replied, \"On my face.\" \"Why?\" inquired the other. \"Because,\" said he, \"after a little time down will be converted into up.\" This because the Macedonians had now got the supremacy, that is, had risen high from a humble position.\nSome one took him into a magnificent house and warned him not to expectorate, whereupon having cleared his throat he discharged the phlegm into the man's face, being unable, he said, to find a meaner receptacle.\nOne day he shouted out for men, and when people collected, hit out at them with his stick, saying, \"It was men I called for, not scoundrels.\"\nAlexander is reported to have said, \"Had I not been Alexander, I should have liked to be Diogenes.\"\nThe word \"disabled\" (\u1f00\u03bd\u03b1\u03c0\u03ae\u03c1\u03bf\u03c5\u03c2), Diogenes held, ought to be applied not to the deaf or blind, but to those who have no wallet (\u03c0\u03ae\u03c1\u03b1).\nOne day he made his way with head half shaven into a party of young revellers, as Metrocles relates in his Anecdotes, and was roughly handled by them. Afterwards he entered on a tablet the names of those who had struck him and went about with the tablet hung round his neck, till he had covered them with ridicule and brought universal blame and discredit upon them.\nHe described himself as a hound of the sort which all men praise, but no one, he added, of his admirers dared to go out hunting along with him.\nWhen some one boasted that at the Pythian games he had vanquished men, Diogenes replied, \"Nay, I defeat men, you defeat slaves.\"\nTo those who said to him, \"You are an old man; take a rest,\" \"What?\" he replied, \"if I were running in the stadium, ought I to slacken my pace when approaching the goal? ought I not rather to put on speed?\"\nHaving been invited to a dinner, he declared that he wouldn't go; for, the last time he went, his host had not expressed a proper gratitude.\nHe would walk upon snow barefoot and do the other things mentioned above. Not only so; he even attempted to eat meat raw, but could not manage to digest it.\nHe once found Demosthenes the orator lunching at an inn, and, when he retired within, Diogenes said, \"All the more you will be inside the tavern.\" When some strangers expressed a wish to see Demosthenes, he stretched out his middle finger and said, \"There goes the demagogue of Athens.\"\nSome one dropped a loaf of bread and was ashamed to pick it up; whereupon, Diogenes, wishing to read him a lesson, tied a rope to the neck of a wine-jar and proceeded to drag it across the Ceramicus.\nHe used to say that he followed the example of the trainers of choruses; for they too set the note a little high, to ensure that the rest should hit the right note.\nMost people, he would say, are so nearly mad that a finger makes all the difference. For, if you go along with your middle finger stretched out, some one will think you mad, but, if it's the little finger, he will not think so.\nVery valuable things, said he, were bartered for things of no value, and vice versa. At all events a statue fetches three thousand drachmas, while a quart of barley-flour is sold for two copper coins.\nSome one wanted to study philosophy under him. Diogenes gave him a tunny to carry and told him to follow him. And when for shame the man threw it away and departed, some time after on meeting him he laughed and said, \"The friendship between you and me was broken by a tunny.\"\nOne day, observing a child drinking out of his hands, he cast away the cup from his wallet with the words, \"A child has beaten me in plainness of living.\" He also threw away his bowl when in like manner he saw a child who had broken his plate taking up his lentils with the hollow part of a morsel of bread.\nHe used also to reason thus: \"All things belong to the gods. The wise are friends of the gods, and friends hold things in common. Therefore all things belong to the wise.\"\nOne day he saw a woman kneeling before the gods in an ungraceful attitude, and wishing to free her of superstition, he came forward and said, \"Are you not afraid, my good woman, that a god may be standing behind you? \u2014 for all things are full of his presence \u2014 and you may be put to shame?\"\nHe dedicated to Asclepius a bruiser who, whenever people fell on their faces, used to run up to them and bruise them.\nWhen he was sunning himself in the Craneum, Alexander came and stood over him and said, \"Ask of me any boon you like.\" To which he replied, \"Stand out of my light.\"\nSome one had been reading aloud for a very long time, and when he was near the end of the roll pointed to a space with no writing on it. \"Cheer up, my men,\" cried Diogenes; \"there's land in sight.\"\nTo one who by argument had proved conclusively that he had horns, he said, touching his forehead, \"Well, I for my part don't see any.\"\nIn like manner, when somebody declared that there is no such thing as motion, he got up and walked about.\nWhen some one was discoursing on celestial phenomena, \"How many days,\" asked Diogenes, \"were you in coming from the sky?\"\nA eunuch of bad character had inscribed on his door the words, \"Let nothing evil enter.\" \"How then,\" he asked, \"is the master of the house to get in?\"\nWhen he had anointed his feet with unguent, he declared that from his head the unguent passed into the air, but from his feet into his nostrils.\nThe Athenians urged him to become initiated, and told him that in the other world those who have been initiated enjoy a special privilege. \"It would be ludicrous,\" quoth he, \"if Agesilaus and Epaminondas are to dwell in the mire, while certain folk of no account will live in the Isles of the Blest because they have been initiated.\"\nWhen mice crept on to the table he addressed them thus, \"See now even Diogenes keeps parasites.\"\nWhen Plato styled him a dog, \"Quite true,\" he said, \"for I come back again and again to those who have sold me.\"\nAs he was leaving the public baths, some one inquired if many men were bathing. He said, No. But to another who asked if there was a great crowd of bathers, he said, Yes.\nPlato had defined Man as an animal, biped and featherless, and was applauded. Diogenes plucked a fowl and brought it into the lecture-room with the words, \"Here is Plato's man.\" In consequence of which there was added to the definition, \"having broad nails.\"\nTo one who asked what was the proper time for lunch, he said, \"If a rich man, when you will; if a poor man, when you can.\"\nAt Megara he saw the sheep protected by leather jackets, while the children went bare. \"It's better,\" said he, \"to be a Megaran's ram than his son.\"\nTo one who had brandished a beam at him and then cried, \"Look out,\" he replied, \"What, are you intending to strike me again?\"\nHe used to call the demagogues the lackeys of the people and the crowns awarded to them the efflorescence of fame.\nHe lit a lamp in broad daylight and said, as he went about, \"I am looking for a man.\"\nOne day he got a thorough drenching where he stood, and, when the bystanders pitied him, Plato said, if they really pitied him, they should move away, alluding to his vanity.\nWhen some one hit him a blow with his fist, \"Heracles,\" said he, \"how came I to forget to put on a helmet when I walked out?\"\nFurther, when Meidias assaulted him and went on to say, \"There are 3000 drachmas to your credit,\" the next day he took a pair of boxing-gauntlets, gave him a thrashing and said, \"There are 3000 blows to your credit.\"\nWhen Lysias the druggist asked him if he believed in the gods, \"How can I help believing in them,\" said he, \"when I see a god-forsaken wretch like you?\"\nSeeing some one perform religious purification, he said, \"Unhappy man, don't you know that you can no more get rid of errors of conduct by sprinklings than you can of mistakes in grammar?\"\nHe would rebuke men in general with regard to their prayers, declaring that they asked for those things which seemed to them to be good, not for such as are truly good.\nAs for those who were excited over their dreams he would say that they cared nothing for what they did in their waking hours, but kept their curiosity for the visions called up in their sleep.\nAt Olympia, when the herald proclaimed Dioxippus to be victor over the men, Diogenes protested, \"Nay, he is victorious over slaves, I over men.\"\nStill he was loved by the Athenians. At all events, when a youngster broke up his tub, they gave the boy a flogging and presented Diogenes with another.\nDionysius the Stoic says that after Chaeronea he was seized and dragged off to Philip, and being asked who he was, replied, \"A spy upon your insatiable greed.\" For this he was admired and set free.\nPerdiccas having threatened to put him to death unless he came to him, \"That's nothing wonderful,\" quoth he, \"for a beetle or a tarantula would do the same.\"\nHe would often insist loudly that the gods had given to men the means of living easily, but this had been put out of sight, because we require honeyed cakes, unguents and the like.\nHence to a man whose shoes were being put on by his servant, he said, \"You have not attained to full felicity, unless he wipes your nose as well; and that will come, when you have lost the use of your hands.\"\nOnce he saw the officials of a temple leading away some one who had stolen a bowl belonging to the treasurers, and said, \"The great thieves are leading away the little thief.\"\nNoticing a lad one day throwing stones at a cross (gibbet), \"Well done,\" he said, \"you will hit your mark.\"\nWhen some boys clustered round him and said, \"Take care he doesn't bite us,\" he answered, \"Never fear, boys, a dog does not eat beetroot.\"\nTo one who was proud of wearing a lion's skin his words were, \"Leave off dishonouring the habiliments of courage.\"\nWhen some one was extolling the good fortune of Callisthenes and saying what splendour he shared in the suite of Alexander, \"Not so,\" said Diogenes, \"but rather ill fortune; for he breakfasts and dines when Alexander thinks fit.\"\nBeing short of money, he told his friends that he applied to them not for alms, but for repayment of his due.\nSeeing a youth starting off to dine with satraps, he dragged him off, took him to his friends and bade them keep strict watch over him.\nWhen a youth effeminately attired put a question to him, he declined to answer unless he pulled up his robe and showed whether he was man or woman.\nA youth was playing cottabos in the baths. Diogenes said to him, \"The better you play, the worse it is for you.\"\nAt all times a feast certain people kept throwing all the bones to him as they would have done to a dog. Thereupon he played a dog's trick and drenched them.\nRhetoricians and all who talked for reputation he used to call \"thrice human,\" meaning thereby \"thrice wretched.\"\nAn ignorant rich man he used to call \"the sheep with the golden fleece.\"\nSeeing a notice on the house of a profligate, \"To be sold,\" he said, \"I knew well that after such surfeiting you would throw up the owner.\"\nTo a young man who complained of the number of people who annoyed him by their attentions he said, \"Cease to hang out a sign of invitation.\"\nOf a public bath which was dirty he said, \"When people have bathed here, where are they to go to get clean?\"\nThere was a stout musician whom everybody depreciated and Diogenes alone praised. When asked why, he said, \"Because being so big, he yet sings to his lute and does not turn brigand.\"\nThe musician who was always deserted by his audience he greeted with a \"Hail chanticleer,\" and when asked why he so addressed him, replied, \"Because your song makes every one get up.\"\nA young man was delivering a set speech, when Diogenes, having filled the front fold of his dress with lupins, began to eat them, standing right opposite to him. Having thus drawn off the attention of the assemblage, he said he was greatly surprised that they should desert the orator to look at himself.\nA very superstitious person addressed him thus, \"With one blow I will break your head.\" \"And I,\" said Diogenes, \"by a sneeze from the left will make you tremble.\"\nHegesias having asked him to lend him one of his writings, he said, \"You are a simpleton, Hegesias; you do not choose painted figs, but real ones; and yet you pass over the true training and would apply yourself to written rules.\"\nWhen some one reproached him with his exile, his reply was, \"Nay, it was through that, you miserable fellow, that I came to be a philosopher.\"\nAgain, when some one reminded him that the people of Sinope had sentenced him to exile, \"And I them,\" said he, \"to home-staying.\"\nOnce he saw an Olympic victor tending sheep and thus accosted him: \"Too quickly, my good friend, have you left Olympia for Nemea.\"\nBeing asked why athletes are so stupid, his answer was, \"Because they are built up of pork and beef.\"\nHe once begged alms of a statue, and, when asked why he did so, replied, \"To get practice in being refused.\"\nIn asking alms \u2014 as he did at first by reason of his poverty \u2014 he used this form: \"If you have already given to anyone else, give to me also; if not, begin with me.\"\nOn being asked by a tyrant what bronze is best for a statue, he replied, \"That of which Harmodius and Aristogiton were moulded.\"\nAsked how Dionysius treated his friends, \"Like purses,\" he replied; \"so long as they are full, he hangs them up, and, when they are empty, he throws them away.\"\nSome one lately wed had set up on his door this notice: \"The son of Zeus, victorious Heracles, Dwells here; let nothing evil enter in.\" To which Diogenes added \"After war, alliance.\"\nThe love of money he declared to be the mother-city of all evils.\nSeeing a spendthrift eating olives in a tavern, he said, \"If you had breakfasted in this fashion, you would not so be dining.\"\nGood men he called images of the gods, and love the business of the idle.\nTo the question what is wretched in life he replied, \"An old man destitute.\"\nBeing asked what creature's bite is the worst, he said, \"Of those that are wild a sycophant's; of those that are tame a flatterer's.\"\nUpon seeing two centaurs very badly painted, he asked, \"Which of these is Chiron?\" (worse man).\nIngratiating speech he compared to honey used to choke you. The stomach he called livelihood's Charybdis.\nHearing a report that Didymon the flute-player had been caught in adultery, his comment was, \"His name alone is sufficient to hang him.\"\nTo the question why gold is pale, his reply was, \"Because it has so many thieves plotting against it.\"\nOn seeing a woman carried in a litter, he remarked that the cage was not in keeping with the quarry.\nOne day seeing a runaway slave sitting on the brink of a well, he said, \"Take care, my lad, you don't fall in.\"\nSeeing some women hanged from an olive-tree, he said, \"Would that every tree bore similar fruit.\"\nOn seeing a footpad he accosted him thus: \"What mak'st thou here, my gallant? Com'st thou perchance for plunder of the dead?\"\nBeing asked whether he had any maid or boy to wait on him, he said \"No.\" \"If you should die, then, who will carry you out to burial?\" \"Whoever wants the house,\" he replied.\nNoticing a good-looking youth lying in an exposed position, he nudged him and cried, \"Up, man, up, lest some foe thrust a dart into thy back!\"\nTo one who was feasting lavishly he said: \"Short-lived thou'lt be, my son, by what thou \u2014 buy'st.\"\nAs Plato was conversing about Ideas and using the nouns \"tablehood\" and \"cuphood,\" he said, \"Table and cup I see; but your tablehood and cuphood, Plato, I can nowise see.\" \"That's readily accounted for,\" said Plato, \"for you have the eyes to see the visible table and cup; but not the understanding by which ideal tablehood and cuphood are discerned.\"\nOn being asked by somebody, \"What sort of a man do you consider Diogenes to be?\" \"A Socrates gone mad,\" said he.\nBeing asked what was the right time to marry, Diogenes replied, \"For a young man not yet: for an old man never at all.\"\nBeing asked what he would take to be soundly cuffed, he replied, \"A helmet.\"\nSeeing a youth dressing with elaborate care, he said, \"If it's for men, you're a fool: if for women, a knave.\"\nOne day he detected a youth blushing. \"Courage,\" quoth he, \"that is the hue of virtue.\"\nOne day after listening to a couple of lawyers disputing, he condemned them both, saying that the one had no doubt stolen, but the other had not lost anything.\nTo the question what wine he found pleasant to drink, he replied, \"That for which other people pay.\"\nWhen he was told that many people laughed at him, he made answer, \"But I am not laughed down.\"\nWhen some one declared that life is an evil, he corrected him: \"Not life itself, but living ill.\"\nWhen he was advised to go in pursuit of his runaway slave, he replied, \"It would be absurd, if Manes can live without Diogenes, but Diogenes cannot get on without Manes.\"\nWhen breakfasting on olives amongst which a cake had been inserted, he flung it away and addressed it thus: \"Stranger, betake thee from the princes' path.\"\nBeing asked what kind of hound he was, he replied, \"When hungry, a Maltese; when full, a Molossian \u2014 two breeds which most people praise, though for fear of fatigue they do not venture out hunting with them. So neither can you live with me, because you are afraid of the discomforts.\"\nBeing asked if the wise eat cakes, \"Yes,\" he said, \"cakes of all kinds, just like other men.\"\nBeing asked why people give to beggars but not to philosophers, he said, \"Because they think they may one day be lame or blind, but never expect that they will turn to philosophy.\"\nHe was begging of a miserly man who was slow to respond; so he said, \"My friend, it's for food that I am asking, not for funeral expenses.\"\nBeing reproached one day for having falsified the currency, he said, \"That was the time when I was such as you are now; but such as I am now, you will never be.\"\nOn coming to Myndus and finding the gates large, though the city itself was very small, he cried, \"Men of Myndus, bar your gates, lest the city should run away.\"\nSeeing a man who had been caught stealing purple, he said: \"Fast gripped by purple death and forceful fate.\"\nWhen Craterus wanted him to come and visit him, \"No,\" he replied, \"I would rather live on a few grains of salt at Athens than enjoy sumptuous fare at Craterus's table.\"\nHe went up to Anaximenes the rhetorician, who was fat, and said, \"Let us beggars have something of your paunch; it will be a relief to you, and we shall get advantage.\"\nAnd when the same man was discoursing, Diogenes distracted his audience by producing some salt fish.
