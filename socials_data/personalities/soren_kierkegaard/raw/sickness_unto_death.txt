The self is a relation that relates itself to itself or is the relation's relating itself to itself in the relation; the self is not the relation but is the relation's relating itself to itself.

Despair is the sickness unto death. It is the disrelationship in a relation which relates itself to itself. To be in despair is not just to be unhappy, it is to be misrelated to oneself, and ultimately, to God.

There are forms of despair: the despair of not wanting to be oneself, the despair of wanting to be oneself, and the despair of not knowing oneself. The commonest form of despair is not being oneself.

Sin is ignorance? No, sin is defiance. It is the intensification of despair. It is to be in despair before God.
