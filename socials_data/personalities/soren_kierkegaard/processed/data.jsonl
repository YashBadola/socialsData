{"text": "The Unhappiest One\nOf all the unhappy men, who is the unhappiest?\nIt is the one who cannot die.\nListen to the cry of a woman in labor at the hour of birth\u2014look at the dying man\u2019s struggle at his last extremity, and then tell me whether something that begins and ends thus could be intended for enjoyment.\nWhat is a poet? An unhappy man who in his heart harbors a deep anguish, but whose lips are so fashioned that the moans and cries which pass over them are transformed into ravishing music.\nI see it all perfectly; there are two possible situations \u2014 one can either do this or that. My honest opinion and my friendly advice is this: do it or do not do it \u2014 you will regret both.\nMarry, and you will regret it; don\u2019t marry, you will also regret it; marry or don\u2019t marry, you will regret it either way. Laugh at the world\u2019s foolishness, you will regret it; weep over it, you will regret that too; laugh at the world\u2019s foolishness or weep over it, you will regret both. Believe a woman, you will regret it; believe her not, you will also regret it\u2026 Hang yourself, you will regret it; do not hang yourself, and you will regret that too; hang yourself or don\u2019t hang yourself, you\u2019ll regret it either way; whether you hang yourself or do not hang yourself, you will regret both. This, gentlemen, is the essence of all philosophy.\nMy sorrow is my castle.", "source": "either_or_excerpt.txt"}
{"text": "Preface\nNot only in the world of commerce but also in the world of ideas our age is putting on a veritable clearance sale. Everything can be had so dirt cheap that one begins to wonder whether in the end anyone will want to make a bid. Every speculative price-setter who conscientiously signals the significant evolutionary trends in the credit market of ideas, every speculative price-setter, in short, who goes down to the Exchange, writes: Every, even the most insignificant student of theology is now capable of explaining the whole secret of existence, a task which has cost the most brilliant thinkers their lives.\nFaith is precisely this paradox, that the single individual is higher than the universal.\nIf there were no eternal consciousness in a man, if at the bottom of everything there were only a wild ferment, a power that twisting in dark passions produced everything great or inconsequential; if an unfathomable, insatiable emptiness lay hid beneath everything, what would life be but despair?\nFor he who loves God without faith reflects on himself, he who loves God believingly reflects on God.\nThe knight of faith gives up everything, and in finite sense gets everything back.\nTo have faith is to lose your mind and to win God.", "source": "fear_and_trembling_excerpt.txt"}
