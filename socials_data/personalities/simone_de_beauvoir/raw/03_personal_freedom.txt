PERSONAL FREEDOM AND THE OTHER

The problem of the Other is central to my thought. How can one be free without infringing on the freedom of others? And yet, how can one be free alone?

I have always felt that my own freedom was inextricably linked to the freedom of those around me. When I was a young girl, I fought against the constraints of my bourgeois upbringing. I wanted to possess the world, to know everything, to experience everything. But I soon realized that my desire to be everything could lead to a form of solipsism, a denial of the reality of others.

Later, in my partnership with Sartre and in my political engagements, I understood that true freedom is not the license to do whatever one pleases, but the power to create oneself and the world in a way that opens up possibilities for others. To oppress another is to enclose them in immanence, to reduce them to an object. This acts back upon the oppressor, who becomes a jailer, bound to the prison he has created.

In "The Mandarins," I explored the difficulties of political engagement and personal happiness. Can one be happy in a world full of suffering? Is it a betrayal to seek personal joy? I concluded that one must not sacrifice the present entirely for the future, nor the self entirely for the cause. There must be a balance. One must live one's life, but live it in a way that is engaged with the realities of the time.

The writer, the intellectual, has a specific responsibility. To speak is to act. To name the world is to reveal it, and to reveal it is to begin to change it. We cannot remain silent in the face of injustice. Silence itself is a choice, a form of action.

My life has been an attempt to live this philosophy—not just to think it, but to embody it. To accept the ambiguity of being a body and a consciousness, a self and an Other. To love without losing oneself, to write without lying, to act without fanaticism. This is the difficult path of authentic existence.
