{"text": "The Sickness Unto Death\nA Christian Psychological Exposition for Upbuilding and Awakening\nPreface\nTo many the form of this \"exposition\" will seem strange; it will seem to them too strict to be edifying, and too edifying to be strictly scientific. As to this latter objection I have no opinion. As to the former, however, I do not believe that it is correct. From the Christian point of view, everything, absolutely everything should serve for edification. The sort of learning which is not in the end edifying is precisely for that reason unchristian. Everything Christian is ipso facto edifying.\nPart First: The Sickness Unto Death is Despair\nI. That Despair is the Sickness Unto Death\nA. Despair is a Sickness in the Spirit, in the Self, and so it may have three forms: in Despair at not being conscious of having a Self (Despair improperly so called); in Despair at not willing to be oneself; in Despair at willing to be oneself.\nMan is spirit. But what is spirit? Spirit is the self. But what is the self? The self is a relation which relates itself to its own self, or it is that in the relation [which accounts for it] that the relation relates itself to its own self; the self is not the relation but [consists in the fact] that the relation relates itself to its own self. Man is a synthesis of the infinite and the finite, of the temporal and the eternal, of freedom and necessity, in short it is a synthesis. A synthesis is a relation between two factors. So regarded, man is not yet a self.\nIn the relation between two, the relation is the third term as a negative unity, and the two relate themselves to the relation, and in the relation to the relation; such a relation is that between soul and body, when man is regarded as soul. But if the relation relates itself to its own self, the relation is then the positive third term, and this is the self.\nSuch a relation which relates itself to its own self (that is to say, a self) must either have constituted itself or have been constituted by another. If this relation which relates itself to its own self is constituted by another, the relation doubtless is the third term, but this relation (the third term) is in turn a relation relating itself to that which constituted the whole relation. Such a derived, constituted, relation is the human self, a relation which relates itself to its own self, and in relating itself to its own self relates itself to another. Hence it is that there can be two forms of despair properly so called. If the human self had constituted itself, there could be a question only of one form: not to will to be one\u2019s own self, to will to get rid of oneself, but there could be no question of despair at willing to be oneself.\nThis form of despair (willing to be oneself) is the formula for all despair, so that the second form of despair (in despair at not willing to be oneself) can be followed back to the first (in despair at willing to be oneself), just as in the foregoing we resolved the first into the second (in despair at willing to be oneself into despair at not willing to be oneself). A despairing man wants despairingly to be himself. But if he despairingly wants to be himself, he will not want to get rid of himself. Yes, so it seems; but if one inspects more closely, one perceives that after all the contradiction is the same. That self which he despairingly wills to be is a self which he is not (for to will to be that self which one truly is, is indeed the opposite of despair); what he really wills is to tear his self away from the Power which constituted it. But notwithstanding all his despair, this he is unable to do, notwithstanding all the efforts of despair, that Power is the stronger, and it compels him to be the self he does not will to be. But for all that he wills to be rid of himself, to be rid of the self which he is, in order to be the self he himself has stumbled upon.\nB. The Possibility and the Actuality of Despair\nIs despair an advantage or a drawback? Regarded in a purely dialectical way it is both. If one were to stick to the abstract idea of a just man, one might say that it is an advantage. To be able to despair is an infinite advantage of the possibility; to be despairing is not only the greatest misfortune and misery\u2014no, it is perdition.\nThe formula that describes the state of the self when despair is completely rooted out is this: in relating itself to itself and in willing to be itself, the self rests transparently in the power that established it.", "source": "sickness_unto_death.txt"}
{"text": "Preface\nNot only in the world of commerce but also in the world of ideas our age is putting on a real clearance sale. Everything is to be had at such a bargain that it is questionable whether in the end there is anybody who will want to buy. Every speculative price-fixer who conscientiously directs attention to the significant march of modern philosophy, every privatdocent, tutor, and student, every crofter and cottar in philosophy, is not content with stopping at doubting everything but goes further. It might be premature and untimely to ask where they are going, but it is certainly polite and modest to assume that they have doubted everything, since otherwise it would be odd of them to say that they have proceeded further.\nProblem I: Is there a Teleological Suspension of the Ethical?\nThe ethical as such is the universal, and as the universal it applies to everyone, which may be expressed from another point of view by saying that it applies every instant. It rests immanent in itself, has nothing without itself which is its telos, but is itself telos for everything outside it, and when this has been incorporated by the ethical it can go no further. Conceived immediately as physical and psychical, the particular individual is the individual who has his telos in the universal, and his ethical task is to express himself constantly in it, to abolish his particularity in order to become the universal. As soon as the individual would assert himself as the particular over against the universal, he sins, and only by recognizing this can he again reconcile himself with the universal.\nFaith is precisely this paradox, that the individual as the particular is higher than the universal, is justified over against it, is not subordinate but superior\u2014yet in such a way, be it observed, that it is the particular individual who, after he has been subordinated as the particular to the universal, now through the universal becomes the individual who as the particular is superior to the universal, for the fact that the individual as the particular stands in an absolute relation to the absolute. This position cannot be mediated, for all mediation comes about precisely by virtue of the universal; it is and remains to all eternity a paradox, inaccessible to thought.\nIf this is not faith, then Abraham is lost, then faith has never existed in the world precisely because it has always existed. For if the ethical is the highest thing, and if nothing incommensurable remains in man in any other way but as the evil (i.e., the particular which has to be expressed in the universal), then one needs no other categories than those which the Greek philosophy possessed or which can be deduced from them by the most consistent thinking. But religion is then entirely abolished.\nThe Knight of Faith\nHe is no genius, for in vain I have striven to find in him the incommensurability of the genius. In the evening he walks home, his gait is as indefatigable as that of the postman. On his way he reflects that his wife has surely a special little warm dish prepared for him, e.g., a calf\u2019s head roasted, garnished with vegetables. If he were to meet a man who was likeminded, he could continue as far as East Gate to declaim with him the praise of that dish. And yet, and yet\u2014it is true, he is the only one who has ever done it\u2014it is true, he could not do it\u2014it is true, if I saw him, I should say, \"Good Lord, is this the man? Is it really he? Why, he looks like a tax-collector!\" But this man has made and every instant is making the movements of infinity. With infinite resignation he has drained the cup of life\u2019s profound sadness, he knows the bliss of the infinite, he senses the pain of renouncing everything, the dearest thing he has in the world, and yet finiteness tastes to him just as good as to one who never knew anything higher, for his continuance in the finiteness would have no trace of a fearful, anxious training, and yet he has this security of him who takes pleasure in it.\nInfinite resignation is the last stage prior to faith, so that one who has not made this movement has not faith; for only in the infinite resignation do I become clear to myself with respect to my eternal validity, and only then can there be question of grasping existence by virtue of faith.", "source": "fear_and_trembling.txt"}
{"text": "Diapsalmata\nWhat is a poet? An unhappy man who in his heart harbors a deep anguish, but whose lips are so fashioned that the moans and cries which pass over them are transformed into ravishing music. His fate is like that of the unfortunate victims whom the tyrant Phalaris imprisoned in a brazen bull, and slowly tortured over a steady fire; their cries could not reach the tyrant\u2019s ears so as to strike terror into his heart; when they reached him they sounded like sweet music. And men crowd about the poet and say to him, \"Sing for us soon again\"\u2014that is as much as to say, \"May new sufferings torment your soul, but may your lips be fashioned as before; for the cries would only distress us, but the music is delicious.\" And the critics come forward and say, \"That is perfectly done\u2014just as the rules of aesthetics demand.\" To be sure, a critic resembles a poet to a hair; he only lacks the anguish in his heart and the music upon his lips. I tell you, I would rather be a swineherd, understood by the swine, than a poet misunderstood by men.\nI do not care for anything. I do not care to ride, for the exercise is too violent. I do not care to walk, it is too strenuous. I do not care to lie down, for I should either have to remain lying, and I do not care to do that, or I should have to get up again, and I do not care to do that either. Summa summarum: I do not care at all.\nThere is nothing with which every man is so afraid as getting to know how enormously much he is capable of doing and becoming.\nThe most painful state of being is remembering the future, particularly the one you'll never have.\nI divide my time as follows: half the time I sleep, the other half I dream. I never dream when I sleep, for that would be a pity, for sleeping is the highest genius.\nMy sorrow is my castle, which like an eagle's nest is built high up on the mountain peaks among the clouds. No one can storm it. From it I fly down into reality and seize my prey; but I do not remain down there, I bring my booty home. And this booty is a picture I weave into the tapestries of my palace.\nLet others complain that the age is wicked; my complaint is that it is paltry; for it lacks passion. Men\u2019s thoughts are thin and flimsy like lace, they are themselves pitiable like the lacemakers. The thoughts of their hearts are too paltry to be sinful. For a worm it might be regarded as a sin to harbor such thoughts, but not for a man who is formed in the image of God. Their lusts are dull and sluggish, their passions sleepy. They do their duty, these shopkeeping souls, but they clip the coin a little...\nWhat if everything in the world were a misunderstanding, what if laughter were really tears?\nI have the courage, I believe, to doubt everything; I have the courage, I believe, to fight with everything; but I have not the courage to know anything, not the courage to possess, to own anything. Most people complain that the world is so prosaic, that life is not like a romance, where opportunities are always so favorable. I complain that life is not like a romance, where one has hard-hearted parents and nixies and trolls to fight, and enchanted princesses to free. What are all such enemies taken together compared with the pale, bloodless, tenacious, nocturnal shapes with which I fight and to which I myself give life and being?", "source": "either_or_diapsalmata.txt"}
