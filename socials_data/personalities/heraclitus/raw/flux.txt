You cannot step twice into the same rivers; for fresh waters are ever flowing in upon you.

We step and do not step into the same rivers; we are and are not.

It is the opposite which is good for us.

Couples are things whole and things not whole, what is drawn together and what is drawn asunder, the harmonious and the discordant. The one is made up of all things, and all things issue from the one.

Men do not know how what is at variance agrees with itself. It is an attunement of opposite tensions, like that of the bow and the lyre.

The hidden attunement is better than the open.

The straight and the crooked path of the fuller's comb is one and the same.

The way up and the way down is one and the same.

God is day and night, winter and summer, war and peace, surfeit and hunger; but he takes various shapes, just as fire, when it is mingled with spices, is named according to the savour of each.

War is the father of all and the king of all; and some he has made gods and some men, some bond and some free.

We must know that war is common to all and strife is justice, and that all things come into being and pass away through strife.

It rests by changing.
