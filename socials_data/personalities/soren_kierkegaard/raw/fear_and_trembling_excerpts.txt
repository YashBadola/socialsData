PRELUDE

Once upon a time there was a man who as a child had heard the beautiful story about how God tempted Abraham, and how he endured the temptation, kept the faith, and a second time received again a son contrary to expectation. When the man became older he read the same story with even greater admiration, for life had separated what was united in the pious simplicity of the child. The older he became, the more frequently his mind reverted to that story, his enthusiasm became greater and greater, and yet he was less and less able to understand the story. At last in his interest for that he forgot everything else; his soul had only one wish, to see Abraham, one longing, to have been witness to that event. His desire was not to behold the beautiful landscape of the East, or the earthly glory of the Promised Land, or that godfearing couple whose old age God had blessed, or the venerable figure of the aged patriarch, or the vigorous youth of Isaac bestowed by God—it was no matter of concern to him to see the triumphal procession of faith. It was not that which he wished to see. He wished only to accompany them on the three days’ journey when Abraham rode with sorrow.

I.
And God tempted Abraham and said unto him, Take Isaac, thine only son, whom thou lovest, and get thee into the land of Moriah, and offer him there for a burnt offering upon the mountain which I will show thee.

It was early in the morning, Abraham arose, saddled his ass, took with him two young men and Isaac his son, and clave the wood for the burnt offering.

Silently they rode for three days; but on the fourth morning Abraham said not a word but lifted up his eyes and saw Mount Moriah in the distance. He left the young men behind and went on alone with Isaac, led him by the hand. But when Abraham was alone he fell down upon his face and prayed. So they went to the place God had appointed.

Then Abraham lifted up the boy, he walked with him by his side, and his talk was full of comfort and exhortation. But Isaac could not understand him. He climbed Mount Moriah, but Abraham prepared everything for the sacrifice, calmly and quietly; but as he turned away and drew the knife, Isaac saw that his left hand was clenched in despair, that a tremor passed through his body—but Abraham drew the knife.

Then they returned again home, and Sarah hastened to meet them, but Isaac had lost his faith. No word of this had ever been spoken in the world, and Isaac never talked to anyone about what he had seen, and Abraham did not suspect that anyone had seen it.

II.
It was early in the morning, Abraham arose and kissed Sarah, the mother of his old age, and Sarah kissed Isaac, her delight, her joy for all time. And Abraham rode pensively along the way, he thought of Hagar and of the son whom he drove out into the wilderness, he climbed Mount Moriah, he drew the knife.

It was a quiet evening when Abraham rode out, he rode to Mount Moriah, he said to himself: “I will not conceal from Isaac whither this course leads.” He stood still, he laid his hand upon Isaac’s head in benediction, and Isaac bowed to receive it. And Abraham’s face was fatherly, his look was mild, his speech was admonishing. “My son, God himself will provide a lamb for the burnt offering.”

PANEGYRIC UPON ABRAHAM

If there were no eternal consciousness in a man, if at the foundation of all there lay only a wildly seething power which writhing with obscure passions produced everything that is great and everything that is insignificant, if a bottomless void never satiated lay hidden beneath all—what then would life be but despair? If such were the case, if there were no sacred bond which united mankind, if one generation arose after another like the leafage in the forest, if the one generation replaced the other like the song of birds in the forest, if the human race passed through the world as the ship goes through the sea, like the wind through the desert, a thoughtless and fruitless activity, if an eternal oblivion were always lurking hungrily for its prey and there were no power strong enough to wrest it from its maw—how empty then and comfortless life would be!

But therefore it is not so, but as God created man and woman, so too He fashioned the hero and the poet or orator. The poet cannot do what the hero does, he can only admire him and love him and rejoice in him.
