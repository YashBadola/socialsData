{"text": "This is the origin of our anguish. It is not a question of thinking that I might fall into the precipice or that I might not. I am my own possibility of falling, and I am also my own possibility of not falling. The precipice is there, but it is not a threatening cause; it is a passive danger which I must avoid or into which I may fall. My reaction to it is not determined; I must decide it. And because I am free, I am not the foundation of my freedom. I am condemned to be free. This means that no limits to my freedom can be found except freedom itself or, if you prefer, that we are not free to cease being free. To the extent that the for-itself wishes to hide its own nothingness from itself and to incorporate the in-itself as its true mode of being, it is trying also to hide its freedom from itself. The ultimate meaning of determinism is to establish within us an unbroken continuity of existence in itself. The motive, conceived as a psychic fact, i.e., as a full and given reality, is articulated without any break with the decision and the act, both of which are equally psychic facts. The in-itself has got hold of the for-itself. The for-itself which has become the in-itself is saved. But this determinism, a reflective defense against anguish, is not given as a reflective intuition. It acts as a postulate.", "source": "being_and_nothingness.txt"}
{"text": "Man is nothing else but that which he makes of himself. That is the first principle of existentialism. It is also what is called subjectivity, the name of which we are charged with when we are accused of subjectivism. But what do we mean by this, if not that man has a greater dignity than a stone or table? For we mean that man first exists, that is, that man first of all is the being who hurls himself toward a future and who is conscious of imagining himself as being in the future; and that man is at the start a plan which is aware of itself, rather than a patch of moss, a piece of garbage, or a cauliflower; nothing exists prior to this plan; there is nothing in heaven; man will be what he will have planned to be. Not what he will want to be. Because by the word \"will\" we generally mean a conscious decision, which is subsequent to what we have already made of ourselves. I may want to join a party, to write a book, to get married; but in such a case what is usually called my will is probably a manifestation of a prior and more spontaneous decision. If, however, it is true that existence is prior to essence, man is responsible for what he is. Thus, the first effect of existentialism is that it puts every man in possession of himself as he is, and places the entire responsibility for his existence squarely upon his own shoulders. And, when we say that man is responsible for himself, we do not mean that he is responsible only for his own individuality, but that he is responsible for all men.", "source": "existentialism.txt"}
