Preface

Not only in the world of commerce but also in the world of ideas our age is putting on a veritable clearance sale. Everything can be had so dirt cheap that one begins to wonder whether in the end anyone will want to make a bid. Every speculative price-fixer who conscientiously directs attention to the significant march of modern philosophy, every Privatdocent, tutor, and student, every crofter and cottager in philosophy, is not content with doubting everything but goes further. Perhaps it would be untimely and ill-timed to ask them where they are going, but surely it is courteous and unobtrusive to take it for granted that they have doubted everything, since otherwise it would be queer for them to be going further. This preliminary movement they have therefore all of them made, and presumably with such ease that they do not think it necessary to waste a word about the how; for not even he who anxiously and with deep concern sought a little enlightenment in the matter of doubting everything found any, not even he learned the art of walking on his hands, but merely learned that the others were all doing it, or at least saying so. But “doubting everything” is no easy thing as the single individuals seem to think who say of themselves that they are going further, though precisely for this reason one may suspect that they have not even made a beginning.

Faith is precisely this paradox, that the single individual as the particular is higher than the universal, is justified before it, not as subordinate but superior—yet in such a way, be it observed, that it is the particular individual who, after he has been subordinated as the particular to the universal, now through the universal becomes the individual who as the particular is superior to the universal, for the fact that the individual as the particular stands in an absolute relation to the absolute. This position cannot be mediated, for all mediation comes about precisely by virtue of the universal; it is and remains to all eternity a paradox, inaccessible to thought. And yet faith is this paradox—or else (these are the logical deductions which I would beg the reader to have in mundo) there never has been a faith ...
