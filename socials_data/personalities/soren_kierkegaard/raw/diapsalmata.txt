I have just now come from a party where I was its life and soul; witticisms streamed from my lips, everyone laughed and admired me, but I went away — yes, the dash should be as long as the radius of the earth's orbit ——————————— and wanted to shoot myself.

What is a poet? An unhappy man who hides deep anguish in his heart, but whose lips are so formed that when the sigh and cry pass through them, it sounds like lovely music. And the fate of the poet is like that of the unfortunates who were slowly tortured by a gentle fire in Phalaris's bull; their cries could not reach the tyrant's ears to cause him dismay, to him they sounded like sweet music. And men crowd about the poet and say to him: "Sing for us soon again"; that is as much as to say: "May new sufferings torment your soul, but may your lips be formed as before; for the cries would only frighten us, but the music is delicious." And the critics come forward and say: "That is the way it should be; the rules of aesthetics have been obeyed." To be sure, a critic resembles a poet to a hair, only he has no anguish in his heart, no music upon his lips. So I tell you, I would rather be a swineherd in Amager and be understood by the swine than be a poet and be misunderstood by men.

Let it happen what may. Let the world break into bits, let the elements turn to chaos—I shall stand by my principles.
