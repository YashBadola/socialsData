7. There is also no way of explaining how a monad can be altered or
   changed in its inner being by any other created thing, since there is
   no possibility of transposition within it, nor can we conceive of any
   internal movement which can be produced, directed, increased or
   diminished within it, such as can take place in the case of compounds
   where a change can occur among the parts. The monads have no windows
   through which anything may come in or go out. The Attributes cannot
   detach themselves or go forth from the substances, as could sensible
   species of the Schoolmen. In the same way neither substance nor
   attribute can enter from without into a monad.
