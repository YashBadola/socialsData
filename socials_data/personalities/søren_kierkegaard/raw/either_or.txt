DIAPSALMATA

What is a poet? An unhappy man who in his heart harbors a deep anguish, but whose lips are so fashioned that the sighs and cries which pass over them are transformed into ravishing music. His fate is like that of the unfortunate victims whom the tyrant Phalaris imprisoned in a brazen bull, and slowly tortured over a steady fire; their cries could not reach the tyrant’s ears so as to strike terror into his heart; when they reached him they sounded like sweet music.

I have just now come from a party where I was its life and soul; witticisms streamed from my lips, everyone laughed and admired me, but I went away — yes, the dash should be as long as the radius of the earth’s orbit ——————————— and wanted to shoot myself.

I do not care for anything. I do not care to ride, for the exercise is too violent. I do not care to walk, it is too strenuous. I do not care to lie down, for I should either have to remain lying, and I do not care to do that, or I should have to get up again, and I do not care to do that either. Summa summarum: I do not care at all.

My life is like an eternal night... when the stars go out, and the moon does not shine, and the sun does not rise, and there is no one who can say: It is day.

The Rotation of Crops

People with experience maintain that proceeding from a basic principle is the supposed starting point for all consistent thinking. I have heard and read that this is so, but I have not yet had the opportunity to verify it. But if I were to assume a basic principle, I know of no other than this one: all men are bored.

Boredom is the root of all evil. It is very curious that boredom, which itself has such a calm and sedate nature, can have such a capacity to initiate motion. The effect that boredom has is absolutely magical, but this effect is one not of attraction but of repulsion.

The method I propose does not consist in sowing the field of one's mind with new and diverse crops, but in rotating the crops. You must learn to forget. The art of remembering and the art of forgetting: these are the two things a man must learn.

The Esthetic Validity of Marriage

But what, then, is love? Love is the unity of the immediate and the eternal. It is the immediate, for it is based on a natural urge; it is eternal, for it is based on a decision of the will.
