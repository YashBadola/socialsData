Either/Or
A Fragment of Life

Preface

It may perhaps have occurred to you, dear reader, to doubt somewhat the correctness of the familiar philosophical proposition that the outward is the inward, the inward the outward. You have perhaps kept a secret which you felt in all its joy or pain was too precious for you to be willing to initiate others into it. Your life has perhaps brought you into contact with people of whom you suspected that something of the sort was the case, without your being able, however, to wrest their secret from them by force or to take them by surprise. Perhaps neither of these cases applies to you and your life, and yet you are not a stranger to this doubt; it has merely flitted across your mind now and then like a passing shadow.

For my own part, I have always been somewhat skeptical about this philosophical proposition; and my skepticism has been confirmed by the little observations I have made in life. I have often been astonished to see how much that is inward can be concealed by the outward, how much that is outward can be a deception, so that the real inwardness is something quite different. I have seen men who long deceived the world, until at last the world saw through them; but I have also seen men who deceived the world in a different way, men who were better than they seemed, men who hid their inwardness under a mask of frivolity or indifference, because they were ashamed of their own feelings.

The papers which I here publish fell into my hands in a rather singular way. I have never been a collector of antiques, but fate has sometimes thrown strange things in my way. Seven years ago I saw in a second-hand shop in Copenhagen a secretary which I at once fell in love with. It was not a modern piece of furniture, neither was it an antique; it was what one might call a "secretary of the old school," massive, simple, and yet with a certain dignity. I bought it and had it sent home.

Every day I opened the secretary, and every day I found new pleasure in it. But one morning, as I was opening a drawer which I had often opened before, I noticed that there was a secret compartment behind it. My heart beat violently as I pressed the spring which I had discovered. The compartment flew open, and there lay a large bundle of papers.

I took them out and examined them. They were written in different hands, and the contents were as varied as the handwriting. Some were long essays, others were short aphorisms; some were written in a serious, almost melancholy tone, others were full of wit and irony. But what struck me most was the fact that they all seemed to revolve around one central theme: the choice between the aesthetic and the ethical life.

The papers were divided into two parts. The first part, which I have called "A," contained a number of aesthetic essays and aphorisms. The second part, which I have called "B," contained a series of letters addressed to A, in which the writer, who calls himself "Judge William," argues for the ethical life.

I have spent the last seven years editing these papers, and I now present them to the public under the title "Either/Or." I have chosen this title because it seems to me to express the central theme of the work: the choice that every individual must make between living for pleasure and living for duty, between the aesthetic and the ethical.

But what if there is a third choice? What if the choice is not just between the aesthetic and the ethical, but between the finite and the infinite, between the temporal and the eternal? What if the true choice is the choice of faith?

This is the question that haunts the pages of "Either/Or," even though it is never explicitly stated. It is the question that Kierkegaard would spend the rest of his life exploring.

Diapsalmata

What is a poet? An unhappy man who in his heart harbors a deep anguish, but whose lips are so fashioned that the sighs and cries which pass over them are transformed into ravishing music. His fate is like that of the unfortunate victims whom the tyrant Phalaris imprisoned in a brazen bull, and slowly tortured over a slow fire; their cries could not reach the tyrant’s ears so as to strike terror into his heart; when they reached his ears they sounded like sweet music.

And men crowd about the poet and say to him, “Sing for us soon again”—which is as much as to say, “May new sufferings torment your soul, but may your lips be fashioned as before; for the cries would only distress us, but the music is delicious.” And the critics come forward and say, “That is perfectly done—just as it should be, according to the rules of aesthetics.” Now it is understood that a critic resembles a poet to a hair; he only lacks the anguish in his heart and the music upon his lips. Lo, therefore I would rather be a swineherd, understood by the swine, than be a poet and be misunderstood by men.

I feel as if I were a piece in a game of chess, when my opponent says of it: That piece cannot be moved.

My life is like an eternal night; but in this night the stars shine with a brilliance that the day knows not of.

The most beautiful thing in the world is to see a person who is at one with himself; but this is also the rarest thing in the world.

To have faith is to lose one's mind in order to win God.
