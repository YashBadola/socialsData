{"text": "The Monad, of which we shall here speak, is nothing but a simple substance, which enters into compounds. By 'simple' is meant that without parts.\nAnd there must be simple substances, since there are compounds; for a compound is nothing but a collection or aggregatum of simple things.\nNow where there are no parts, there can be neither extension nor form nor divisibility. These Monads are the real atoms of nature and in a word, the elements of things.\nNo dissolution of these elements need be feared, and there is no conceivable way in which a simple substance can be destroyed by natural means.\nFor the same reason there is no conceivable way in which a simple substance can come into being by natural means, since it cannot be formed by the combination of parts (composition).\nThus it may be said that a Monad can only come into being or end all at once; that is to say, it can come into being only by creation and end only by annihilation, while that which is compound begins or ends by parts.\nThere is no way of explaining how a Monad can be altered in quality or internally changed by any other created thing; since it is impossible to change the place or to conceive in it any internal motion which could be produced, directed, increased or diminished therein, although all this is possible in the case of compounds, in which there are changes among the parts. The Monads have no windows, through which anything could come in or go out. Accidents cannot separate themselves from substances nor go about outside of them, as the 'sensible species' of the Scholastics used to do. Thus neither substance nor accident can come into a Monad from outside.\nYet the Monads must have some qualities, otherwise they would not even be existing things. And if simple substances did not differ from each other, there would be no way of perceiving any change in things, for what is in the compound can come only from the simple elements it contains.\nEach Monad must be different from every other. For in nature there are never two beings which are perfectly alike and in which it is not possible to find an internal difference, or at least a difference founded upon an intrinsic quality.\nI assume also as admitted that every created being, and consequently the created Monad, is subject to change, and further that this change is continuous in each.\nIt follows from what has just been said, that the natural changes of the Monads come from an internal principle, since an external cause can have no influence upon their inner being.\nBut, besides the principle of the change, there must be a particular series of changes, which constitutes, so to speak, the specific nature and variety of the simple substances.\nThis particular series of changes should involve a multiplicity in the unit or in that which is simple. For, as every natural change takes place gradually, something changes and something remains immutable; and consequently a simple substance must be affected and related in many ways, although it has no parts.\nThe passing condition, which involves and represents a multiplicity in the unit or in the simple substance, is nothing but what is called Perception, which is to be distinguished from Apperception or Consciousness, as will appear in the following. In this matter the Cartesian view is extremely defective, for it treats as non-existent those perceptions of which we are not consciously aware. This has also led them to believe that minds alone are Monads, and that there are no souls of animals nor other Entelechies.\nIf we wish to discover what constitutes the nature of a simple substance, or Monad, we must look for it in Perception and Appetition. For since the Monad is a simple substance, it cannot have parts, and consequently it cannot have any extension, figure, or divisibility. It is therefore impossible to find in it anything but perceptions and their changes.\nThe action of the internal principle which brings about the change or passage from one perception to another may be called Appetition; it is true that desire cannot always fully attain to the whole perception at which it aims, but it always obtains some of it and reaches new perceptions.", "source": "monadology_excerpts.txt"}
{"text": "I. Concerning the divine perfection and that God does everything in the most desirable way.\nThe most widely accepted and meaningful notion we have of God is expressed well enough in these words: that God is an absolutely perfect being; yet the consequences of these words are not sufficiently considered. And, to get farther into the matter, it is appropriate to remark that there are several entirely different perfections in nature, that God possesses all of them together, and that each of them belongs to him in the highest degree. We must also know what a perfection is. One thing is quite certain, that if forms or natures were not simple, they would not be perfections. For, as I have said, they involve no limits or bounds. It follows from this that power and knowledge are perfections, and, insofar as they belong to God, they do not have limits.\nWhence it follows that God, possessing supreme and infinite wisdom, acts in the most perfect manner, not only metaphysically, but also morally speaking; and that we can say that in virtue of this, he is the most perfect architect, or rather the most perfect monarch, and that he does everything in the best possible way.\nII. Against those who hold that there is absolutely no goodness in the works of God, or that the rules of goodness and beauty are arbitrary.\nTherefore, I am far removed from the opinion of those who maintain that there are no rules of goodness and perfection in the nature of things, or in the ideas which God has of them, and that the works of God are good only for the formal reason that God has made them. For, if that were the case, God, knowing that he is the author of things, would not have to regard them afterwards and find them good, as holy scripture witnesses.\nIII. Against those who believe that God could have done better.\nNeither am I able to approve of the opinion of some moderns who maintain boldly that that which God has made is not perfect in the highest degree, and that he could have done much better. For it seems to me that the consequences of this opinion are wholly contrary to the glory of God. Uti minus malum habet rationem boni, ita minus bonum habet rationem mali. And to act with less perfection than one could have is to act imperfectly. To show that an architect could have done better is to find fault with his work.\nIV. That the love of God demands our complete satisfaction and acquiescence with respect to what he has done.\nThe general knowledge of this great truth that God acts always in the most perfect and most desirable manner possible, is in my opinion the basis of the love which we owe to God in all things; for he who loves seeks his satisfaction in the felicity or perfection of the object loved and of his actions. Idem velle et idem nolle vera amicitia est. I believe that it is difficult to love God truly when one, having the power to change his disposition, is not disposed to wish for what God desires.\nV. What the rules of perfection of the divine conduct consist in, and that the simplicity of the ways is in balance with the richness of the effects.\nIt is sufficient therefore to have this confidence in God, that he does everything for the best and that nothing can hurt those who love him. But to know in particular the reasons which have moved him to choose this order of the universe, to permit sins, to dispense his saving grace in a certain manner, this passes the capacity of a finite mind, above all when it has not yet come into the enjoyment of the vision of God. However, it is possible to make some general remarks touching the conduct of providence in the government of things. One can say that he who acts perfectly is like an excellent Geometer who knows how to find the best construction for a problem; like a good architect who utilizes his location and the funds destined for the building in the most advantageous manner, leaving nothing which shocks or which does not display that beauty of which it is capable.", "source": "discourse_on_metaphysics_excerpts.txt"}
