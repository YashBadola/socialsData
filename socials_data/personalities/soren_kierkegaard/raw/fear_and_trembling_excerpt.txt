The Knight of Faith is the only happy man, the heir to the finite, while the Knight of Infinite Resignation is a stranger and an alien. To make the movement of infinite resignation needs no faith, for what I gain by resignation is my eternal consciousness, and this is a purely philosophical movement which I dare say I am able to make if it is required, and which I can train myself to make, for whenever any finiteness becomes too heavy for me, I make a movement on my own self, and then I am in the infinite. But to have faith is this: that I, having made the movement of infinite resignation, then make the movement of faith by virtue of the absurd, and so get everything back again.

Here is the paradox: that the single individual is higher than the universal. If this is not so, then Abraham is a murderer and faith is a temptation. But if it is so, then Abraham is a knight of faith. He does not act by virtue of the universal, but by virtue of the absurd. He suspends the ethical, not to sin, but to reach a higher telos: his relationship with the Absolute. This is the teleological suspension of the ethical.

I cannot understand Abraham, I can only admire him. He believed that he would receive Isaac back, in this life, despite the fact that he was about to sacrifice him. This is the movement of faith, the double movement. Infinite resignation gives up everything, but faith says: "I shall imply get it all back by virtue of the absurd." This requires a passion that goes beyond human understanding.
