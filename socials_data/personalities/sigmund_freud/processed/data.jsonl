McCANN COMPANY\n1920\nTHE JAMES A. McCANN COMPANY\nPRINTED IN THE U.S.A.\nINTRODUCTION\nThe medical profession is justly conservative. Human life should not be\nconsidered as the proper material for wild experiments.\nConservatism, however, is too often a welcome excuse for lazy minds,\nloath to adapt themselves to fast changing conditions.\nRemember the scornful reception which first was accorded to Freud's\ndiscoveries in the domain of the unconscious.\nWhen after years of patient observations, he finally decided to appear\nbefore medical bodies to tell them modestly of some facts which always\nrecurred in his dream and his patients' dreams, he was first laughed at\nand then avoided as a crank.\nThe words \"dream interpretation\" were and still are indeed fraught with\nunpleasant, unscientific associations. They remind one of all sorts of\nchildish, superstitious notions, which make up the thread and woof of\ndream books, read by none but the ignorant and the primitive.\nThe wealth of detail, the infinite care never to let anything pass\nunexplained, with which he presented to the public the result of his\ninvestigations, are impressing more and more serious-minded scientists,\nbut the examination of his evidential data demands arduous work and\npresupposes an absolutely open mind.\nThis is why we still encounter men, totally unfamiliar with Freud's\nwritings, men who were not even interested enough in the subject to\nattempt an interpretation of their dreams or their patients' dreams,\nderiding Freud's theories and combatting them with the help of\nstatements which he never made.\nSome of them, like Professor Boris Sidis, reach at times conclusions\nwhich are strangely similar to Freud's, but in their ignorance of\npsychoanalytic literature, they fail to credit Freud for observations\nantedating theirs.\nBesides those who sneer at dream study, because they have never looked\ninto the subject, there are those who do not dare to face the facts\nrevealed by dream study. Dreams tell us many an unpleasant biological\ntruth about ourselves and only very free minds can thrive on such a\ndiet. Self-deception is a plant which withers fast in the pellucid\natmosphere of dream investigation.\nThe weakling and the neurotic attached to his neurosis are not anxious\nto turn such a powerful searchlight upon the dark corners of their\npsychology.\nFreud's theories are anything but theoretical.\nHe was moved by the fact that there always seemed to be a close\nconnection between his patients' dreams and their mental abnormalities,\nto collect thousands of dreams and to compare them with the case\nhistories in his possession.\nHe did not start out with a preconceived bias, hoping to find evidence\nwhich might support his views. He looked at facts a thousand times\n\"until they began to tell him something.\"\nHis attitude toward dream study was, in other words, that of a\nstatistician who does not know, and has no means of foreseeing, what\nconclusions will be forced on him by the information he is gathering,\nbut who is fully prepared to accept those unavoidable conclusions.\nThis was indeed a novel way in psychology. Psychologists had always been\nwont to build, in what Bleuler calls \"autistic ways,\" that is through\nmethods in no wise supported by evidence, some attractive hypothesis,\nwhich sprung from their brain, like Minerva from Jove's brain, fully\narmed.\nAfter which, they would stretch upon that unyielding frame the hide of a\nreality which they had previously killed.\nIt is only to minds suffering from the same distortions, to minds also\nautistically inclined, that those empty, artificial structures appear\nacceptable molds for philosophic thinking.\nThe pragmatic view that \"truth is what works\" had not been as yet\nexpressed when Freud published his revolutionary views on the psychology\nof dreams.\nFive facts of first magnitude were made obvious to the world by his\ninterpretation of dreams.\nFirst of all, Freud pointed out a constant connection between some part\nof every dream and some detail of the dreamer's life during the previous\nwaking state. This positively establishes a relation between sleeping\nstates and waking states and disposes of the widely prevalent view that\ndreams are purely nonsensical phenomena coming from nowhere and leading\nnowhere.\nSecondly, Freud, after studying the dreamer's life and modes of thought,\nafter noting down all his mannerisms and the apparently insignificant\ndetails of his conduct which reveal his secret thoughts, came to the\nconclusion that there was in every dream the attempted or successful\ngratification of some wish, conscious or unconscious.\nThirdly, he proved that many of our dream visions are symbolical, which\ncauses us to consider them as absurd and unintelligible; the\nuniversality of those symbols, however, makes them very transparent to\nthe trained observer.\nFourthly, Freud showed that sexual desires play an enormous part in our\nunconscious, a part which puritanical hypocrisy has always tried to\nminimize, if not to ignore entirely.\nFinally, Freud established a direct connection between dreams and\ninsanity, between the symbolic visions of our sleep and the symbolic\nactions of the mentally deranged.\nThere were, of course, many other observations which Freud made while\ndissecting the dreams of his patients, but not all of them present as\nmuch interest as the foregoing nor were they as revolutionary or likely\nto wield as much influence on modern psychiatry.\nOther explorers have struck the path blazed by Freud and leading into\nman's unconscious. Jung of Zurich, Adler of Vienna and Kempf of\nWashington, D.C., have made to the study of the unconscious,\ncontributions which have brought that study into fields which Freud\nhimself never dreamt of invading.\nOne fact which cannot be too emphatically stated, however, is that but\nfor Freud's wishfulfillment theory of dreams, neither Jung's \"energic\ntheory,\" nor Adler's theory of \"organ inferiority and compensation,\"\nnor Kempf's \"dynamic mechanism\" might have been formulated.\nFreud is the father of modern abnormal psychology and he established the\npsychoanalytical point of view. No one who is not well grounded in\nFreudian lore can hope to achieve any work of value in the field of\npsychoanalysis.\nOn the other hand, let no one repeat the absurd assertion that Freudism\nis a sort of religion bounded with dogmas and requiring an act of faith.\nFreudism as such was merely a stage in the development of\npsychoanalysis, a stage out of which all but a few bigoted camp\nfollowers, totally lacking in originality, have evolved. Thousands of\nstones have been added to the structure erected by the Viennese\nphysician and many more will be added in the course of time.\nBut the new additions to that structure would collapse like a house of\ncards but for the original foundations which are as indestructible as\nHarvey's statement as to the circulation of the blood.\nRegardless of whatever additions or changes have been made to the\noriginal structure, the analytic point of view remains unchanged.\nThat point of view is not only revolutionising all the methods of\ndiagnosis and treatment of mental derangements, but compelling the\nintelligent, up-to-date physician to revise entirely his attitude to\nalmost every kind of disease.\nThe insane are no longer absurd and pitiable people, to be herded in\nasylums till nature either cures them or relieves them, through death,\nof their misery. The insane who have not been made so by actual injury\nto their brain or nervous system, are the victims of unconscious forces\nwhich cause them to do abnormally things which they might be helped to\ndo normally.\nInsight into one's psychology is replacing victoriously sedatives and\nrest cures.\nPhysicians dealing with \"purely\" physical cases have begun to take into\nserious consideration the \"mental\" factors which have predisposed a\npatient to certain ailments.\nFreud's views have also made a revision of all ethical and social values\nunavoidable and have thrown an unexpected flood of light upon literary\nand artistic accomplishment.\nBut the Freudian point of view, or more broadly speaking, the\npsychoanalytic point of view, shall ever remain a puzzle to those who,\nfrom laziness or indifference, refuse to survey with the great Viennese\nthe field over which he carefully groped his way. We shall never be\nconvinced until we repeat under his guidance all his laboratory\nexperiments.\nWe must follow him through the thickets of the unconscious, through the\nland which had never been charted because academic philosophers,\nfollowing the line of least effort, had decided _a priori_ that it could\nnot be charted.\nAncient geographers, when exhausting their store of information about\ndistant lands, yielded to an unscientific craving for romance and,\nwithout any evidence to support their day dreams, filled the blank\nspaces left on their maps by unexplored tracts with amusing inserts such\nas \"Here there are lions.\"\nThanks to Freud's interpretation of dreams the \"royal road\" into the\nunconscious is now open to all explorers. They shall not find lions,\nthey shall find man himself, and the record of all his life and of his\nstruggle with reality.\nAnd it is only after seeing man as his unconscious, revealed by his\ndreams, presents him to us that we shall understand him fully. For as\nFreud said to Putnam: \"We are what we are because we have been what we\nhave been.\"\nNot a few serious-minded students, however, have been discouraged from\nattempting a study of Freud's dream psychology.\nThe book in which he originally offered to the world his interpretation\nof dreams was as circumstantial as a legal record to be pondered over by\nscientists at their leisure, not to be assimilated in a few hours by\nthe average alert reader. In those days, Freud could not leave out any\ndetail likely to make his extremely novel thesis evidentially acceptable\nto those willing to sift data.\nFreud himself, however, realized the magnitude of the task which the\nreading of his _magnum opus_ imposed upon those who have not been\nprepared for it by long psychological and scientific training and he\nabstracted from that gigantic work the parts which constitute the\nessential of his discoveries.\nThe publishers of the present book deserve credit for presenting to the\nreading public the gist of Freud's psychology in the master's own words,\nand in a form which shall neither discourage beginners, nor appear too\nelementary to those who are more advanced in psychoanalytic study.\nDream psychology is the key to Freud's works and to all modern\npsychology. With a simple, compact manual such as _Dream Psychology_\nthere shall be no longer any excuse for ignorance of the most\nrevolutionary psychological system of modern times.\nANDR\u00c9 TRIDON.\n121 Madison Avenue, New York.\nNovember, 1920.\nCONTENTS\nCHAPTER                                                             PAGE\nI  DREAMS HAVE A MEANING                                            1\nII  THE DREAM MECHANISM                                             24\nIII  WHY THE DREAM DISGUISES THE DESIRES                             57\nIV  DREAM ANALYSIS                                                  78\nV  SEX IN DREAMS                                                  104\nVI  THE WISH IN DREAMS                                             135\nVII  THE FUNCTION OF THE DREAM                                      164\nVIII  THE PRIMARY AND SECONDARY PROCESS--REGRESSION                  186\nIX  THE UNCONSCIOUS AND CONSCIOUSNESS--REALITY                     220\nDREAM PSYCHOLOGY\nI\nDREAMS HAVE A MEANING\nIn what we may term \"prescientific days\" people were in no uncertainty\nabout the interpretation of dreams. When they were recalled after\nawakening they were regarded as either the friendly or hostile\nmanifestation of some higher powers, demoniacal and Divine. With the\nrise of scientific thought the whole of this expressive mythology was\ntransferred to psychology; to-day there is but a small minority among\neducated persons who doubt that the dream is the dreamer's own psychical\nact.\nBut since the downfall of the mythological hypothesis an interpretation\nof the dream has been wanting. The conditions of its origin; its\nrelationship to our psychical life when we are awake; its independence\nof disturbances which, during the state of sleep, seem to compel notice;\nits many peculiarities repugnant to our waking thought; the incongruence\nbetween its images and the feelings they engender; then the dream's\nevanescence, the way in which, on awakening, our thoughts thrust it\naside as something bizarre, and our reminiscences mutilating or\nrejecting it--all these and many other problems have for many hundred\nyears demanded answers which up till now could never have been\nsatisfactory. Before all there is the question as to the meaning of the\ndream, a question which is in itself double-sided. There is, firstly,\nthe psychical significance of the dream, its position with regard to the\npsychical processes, as to a possible biological function; secondly, has\nthe dream a meaning--can sense be made of each single dream as of other\nmental syntheses?\nThree tendencies can be observed in the estimation of dreams. Many\nphilosophers have given currency to one of these tendencies, one which\nat the same time preserves something of the dream's former\nover-valuation. The foundation of dream life is for them a peculiar\nstate of psychical activity, which they even celebrate as elevation to\nsome higher state. Schubert, for instance, claims: \"The dream is the\nliberation of the spirit from the pressure of external nature, a\ndetachment of the soul from the fetters of matter.\" Not all go so far as\nthis, but many maintain that dreams have their origin in real spiritual\nexcitations, and are the outward manifestations of spiritual powers\nwhose free movements have been hampered during the day (\"Dream\nPhantasies,\" Scherner, Volkelt). A large number of observers acknowledge\nthat dream life is capable of extraordinary achievements--at any rate,\nin certain fields (\"Memory\").\nIn striking contradiction with this the majority of medical writers\nhardly admit that the dream is a psychical phenomenon at all. According\nto them dreams are provoked and initiated exclusively by stimuli\nproceeding from the senses or the body, which either reach the sleeper\nfrom without or are accidental disturbances of his internal organs. The\ndream has no greater claim to meaning and importance than the sound\ncalled forth by the ten fingers of a person quite unacquainted with\nmusic running his fingers over the keys of an instrument. The dream is\nto be regarded, says Binz, \"as a physical process always useless,\nfrequently morbid.\" All the peculiarities of dream life are explicable\nas the incoherent effort, due to some physiological stimulus, of certain\norgans, or of the cortical elements of a brain otherwise asleep.\nBut slightly affected by scientific opinion and untroubled as to the\norigin of dreams, the popular view holds firmly to the belief that\ndreams really have got a meaning, in some way they do foretell the\nfuture, whilst the meaning can be unravelled in some way or other from\nits oft bizarre and enigmatical content. The reading of dreams consists\nin replacing the events of the dream, so far as remembered, by other\nevents. This is done either scene by scene, _according to some rigid\nkey_, or the dream as a whole is replaced by something else of which it\nwas a _symbol_. Serious-minded persons laugh at these efforts--\"Dreams\nare but sea-foam!\"\nOne day I discovered to my amazement that the popular view grounded in\nsuperstition, and not the medical one, comes nearer to the truth about\ndreams. I arrived at new conclusions about dreams by the use of a new\nmethod of psychological investigation, one which had rendered me good\nservice in the investigation of phobias, obsessions, illusions, and the\nlike, and which, under the name \"psycho-analysis,\" had found acceptance\nby a whole school of investigators. The manifold analogies of dream life\nwith the most diverse conditions of psychical disease in the waking\nstate have been rightly insisted upon by a number of medical observers.\nIt seemed, therefore, _a priori_, hopeful to apply to the interpretation\nof dreams methods of investigation which had been tested in\npsychopathological processes. Obsessions and those peculiar sensations\nof haunting dread remain as strange to normal consciousness as do\ndreams to our waking consciousness; their origin is as unknown to\nconsciousness as is that of dreams. It was practical ends that impelled\nus, in these diseases, to fathom their origin and formation. Experience\nhad shown us that a cure and a consequent mastery of the obsessing ideas\ndid result when once those thoughts, the connecting links between the\nmorbid ideas and the rest of the psychical content, were revealed which\nwere heretofore veiled from consciousness. The procedure I employed for\nthe interpretation of dreams thus arose from psychotherapy.\nThis procedure is readily described, although its practice demands\ninstruction and experience. Suppose the patient is suffering from\nintense morbid dread. He is requested to direct his attention to the\nidea in question, without, however, as he has so frequently done,\nmeditating upon it. Every impression about it, without any exception,\nwhich occurs to him should be imparted to the doctor. The statement\nwhich will be perhaps then made, that he cannot concentrate his\nattention upon anything at all, is to be countered by assuring him most\npositively that such a blank state of mind is utterly impossible. As a\nmatter of fact, a great number of impressions will soon occur, with\nwhich others will associate themselves. These will be invariably\naccompanied by the expression of the observer's opinion that they have\nno meaning or are unimportant. It will be at once noticed that it is\nthis self-criticism which prevented the patient from imparting the\nideas, which had indeed already excluded them from consciousness. If the\npatient can be induced to abandon this self-criticism and to pursue the\ntrains of thought which are yielded by concentrating the attention, most\nsignificant matter will be obtained, matter which will be presently seen\nto be clearly linked to the morbid idea in question. Its connection with\nother ideas will be manifest, and later on will permit the replacement\nof the morbid idea by a fresh one, which is perfectly adapted to\npsychical continuity.\nThis is not the place to examine thoroughly the hypothesis upon which\nthis experiment rests, or the deductions which follow from its\ninvariable success. It must suffice to state that we obtain matter\nenough for the resolution of every morbid idea if we especially direct\nour attention to the _unbidden_ associations _which disturb our\nthoughts_--those which are otherwise put aside by the critic as\nworthless refuse. If the procedure is exercised on oneself, the best\nplan of helping the experiment is to write down at once all one's first\nindistinct fancies.\nI will now point out where this method leads when I apply it to the\nexamination of dreams. Any dream could be made use of in this way. From\ncertain motives I, however, choose a dream of my own, which appears\nconfused and meaningless to my memory, and one which has the advantage\nof brevity. Probably my dream of last night satisfies the requirements.\nIts content, fixed immediately after awakening, runs as follows:\n_\"Company; at table or table d'h\u00f4te.... Spinach is served. Mrs. E.L.,\nsitting next to me, gives me her undivided attention, and places her\nhand familiarly upon my knee. In defence I remove her hand. Then she\nsays: 'But you have always had such beautiful eyes.'.... I then\ndistinctly see something like two eyes as a sketch or as the contour of\na spectacle lens....\"_\nThis is the whole dream, or, at all events, all that I can remember. It\nappears to me not only obscure and meaningless, but more especially odd.\nMrs. E.L. is a person with whom I am scarcely on visiting terms, nor to\nmy knowledge have I ever desired any more cordial relationship. I have\nnot seen her for a long time, and do not think there was any mention of\nher recently. No emotion whatever accompanied the dream process.\nReflecting upon this dream does not make it a bit clearer to my mind. I\nwill now, however, present the ideas, without premeditation and without\ncriticism, which introspection yielded. I soon notice that it is an\nadvantage to break up the dream into its elements, and to search out the\nideas which link themselves to each fragment.\n_Company; at table or table d'h\u00f4te._ The recollection of the slight\nevent with which the evening of yesterday ended is at once called up. I\nleft a small party in the company of a friend, who offered to drive me\nhome in his cab. \"I prefer a taxi,\" he said; \"that gives one such a\npleasant occupation; there is always something to look at.\" When we were\nin the cab, and the cab-driver turned the disc so that the first sixty\nhellers were visible, I continued the jest. \"We have hardly got in and\nwe already owe sixty hellers. The taxi always reminds me of the table\nd'h\u00f4te. It makes me avaricious and selfish by continuously reminding me\nof my debt. It seems to me to mount up too quickly, and I am always\nafraid that I shall be at a disadvantage, just as I cannot resist at\ntable d'h\u00f4te the comical fear that I am getting too little, that I must\nlook after myself.\" In far-fetched connection with this I quote:\n\"To earth, this weary earth, ye bring us,\nTo guilt ye let us heedless go.\"\nAnother idea about the table d'h\u00f4te. A few weeks ago I was very cross\nwith my dear wife at the dinner-table at a Tyrolese health resort,\nbecause she was not sufficiently reserved with some neighbors with whom\nI wished to have absolutely nothing to do. I begged her to occupy\nherself rather with me than with the strangers. That is just as if I had\n_been at a disadvantage at the table d'h\u00f4te_. The contrast between the\nbehavior of my wife at the table and that of Mrs. E.L. in the dream now\nstrikes me: _\"Addresses herself entirely to me.\"_\nFurther, I now notice that the dream is the reproduction of a little\nscene which transpired between my wife and myself when I was secretly\ncourting her. The caressing under cover of the tablecloth was an answer\nto a wooer's passionate letter. In the dream, however, my wife is\nreplaced by the unfamiliar E.L.\nMrs. E.L. is the daughter of a man to whom I _owed money_! I cannot help\nnoticing that here there is revealed an unsuspected connection between\nthe dream content and my thoughts. If the chain of associations be\nfollowed up which proceeds from one element of the dream one is soon led\nback to another of its elements. The thoughts evoked by the dream stir\nup associations which were not noticeable in the dream itself.\nIs it not customary, when some one expects others to look after his\ninterests without any advantage to themselves, to ask the innocent\nquestion satirically: \"Do you think this will be done _for the sake of\nyour beautiful eyes_?\" Hence Mrs. E.L.'s speech in the dream. \"You have\nalways had such beautiful eyes,\" means nothing but \"people always do\neverything to you for love of you; you have had _everything for\nnothing_.\" The contrary is, of course, the truth; I have always paid\ndearly for whatever kindness others have shown me. Still, the fact that\n_I had a ride for nothing_ yesterday when my friend drove me home in his\ncab must have made an impression upon me.\nIn any case, the friend whose guests we were yesterday has often made me\nhis debtor. Recently I allowed an opportunity of requiting him to go by.\nHe has had only one present from me, an antique shawl, upon which eyes\nare painted all round, a so-called Occhiale, as a _charm_ against the\n_Malocchio_. Moreover, he is an _eye specialist_. That same evening I\nhad asked him after a patient whom I had sent to him for _glasses_.\nAs I remarked, nearly all parts of the dream have been brought into this\nnew connection. I still might ask why in the dream it was _spinach_\nthat was served up. Because spinach called up a little scene which\nrecently occurred at our table. A child, whose _beautiful eyes_ are\nreally deserving of praise, refused to eat spinach. As a child I was\njust the same; for a long time I loathed _spinach_, until in later life\nmy tastes altered, and it became one of my favorite dishes. The mention\nof this dish brings my own childhood and that of my child's near\ntogether. \"You should be glad that you have some spinach,\" his mother\nhad said to the little gourmet. \"Some children would be very glad to get\nspinach.\" Thus I am reminded of the parents' duties towards their\nchildren. Goethe's words--\n\"To earth, this weary earth, ye bring us,\nTo guilt ye let us heedless go\"--\ntake on another meaning in this connection.\nHere I will stop in order that I may recapitulate the results of the\nanalysis of the dream. By following the associations which were linked\nto the single elements of the dream torn from their context, I have been\nled to a series of thoughts and reminiscences where I am bound to\nrecognize interesting expressions of my psychical life. The matter\nyielded by an analysis of the dream stands in intimate relationship with\nthe dream content, but this relationship is so special that I should\nnever have been able to have inferred the new discoveries directly from\nthe dream itself. The dream was passionless, disconnected, and\nunintelligible. During the time that I am unfolding the thoughts at the\nback of the dream I feel intense and well-grounded emotions. The\nthoughts themselves fit beautifully together into chains logically bound\ntogether with certain central ideas which ever repeat themselves. Such\nideas not represented in the dream itself are in this instance the\nantitheses _selfish, unselfish, to be indebted, to work for nothing_. I\ncould draw closer the threads of the web which analysis has disclosed,\nand would then be able to show how they all run together into a single\nknot; I am debarred from making this work public by considerations of a\nprivate, not of a scientific, nature. After having cleared up many\nthings which I do not willingly acknowledge as mine, I should have much\nto reveal which had better remain my secret. Why, then, do not I choose\nanother dream whose analysis would be more suitable for publication, so\nthat I could awaken a fairer conviction of the sense and cohesion of the\nresults disclosed by analysis? The answer is, because every dream which\nI investigate leads to the same difficulties and places me under the\nsame need of discretion; nor should I forgo this difficulty any the\nmore were I to analyze the dream of some one else. That could only be\ndone when opportunity allowed all concealment to be dropped without\ninjury to those who trusted me.\nThe conclusion which is now forced upon me is that the dream is a _sort\nof substitution_ for those emotional and intellectual trains of thought\nwhich I attained after complete analysis. I do not yet know the process\nby which the dream arose from those thoughts, but I perceive that it is\nwrong to regard the dream as psychically unimportant, a purely physical\nprocess which has arisen from the activity of isolated cortical elements\nawakened out of sleep.\nI must further remark that the dream is far shorter than the thoughts\nwhich I hold it replaces; whilst analysis discovered that the dream was\nprovoked by an unimportant occurrence the evening before the dream.\nNaturally, I would not draw such far-reaching conclusions if only one\nanalysis were known to me. Experience has shown me that when the\nassociations of any dream are honestly followed such a chain of thought\nis revealed, the constituent parts of the dream reappear correctly and\nsensibly linked together; the slight suspicion that this concatenation\nwas merely an accident of a single first observation must, therefore,\nbe absolutely relinquished. I regard it, therefore, as my right to\nestablish this new view by a proper nomenclature. I contrast the dream\nwhich my memory evokes with the dream and other added matter revealed by\nanalysis: the former I call the dream's _manifest content_; the latter,\nwithout at first further subdivision, its _latent content_. I arrive at\ntwo new problems hitherto unformulated: (1) What is the psychical\nprocess which has transformed the latent content of the dream into its\nmanifest content? (2) What is the motive or the motives which have made\nsuch transformation exigent? The process by which the change from latent\nto manifest content is executed I name the _dream-work_. In contrast\nwith this is the _work of analysis_, which produces the reverse\ntransformation. The other problems of the dream--the inquiry as to its\nstimuli, as to the source of its materials, as to its possible purpose,\nthe function of dreaming, the forgetting of dreams--these I will discuss\nin connection with the latent dream-content.\nI shall take every care to avoid a confusion between the _manifest_ and\nthe _latent content_, for I ascribe all the contradictory as well as the\nincorrect accounts of dream-life to the ignorance of this latent\ncontent, now first laid bare through analysis.\nThe conversion of the latent dream thoughts into those manifest deserves\nour close study as the first known example of the transformation of\npsychical stuff from one mode of expression into another. From a mode of\nexpression which, moreover, is readily intelligible into another which\nwe can only penetrate by effort and with guidance, although this new\nmode must be equally reckoned as an effort of our own psychical\nactivity. From the standpoint of the relationship of latent to manifest\ndream-content, dreams can be divided into three classes. We can, in the\nfirst place, distinguish those dreams which have a _meaning_ and are, at\nthe same time, _intelligible_, which allow us to penetrate into our\npsychical life without further ado. Such dreams are numerous; they are\nusually short, and, as a general rule, do not seem very noticeable,\nbecause everything remarkable or exciting surprise is absent. Their\noccurrence is, moreover, a strong argument against the doctrine which\nderives the dream from the isolated activity of certain cortical\nelements. All signs of a lowered or subdivided psychical activity are\nwanting. Yet we never raise any objection to characterizing them as\ndreams, nor do we confound them with the products of our waking life.\nA second group is formed by those dreams which are indeed self-coherent\nand have a distinct meaning, but appear strange because we are unable to\nreconcile their meaning with our mental life. That is the case when we\ndream, for instance, that some dear relative has died of plague when we\nknow of no ground for expecting, apprehending, or assuming anything of\nthe sort; we can only ask ourself wonderingly: \"What brought that into\nmy head?\" To the third group those dreams belong which are void of both\nmeaning and intelligibility; they are _incoherent, complicated, and\nmeaningless_. The overwhelming number of our dreams partake of this\ncharacter, and this has given rise to the contemptuous attitude towards\ndreams and the medical theory of their limited psychical activity. It is\nespecially in the longer and more complicated dream-plots that signs of\nincoherence are seldom missing.\nThe contrast between manifest and latent dream-content is clearly only\nof value for the dreams of the second and more especially for those of\nthe third class. Here are problems which are only solved when the\nmanifest dream is replaced by its latent content; it was an example of\nthis kind, a complicated and unintelligible dream, that we subjected to\nanalysis. Against our expectation we, however, struck upon reasons which\nprevented a complete cognizance of the latent dream thought. On the\nrepetition of this same experience we were forced to the supposition\nthat there is an _intimate bond, with laws of its own, between the\nunintelligible and complicated nature of the dream and the difficulties\nattending communication of the thoughts connected with the dream_.\nBefore investigating the nature of this bond, it will be advantageous to\nturn our attention to the more readily intelligible dreams of the first\nclass where, the manifest and latent content being identical, the dream\nwork seems to be omitted.\nThe investigation of these dreams is also advisable from another\nstandpoint. The dreams of _children_ are of this nature; they have a\nmeaning, and are not bizarre. This, by the way, is a further objection\nto reducing dreams to a dissociation of cerebral activity in sleep, for\nwhy should such a lowering of psychical functions belong to the nature\nof sleep in adults, but not in children? We are, however, fully\njustified in expecting that the explanation of psychical processes in\nchildren, essentially simplified as they may be, should serve as an\nindispensable preparation towards the psychology of the adult.\nI shall therefore cite some examples of dreams which I have gathered\nfrom children. A girl of nineteen months was made to go without food\nfor a day because she had been sick in the morning, and, according to\nnurse, had made herself ill through eating strawberries. During the\nnight, after her day of fasting, she was heard calling out her name\nduring sleep, and adding: \"_Tawberry, eggs, pap_.\" She is dreaming that\nshe is eating, and selects out of her menu exactly what she supposes she\nwill not get much of just now.\nThe same kind of dream about a forbidden dish was that of a little boy\nof twenty-two months. The day before he was told to offer his uncle a\npresent of a small basket of cherries, of which the child was, of\ncourse, only allowed one to taste. He woke up with the joyful news:\n\"Hermann eaten up all the cherries.\"\nA girl of three and a half years had made during the day a sea trip\nwhich was too short for her, and she cried when she had to get out of\nthe boat. The next morning her story was that during the night she had\nbeen on the sea, thus continuing the interrupted trip.\nA boy of five and a half years was not at all pleased with his party\nduring a walk in the Dachstein region. Whenever a new peak came into\nsight he asked if that were the Dachstein, and, finally, refused to\naccompany the party to the waterfall. His behavior was ascribed to\nfatigue; but a better explanation was forthcoming when the next morning\nhe told his dream: _he had ascended the Dachstein_. Obviously he\nexpected the ascent of the Dachstein to be the object of the excursion,\nand was vexed by not getting a glimpse of the mountain. The dream gave\nhim what the day had withheld. The dream of a girl of six was similar;\nher father had cut short the walk before reaching the promised objective\non account of the lateness of the hour. On the way back she noticed a\nsignpost giving the name of another place for excursions; her father\npromised to take her there also some other day. She greeted her father\nnext day with the news that she had dreamt that _her father had been\nwith her to both places_.\nWhat is common in all these dreams is obvious. They completely satisfy\nwishes excited during the day which remain unrealized. They are simply\nand undisguisedly realizations of wishes.\nThe following child-dream, not quite understandable at first sight, is\nnothing else than a wish realized. On account of poliomyelitis a girl,\nnot quite four years of age, was brought from the country into town, and\nremained over night with a childless aunt in a big--for her, naturally,\nhuge--bed. The next morning she stated that she had dreamt that _the\nbed was much too small for her, so that she could find no place in it_.\nTo explain this dream as a wish is easy when we remember that to be\n\"big\" is a frequently expressed wish of all children. The bigness of the\nbed reminded Miss Little-Would-be-Big only too forcibly of her\nsmallness. This nasty situation became righted in her dream, and she\ngrew so big that the bed now became too small for her.\nEven when children's dreams are complicated and polished, their\ncomprehension as a realization of desire is fairly evident. A boy of\neight dreamt that he was being driven with Achilles in a war-chariot,\nguided by Diomedes. The day before he was assiduously reading about\ngreat heroes. It is easy to show that he took these heroes as his\nmodels, and regretted that he was not living in those days.\nFrom this short collection a further characteristic of the dreams of\nchildren is manifest--_their connection with the life of the day_. The\ndesires which are realized in these dreams are left over from the day\nor, as a rule, the day previous, and the feeling has become intently\nemphasized and fixed during the day thoughts. Accidental and indifferent\nmatters, or what must appear so to the child, find no acceptance in the\ncontents of the dream.\nInnumerable instances of such dreams of the infantile type can be found\namong adults also, but, as mentioned, these are mostly exactly like the\nmanifest content. Thus, a random selection of persons will generally\nrespond to thirst at night-time with a dream about drinking, thus\nstriving to get rid of the sensation and to let sleep continue. Many\npersons frequently have these comforting _dreams_ before waking, just\nwhen they are called. They then dream that they are already up, that\nthey are washing, or already in school, at the office, etc., where they\nought to be at a given time. The night before an intended journey one\nnot infrequently dreams that one has already arrived at the destination;\nbefore going to a play or to a party the dream not infrequently\nanticipates, in impatience, as it were, the expected pleasure. At other\ntimes the dream expresses the realization of the desire somewhat\nindirectly; some connection, some sequel must be known--the first step\ntowards recognizing the desire. Thus, when a husband related to me the\ndream of his young wife, that her monthly period had begun, I had to\nbethink myself that the young wife would have expected a pregnancy if\nthe period had been absent. The dream is then a sign of pregnancy. Its\nmeaning is that it shows the wish realized that pregnancy should not\noccur just yet. Under unusual and extreme circumstances, these dreams\nof the infantile type become very frequent. The leader of a polar\nexpedition tells us, for instance, that during the wintering amid the\nice the crew, with their monotonous diet and slight rations, dreamt\nregularly, like children, of fine meals, of mountains of tobacco, and of\nhome.\nIt is not uncommon that out of some long, complicated and intricate\ndream one specially lucid part stands out containing unmistakably the\nrealization of a desire, but bound up with much unintelligible matter.\nOn more frequently analyzing the seemingly more transparent dreams of\nadults, it is astonishing to discover that these are rarely as simple as\nthe dreams of children, and that they cover another meaning beyond that\nof the realization of a wish.\nIt would certainly be a simple and convenient solution of the riddle if\nthe work of analysis made it at all possible for us to trace the\nmeaningless and intricate dreams of adults back to the infantile type,\nto the realization of some intensely experienced desire of the day. But\nthere is no warrant for such an expectation. Their dreams are generally\nfull of the most indifferent and bizarre matter, and no trace of the\nrealization of the wish is to be found in their content.\nBefore leaving these infantile dreams, which are obviously unrealized\ndesires, we must not fail to mention another chief characteristic of\ndreams, one that has been long noticed, and one which stands out most\nclearly in this class. I can replace any of these dreams by a phrase\nexpressing a desire. If the sea trip had only lasted longer; if I were\nonly washed and dressed; if I had only been allowed to keep the cherries\ninstead of giving them to my uncle. But the dream gives something more\nthan the choice, for here the desire is already realized; its\nrealization is real and actual. The dream presentations consist chiefly,\nif not wholly, of scenes and mainly of visual sense images. Hence a kind\nof transformation is not entirely absent in this class of dreams, and\nthis may be fairly designated as the dream work. _An idea merely\nexisting in the region of possibility is replaced by a vision of its\naccomplishment._\nII\nTHE DREAM MECHANISM\nWe are compelled to assume that such transformation of scene has also\ntaken place in intricate dreams, though we do not know whether it has\nencountered any possible desire. The dream instanced at the\ncommencement, which we analyzed somewhat thoroughly, did give us\noccasion in two places to suspect something of the kind. Analysis\nbrought out that my wife was occupied with others at table, and that I\ndid not like it; in the dream itself _exactly the opposite_ occurs, for\nthe person who replaces my wife gives me her undivided attention. But\ncan one wish for anything pleasanter after a disagreeable incident than\nthat the exact contrary should have occurred, just as the dream has it?\nThe stinging thought in the analysis, that I have never had anything for\nnothing, is similarly connected with the woman's remark in the dream:\n\"You have always had such beautiful eyes.\" Some portion of the\nopposition between the latent and manifest content of the dream must be\ntherefore derived from the realization of a wish.\nAnother manifestation of the dream work which all incoherent dreams have\nin common is still more noticeable. Choose any instance, and compare the\nnumber of separate elements in it, or the extent of the dream, if\nwritten down, with the dream thoughts yielded by analysis, and of which\nbut a trace can be refound in the dream itself. There can be no doubt\nthat the dream working has resulted in an extraordinary compression or\n_condensation_. It is not at first easy to form an opinion as to the\nextent of the condensation; the more deeply you go into the analysis,\nthe more deeply you are impressed by it. There will be found no factor\nin the dream whence the chains of associations do not lead in two or\nmore directions, no scene which has not been pieced together out of two\nor more impressions and events. For instance, I once dreamt about a kind\nof swimming-bath where the bathers suddenly separated in all directions;\nat one place on the edge a person stood bending towards one of the\nbathers as if to drag him out. The scene was a composite one, made up\nout of an event that occurred at the time of puberty, and of two\npictures, one of which I had seen just shortly before the dream. The two\npictures were The Surprise in the Bath, from Schwind's Cycle of the\nMelusine (note the bathers suddenly separating), and The Flood, by an\nItalian master. The little incident was that I once witnessed a lady,\nwho had tarried in the swimming-bath until the men's hour, being helped\nout of the water by the swimming-master. The scene in the dream which\nwas selected for analysis led to a whole group of reminiscences, each\none of which had contributed to the dream content. First of all came the\nlittle episode from the time of my courting, of which I have already\nspoken; the pressure of a hand under the table gave rise in the dream to\nthe \"under the table,\" which I had subsequently to find a place for in\nmy recollection. There was, of course, at the time not a word about\n\"undivided attention.\" Analysis taught me that this factor is the\nrealization of a desire through its contradictory and related to the\nbehavior of my wife at the table d'h\u00f4te. An exactly similar and much\nmore important episode of our courtship, one which separated us for an\nentire day, lies hidden behind this recent recollection. The intimacy,\nthe hand resting upon the knee, refers to a quite different connection\nand to quite other persons. This element in the dream becomes again the\nstarting-point of two distinct series of reminiscences, and so on.\nThe stuff of the dream thoughts which has been accumulated for the\nformation of the dream scene must be naturally fit for this application.\nThere must be one or more common factors. The dream work proceeds like\nFrancis Galton with his family photographs. The different elements are\nput one on top of the other; what is common to the composite picture\nstands out clearly, the opposing details cancel each other. This process\nof reproduction partly explains the wavering statements, of a peculiar\nvagueness, in so many elements of the dream. For the interpretation of\ndreams this rule holds good: When analysis discloses _uncertainty_, as\nto _either_--_or_ read _and_, _taking_ each section of the apparent\nalternatives as a separate outlet for a series of impressions.\nWhen there is nothing in common between the dream thoughts, the dream\nwork takes the trouble to create a something, in order to make a common\npresentation feasible in the dream. The simplest way to approximate two\ndream thoughts, which have as yet nothing in common, consists in making\nsuch a change in the actual expression of one idea as will meet a slight\nresponsive recasting in the form of the other idea. The process is\nanalogous to that of rhyme, when consonance supplies the desired common\nfactor. A good deal of the dream work consists in the creation of those\nfrequently very witty, but often exaggerated, digressions. These vary\nfrom the common presentation in the dream content to dream thoughts\nwhich are as varied as are the causes in form and essence which give\nrise to them. In the analysis of our example of a dream, I find a like\ncase of the transformation of a thought in order that it might agree\nwith another essentially foreign one. In following out the analysis I\nstruck upon the thought: _I should like to have something for nothing_.\nBut this formula is not serviceable to the dream. Hence it is replaced\nby another one: \"I should like to enjoy something free of cost.\"[1] The\nword \"kost\" (taste), with its double meaning, is appropriate to a table\nd'h\u00f4te; it, moreover, is in place through the special sense in the\ndream. At home if there is a dish which the children decline, their\nmother first tries gentle persuasion, with a \"Just taste it.\" That the\ndream work should unhesitatingly use the double meaning of the word is\ncertainly remarkable; ample experience has shown, however, that the\noccurrence is quite usual.\nThrough condensation of the dream certain constituent parts of its\ncontent are explicable which are peculiar to the dream life alone, and\nwhich are not found in the waking state. Such are the composite and\nmixed persons, the extraordinary mixed figures, creations comparable\nwith the fantastic animal compositions of Orientals; a moment's thought\nand these are reduced to unity, whilst the fancies of the dream are ever\nformed anew in an inexhaustible profusion. Every one knows such images\nin his own dreams; manifold are their origins. I can build up a person\nby borrowing one feature from one person and one from another, or by\ngiving to the form of one the name of another in my dream. I can also\nvisualize one person, but place him in a position which has occurred to\nanother. There is a meaning in all these cases when different persons\nare amalgamated into one substitute. Such cases denote an \"and,\" a \"just\nlike,\" a comparison of the original person from a certain point of view,\na comparison which can be also realized in the dream itself. As a rule,\nhowever, the identity of the blended persons is only discoverable by\nanalysis, and is only indicated in the dream content by the formation of\nthe \"combined\" person.\nThe same diversity in their ways of formation and the same rules for its\nsolution hold good also for the innumerable medley of dream contents,\nexamples of which I need scarcely adduce. Their strangeness quite\ndisappears when we resolve not to place them on a level with the objects\nof perception as known to us when awake, but to remember that they\nrepresent the art of dream condensation by an exclusion of unnecessary\ndetail. Prominence is given to the common character of the combination.\nAnalysis must also generally supply the common features. The dream says\nsimply: _All these things have an \"x\" in common_. The decomposition of\nthese mixed images by analysis is often the quickest way to an\ninterpretation of the dream. Thus I once dreamt that I was sitting with\none of my former university tutors on a bench, which was undergoing a\nrapid continuous movement amidst other benches. This was a combination\nof lecture-room and moving staircase. I will not pursue the further\nresult of the thought. Another time I was sitting in a carriage, and on\nmy lap an object in shape like a top-hat, which, however, was made of\ntransparent glass. The scene at once brought to my mind the proverb: \"He\nwho keeps his hat in his hand will travel safely through the land.\" By a\nslight turn the _glass hat_ reminded me of _Auer's light_, and I knew\nthat I was about to invent something which was to make me as rich and\nindependent as his invention had made my countryman, Dr. Auer, of\nWelsbach; then I should be able to travel instead of remaining in\nVienna. In the dream I was traveling with my invention, with the, it is\ntrue, rather awkward glass top-hat. The dream work is peculiarly adept\nat representing two contradictory conceptions by means of the same mixed\nimage. Thus, for instance, a woman dreamt of herself carrying a tall\nflower-stalk, as in the picture of the Annunciation (Chastity-Mary is\nher own name), but the stalk was bedecked with thick white blossoms\nresembling camellias (contrast with chastity: La dame aux Camelias).\nA great deal of what we have called \"dream condensation\" can be thus\nformulated. Each one of the elements of the dream content is\n_overdetermined_ by the matter of the dream thoughts; it is not derived\nfrom one element of these thoughts, but from a whole series. These are\nnot necessarily interconnected in any way, but may belong to the most\ndiverse spheres of thought. The dream element truly represents all this\ndisparate matter in the dream content. Analysis, moreover, discloses\nanother side of the relationship between dream content and dream\nthoughts. Just as one element of the dream leads to associations with\nseveral dream thoughts, so, as a rule, the _one dream thought represents\nmore than one dream element_. The threads of the association do not\nsimply converge from the dream thoughts to the dream content, but on the\nway they overlap and interweave in every way.\nNext to the transformation of one thought in the scene (its\n\"dramatization\"), condensation is the most important and most\ncharacteristic feature of the dream work. We have as yet no clue as to\nthe motive calling for such compression of the content.\nIn the complicated and intricate dreams with which we are now concerned,\ncondensation and dramatization do not wholly account for the difference\nbetween dream contents and dream thoughts. There is evidence of a third\nfactor, which deserves careful consideration.\nWhen I have arrived at an understanding of the dream thoughts by my\nanalysis I notice, above all, that the matter of the manifest is very\ndifferent from that of the latent dream content. That is, I admit, only\nan apparent difference which vanishes on closer investigation, for in\nthe end I find the whole dream content carried out in the dream\nthoughts, nearly all the dream thoughts again represented in the dream\ncontent. Nevertheless, there does remain a certain amount of difference.\nThe essential content which stood out clearly and broadly in the dream\nmust, after analysis, rest satisfied with a very subordinate r\u00f4le among\nthe dream thoughts. These very dream thoughts which, going by my\nfeelings, have a claim to the greatest importance are either not present\nat all in the dream content, or are represented by some remote allusion\nin some obscure region of the dream. I can thus describe these\nphenomena: _During the dream work the psychical intensity of those\nthoughts and conceptions to which it properly pertains flows to others\nwhich, in my judgment, have no claim to such emphasis_. There is no\nother process which contributes so much to concealment of the dream's\nmeaning and to make the connection between the dream content and dream\nideas irrecognizable. During this process, which I will call _the dream\ndisplacement_, I notice also the psychical intensity, significance, or\nemotional nature of the thoughts become transposed in sensory vividness.\nWhat was clearest in the dream seems to me, without further\nconsideration, the most important; but often in some obscure element of\nthe dream I can recognize the most direct offspring of the principal\ndream thought.\nI could only designate this dream displacement as the _transvaluation of\npsychical values_. The phenomena will not have been considered in all\nits bearings unless I add that this displacement or transvaluation is\nshared by different dreams in extremely varying degrees. There are\ndreams which take place almost without any displacement. These have the\nsame time, meaning, and intelligibility as we found in the dreams which\nrecorded a desire. In other dreams not a bit of the dream idea has\nretained its own psychical value, or everything essential in these dream\nideas has been replaced by unessentials, whilst every kind of transition\nbetween these conditions can be found. The more obscure and intricate a\ndream is, the greater is the part to be ascribed to the impetus of\ndisplacement in its formation.\nThe example that we chose for analysis shows, at least, this much of\ndisplacement--that its content has a different center of interest from\nthat of the dream ideas. In the forefront of the dream content the main\nscene appears as if a woman wished to make advances to me; in the dream\nidea the chief interest rests on the desire to enjoy disinterested love\nwhich shall \"cost nothing\"; this idea lies at the back of the talk about\nthe beautiful eyes and the far-fetched allusion to \"spinach.\"\nIf we abolish the dream displacement, we attain through analysis quite\ncertain conclusions regarding two problems of the dream which are most\ndisputed--as to what provokes a dream at all, and as to the connection\nof the dream with our waking life. There are dreams which at once expose\ntheir links with the events of the day; in others no trace of such a\nconnection can be found. By the aid of analysis it can be shown that\nevery dream, without any exception, is linked up with our impression of\nthe day, or perhaps it would be more correct to say of the day previous\nto the dream. The impressions which have incited the dream may be so\nimportant that we are not surprised at our being occupied with them\nwhilst awake; in this case we are right in saying that the dream carries\non the chief interest of our waking life. More usually, however, when\nthe dream contains anything relating to the impressions of the day, it\nis so trivial, unimportant, and so deserving of oblivion, that we can\nonly recall it with an effort. The dream content appears, then, even\nwhen coherent and intelligible, to be concerned with those indifferent\ntrifles of thought undeserving of our waking interest. The depreciation\nof dreams is largely due to the predominance of the indifferent and the\nworthless in their content.\nAnalysis destroys the appearance upon which this derogatory judgment is\nbased. When the dream content discloses nothing but some indifferent\nimpression as instigating the dream, analysis ever indicates some\nsignificant event, which has been replaced by something indifferent\nwith which it has entered into abundant associations. Where the dream is\nconcerned with uninteresting and unimportant conceptions, analysis\nreveals the numerous associative paths which connect the trivial with\nthe momentous in the psychical estimation of the individual. _It is only\nthe action of displacement if what is indifferent obtains recognition in\nthe dream content instead of those impressions which are really the\nstimulus, or instead of the things of real interest_. In answering the\nquestion as to what provokes the dream, as to the connection of the\ndream, in the daily troubles, we must say, in terms of the insight given\nus by replacing the manifest latent dream content: _The dream does never\ntrouble itself about things which are not deserving of our concern\nduring the day, and trivialities which do not trouble us during the day\nhave no power to pursue us whilst asleep_.\nWhat provoked the dream in the example which we have analyzed? The\nreally unimportant event, that a friend invited me to a _free ride in\nhis cab_. The table d'h\u00f4te scene in the dream contains an allusion to\nthis indifferent motive, for in conversation I had brought the taxi\nparallel with the table d'h\u00f4te. But I can indicate the important event\nwhich has as its substitute the trivial one. A few days before I had\ndisbursed a large sum of money for a member of my family who is very\ndear to me. Small wonder, says the dream thought, if this person is\ngrateful to me for this--this love is not cost-free. But love that shall\ncost nothing is one of the prime thoughts of the dream. The fact that\nshortly before this I had had several _drives_ with the relative in\nquestion puts the one drive with my friend in a position to recall the\nconnection with the other person. The indifferent impression which, by\nsuch ramifications, provokes the dream is subservient to another\ncondition which is not true of the real source of the dream--the\nimpression must be a recent one, everything arising from the day of the\ndream.\nI cannot leave the question of dream displacement without the\nconsideration of a remarkable process in the formation of dreams in\nwhich condensation and displacement work together towards one end. In\ncondensation we have already considered the case where two conceptions\nin the dream having something in common, some point of contact, are\nreplaced in the dream content by a mixed image, where the distinct germ\ncorresponds to what is common, and the indistinct secondary\nmodifications to what is distinctive. If displacement is added to\ncondensation, there is no formation of a mixed image, but a _common\nmean_ which bears the same relationship to the individual elements as\ndoes the resultant in the parallelogram of forces to its components. In\none of my dreams, for instance, there is talk of an injection with\n_propyl_. On first analysis I discovered an indifferent but true\nincident where _amyl_ played a part as the excitant of the dream. I\ncannot yet vindicate the exchange of amyl for propyl. To the round of\nideas of the same dream, however, there belongs the recollection of my\nfirst visit to Munich, when the _Propyloea_ struck me. The attendant\ncircumstances of the analysis render it admissible that the influence of\nthis second group of conceptions caused the displacement of amyl to\npropyl. _Propyl_ is, so to say, the mean idea between _amyl_ and\n_propyloea_; it got into the dream as a kind of _compromise_ by\nsimultaneous condensation and displacement.\nThe need of discovering some motive for this bewildering work of the\ndream is even more called for in the case of displacement than in\ncondensation.\nAlthough the work of displacement must be held mainly responsible if the\ndream thoughts are not refound or recognized in the dream content\n(unless the motive of the changes be guessed), it is another and milder\nkind of transformation which will be considered with the dream thoughts\nwhich leads to the discovery of a new but readily understood act of the\ndream work. The first dream thoughts which are unravelled by analysis\nfrequently strike one by their unusual wording. They do not appear to be\nexpressed in the sober form which our thinking prefers; rather are they\nexpressed symbolically by allegories and metaphors like the figurative\nlanguage of the poets. It is not difficult to find the motives for this\ndegree of constraint in the expression of dream ideas. The dream content\nconsists chiefly of visual scenes; hence the dream ideas must, in the\nfirst place, be prepared to make use of these forms of presentation.\nConceive that a political leader's or a barrister's address had to be\ntransposed into pantomime, and it will be easy to understand the\ntransformations to which the dream work is constrained by regard for\nthis _dramatization of the dream content_.\nAround the psychical stuff of dream thoughts there are ever found\nreminiscences of impressions, not infrequently of early\nchildhood--scenes which, as a rule, have been visually grasped. Whenever\npossible, this portion of the dream ideas exercises a definite influence\nupon the modelling of the dream content; it works like a center of\ncrystallization, by attracting and rearranging the stuff of the dream\nthoughts. The scene of the dream is not infrequently nothing but a\nmodified repetition, complicated by interpolations of events that have\nleft such an impression; the dream but very seldom reproduces accurate\nand unmixed reproductions of real scenes.\nThe dream content does not, however, consist exclusively of scenes, but\nit also includes scattered fragments of visual images, conversations,\nand even bits of unchanged thoughts. It will be perhaps to the point if\nwe instance in the briefest way the means of dramatization which are at\nthe disposal of the dream work for the repetition of the dream thoughts\nin the peculiar language of the dream.\nThe dream thoughts which we learn from the analysis exhibit themselves\nas a psychical complex of the most complicated superstructure. Their\nparts stand in the most diverse relationship to each other; they form\nbackgrounds and foregrounds, stipulations, digressions, illustrations,\ndemonstrations, and protestations. It may be said to be almost the rule\nthat one train of thought is followed by its contradictory. No feature\nknown to our reason whilst awake is absent. If a dream is to grow out of\nall this, the psychical matter is submitted to a pressure which\ncondenses it extremely, to an inner shrinking and displacement, creating\nat the same time fresh surfaces, to a selective interweaving among the\nconstituents best adapted for the construction of these scenes. Having\nregard to the origin of this stuff, the term _regression_ can be fairly\napplied to this process. The logical chains which hitherto held the\npsychical stuff together become lost in this transformation to the dream\ncontent. The dream work takes on, as it were, only the essential content\nof the dream thoughts for elaboration. It is left to analysis to restore\nthe connection which the dream work has destroyed.\nThe dream's means of expression must therefore be regarded as meager in\ncomparison with those of our imagination, though the dream does not\nrenounce all claims to the restitution of logical relation to the dream\nthoughts. It rather succeeds with tolerable frequency in replacing these\nby formal characters of its own.\nBy reason of the undoubted connection existing between all the parts of\ndream thoughts, the dream is able to embody this matter into a single\nscene. It upholds a _logical connection_ as _approximation in time and\nspace_, just as the painter, who groups all the poets for his picture of\nParnassus who, though they have never been all together on a mountain\npeak, yet form ideally a community. The dream continues this method of\npresentation in individual dreams, and often when it displays two\nelements close together in the dream content it warrants some special\ninner connection between what they represent in the dream thoughts. It\nshould be, moreover, observed that all the dreams of one night prove on\nanalysis to originate from the same sphere of thought.\nThe causal connection between two ideas is either left without\npresentation, or replaced by two different long portions of dreams one\nafter the other. This presentation is frequently a reversed one, the\nbeginning of the dream being the deduction, and its end the hypothesis.\nThe direct _transformation_ of one thing into another in the dream seems\nto serve the relationship of _cause_ and _effect_.\nThe dream never utters the _alternative \"either-or,\"_ but accepts both\nas having equal rights in the same connection. When \"either-or\" is used\nin the reproduction of dreams, it is, as I have already mentioned, to be\nreplaced by \"_and_.\"\nConceptions which stand in opposition to one another are preferably\nexpressed in dreams by the same element.[2] There seems no \"not\" in\ndreams. Opposition between two ideas, the relation of conversion, is\nrepresented in dreams in a very remarkable way. It is expressed by the\nreversal of another part of the dream content just as if by way of\nappendix. We shall later on deal with another form of expressing\ndisagreement. The common dream sensation of _movement checked_ serves\nthe purpose of representing disagreement of impulses--a _conflict of the\nwill_.\nOnly one of the logical relationships--that of _similarity, identity,\nagreement_--is found highly developed in the mechanism of dream\nformation. Dream work makes use of these cases as a starting-point for\ncondensation, drawing together everything which shows such agreement to\na _fresh unity_.\nThese short, crude observations naturally do not suffice as an estimate\nof the abundance of the dream's formal means of presenting the logical\nrelationships of the dream thoughts. In this respect, individual dreams\nare worked up more nicely or more carelessly, our text will have been\nfollowed more or less closely, auxiliaries of the dream work will have\nbeen taken more or less into consideration. In the latter case they\nappear obscure, intricate, incoherent. When the dream appears openly\nabsurd, when it contains an obvious paradox in its content, it is so of\npurpose. Through its apparent disregard of all logical claims, it\nexpresses a part of the intellectual content of the dream ideas.\nAbsurdity in the dream denotes _disagreement, scorn, disdain_ in the\ndream thoughts. As this explanation is in entire disagreement with the\nview that the dream owes its origin to dissociated, uncritical cerebral\nactivity, I will emphasize my view by an example:\n_\"One of my acquaintances, Mr. M----, has been attacked by no less a\nperson than Goethe in an essay with, we all maintain, unwarrantable\nviolence. Mr. M---- has naturally been ruined by this attack. He\ncomplains very bitterly of this at a dinner-party, but his respect for\nGoethe has not diminished through this personal experience. I now\nattempt to clear up the chronological relations which strike me as\nimprobable. Goethe died in 1832. As his attack upon Mr. M---- must, of\ncourse, have taken place before, Mr. M---- must have been then a very\nyoung man. It seems to me plausible that he was eighteen. I am not\ncertain, however, what year we are actually in, and the whole\ncalculation falls into obscurity. The attack was, moreover, contained\nin Goethe's well-known essay on 'Nature.'\"_\nThe absurdity of the dream becomes the more glaring when I state that\nMr. M---- is a young business man without any poetical or literary\ninterests. My analysis of the dream will show what method there is in\nthis madness. The dream has derived its material from three sources:\n1. Mr. M----, to whom I was introduced at a dinner-party, begged me one\nday to examine his elder brother, who showed signs of mental trouble. In\nconversation with the patient, an unpleasant episode occurred. Without\nthe slightest occasion he disclosed one of his brother's _youthful\nescapades_. I had asked the patient the _year of his birth_ (_year of\ndeath_ in dream), and led him to various calculations which might show\nup his want of memory.\n2. A medical journal which displayed my name among others on the cover\nhad published a _ruinous_ review of a book by my friend F---- of Berlin,\nfrom the pen of a very _juvenile_ reviewer. I communicated with the\neditor, who, indeed, expressed his regret, but would not promise any\nredress. Thereupon I broke off my connection with the paper; in my\nletter of resignation I expressed the hope that our _personal relations\nwould not suffer from this_. Here is the real source of the dream. The\nderogatory reception of my friend's work had made a deep impression upon\nme. In my judgment, it contained a fundamental biological discovery\nwhich only now, several years later, commences to find favor among the\nprofessors.\n3. A little while before, a patient gave me the medical history of her\nbrother, who, exclaiming \"_Nature, Nature!_\" had gone out of his mind.\nThe doctors considered that the exclamation arose from a study of\n_Goethe's_ beautiful essay, and indicated that the patient had been\noverworking. I expressed the opinion that it seemed more _plausible_ to\nme that the exclamation \"Nature!\" was to be taken in that sexual meaning\nknown also to the less educated in our country. It seemed to me that\nthis view had something in it, because the unfortunate youth afterwards\nmutilated his genital organs. The patient was eighteen years old when\nthe attack occurred.\nThe first person in the dream-thoughts behind the ego was my friend who\nhad been so scandalously treated. _\"I now attempted to clear up the\nchronological relation.\"_ My friend's book deals with the chronological\nrelations of life, and, amongst other things, correlates _Goethe's_\nduration of life with a number of days in many ways important to\nbiology. The ego is, however, represented as a general paralytic (_\"I\nam not certain what year we are actually in\"_). The dream exhibits my\nfriend as behaving like a general paralytic, and thus riots in\nabsurdity. But the dream thoughts run ironically. \"Of course he is a\nmadman, a fool, and you are the genius who understands all about it. But\nshouldn't it be the _other way round_?\" This inversion obviously took\nplace in the dream when Goethe attacked the young man, which is absurd,\nwhilst any one, however young, can to-day easily attack the great\nGoethe.\nI am prepared to maintain that no dream is inspired by other than\negoistic emotions. The ego in the dream does not, indeed, represent only\nmy friend, but stands for myself also. I identify myself with him\nbecause the fate of his discovery appears to me typical of the\nacceptance of _my own_. If I were to publish my own theory, which gives\nsexuality predominance in the \u00e6tiology of psychoneurotic disorders (see\nthe allusion to the eighteen-year-old patient--_\"Nature, Nature!\"_), the\nsame criticism would be leveled at me, and it would even now meet with\nthe same contempt.\nWhen I follow out the dream thoughts closely, I ever find only _scorn_\nand _contempt_ as _correlated with the dream's absurdity_. It is well\nknown that the discovery of a cracked sheep's skull on the Lido in\nVenice gave Goethe the hint for the so-called vertebral theory of the\nskull. My friend plumes himself on having as a student raised a hubbub\nfor the resignation of an aged professor who had done good work\n(including some in this very subject of comparative anatomy), but who,\non account of _decrepitude_, had become quite incapable of teaching. The\nagitation my friend inspired was so successful because in the German\nUniversities an _age limit_ is not demanded for academic work. _Age is\nno protection against folly._ In the hospital here I had for years the\nhonor to serve under a chief who, long fossilized, was for decades\nnotoriously _feebleminded_, and was yet permitted to continue in his\nresponsible office. A trait, after the manner of the find in the Lido,\nforces itself upon me here. It was to this man that some youthful\ncolleagues in the hospital adapted the then popular slang of that day:\n\"No Goethe has written that,\" \"No Schiller composed that,\" etc.\nWe have not exhausted our valuation of the dream work. In addition to\ncondensation, displacement, and definite arrangement of the psychical\nmatter, we must ascribe to it yet another activity--one which is,\nindeed, not shared by every dream. I shall not treat this position of\nthe dream work exhaustively; I will only point out that the readiest\nway to arrive at a conception of it is to take for granted, probably\nunfairly, that it _only subsequently influences the dream content which\nhas already been built up_. Its mode of action thus consists in so\nco\u00f6rdinating the parts of the dream that these coalesce to a coherent\nwhole, to a dream composition. The dream gets a kind of fa\u00e7ade which, it\nis true, does not conceal the whole of its content. There is a sort of\npreliminary explanation to be strengthened by interpolations and slight\nalterations. Such elaboration of the dream content must not be too\npronounced; the misconception of the dream thoughts to which it gives\nrise is merely superficial, and our first piece of work in analyzing a\ndream is to get rid of these early attempts at interpretation.\nThe motives for this part of the dream work are easily gauged. This\nfinal elaboration of the dream is due to a _regard for\nintelligibility_--a fact at once betraying the origin of an action which\nbehaves towards the actual dream content just as our normal psychical\naction behaves towards some proffered perception that is to our liking.\nThe dream content is thus secured under the pretense of certain\nexpectations, is perceptually classified by the supposition of its\nintelligibility, thereby risking its falsification, whilst, in fact, the\nmost extraordinary misconceptions arise if the dream can be correlated\nwith nothing familiar. Every one is aware that we are unable to look at\nany series of unfamiliar signs, or to listen to a discussion of unknown\nwords, without at once making perpetual changes through _our regard for\nintelligibility_, through our falling back upon what is familiar.\nWe can call those dreams _properly made up_ which are the result of an\nelaboration in every way analogous to the psychical action of our waking\nlife. In other dreams there is no such action; not even an attempt is\nmade to bring about order and meaning. We regard the dream as \"quite\nmad,\" because on awaking it is with this last-named part of the dream\nwork, the dream elaboration, that we identify ourselves. So far,\nhowever, as our analysis is concerned, the dream, which resembles a\nmedley of disconnected fragments, is of as much value as the one with a\nsmooth and beautifully polished surface. In the former case we are\nspared, to some extent, the trouble of breaking down the\nsuper-elaboration of the dream content.\nAll the same, it would be an error to see in the dream fa\u00e7ade nothing\nbut the misunderstood and somewhat arbitrary elaboration of the dream\ncarried out at the instance of our psychical life. Wishes and phantasies\nare not infrequently employed in the erection of this fa\u00e7ade, which\nwere already fashioned in the dream thoughts; they are akin to those of\nour waking life--\"day-dreams,\" as they are very properly called. These\nwishes and phantasies, which analysis discloses in our dreams at night,\noften present themselves as repetitions and refashionings of the scenes\nof infancy. Thus the dream fa\u00e7ade may show us directly the true core of\nthe dream, distorted through admixture with other matter.\nBeyond these four activities there is nothing else to be discovered in\nthe dream work. If we keep closely to the definition that dream work\ndenotes the transference of dream thoughts to dream content, we are\ncompelled to say that the dream work is not creative; it develops no\nfancies of its own, it judges nothing, decides nothing. It does nothing\nbut prepare the matter for condensation and displacement, and refashions\nit for dramatization, to which must be added the inconstant last-named\nmechanism--that of explanatory elaboration. It is true that a good deal\nis found in the dream content which might be understood as the result of\nanother and more intellectual performance; but analysis shows\nconclusively every time that these _intellectual operations were already\npresent in the dream thoughts, and have only been taken over by the\ndream content_. A syllogism in the dream is nothing other than the\nrepetition of a syllogism in the dream thoughts; it seems inoffensive if\nit has been transferred to the dream without alteration; it becomes\nabsurd if in the dream work it has been transferred to other matter. A\ncalculation in the dream content simply means that there was a\ncalculation in the dream thoughts; whilst this is always correct, the\ncalculation in the dream can furnish the silliest results by the\ncondensation of its factors and the displacement of the same operations\nto other things. Even speeches which are found in the dream content are\nnot new compositions; they prove to be pieced together out of speeches\nwhich have been made or heard or read; the words are faithfully copied,\nbut the occasion of their utterance is quite overlooked, and their\nmeaning is most violently changed.\nIt is, perhaps, not superfluous to support these assertions by examples:\n1. _A seemingly inoffensive, well-made dream of a patient. She was going\nto market with her cook, who carried the basket. The butcher said to her\nwhen she asked him for something: \"That is all gone,\" and wished to give\nher something else, remarking; \"That's very good.\" She declines, and\ngoes to the greengrocer, who wants to sell her a peculiar vegetable\nwhich is bound up in bundles and of a black color. She says: \"I don't\nknow that; I won't take it.\"_\nThe remark \"That is all gone\" arose from the treatment. A few days\nbefore I said myself to the patient that the earliest reminiscences of\nchildhood _are all gone_ as such, but are replaced by transferences and\ndreams. Thus I am the butcher.\nThe second remark, _\"I don't know that\"_ arose in a very different\nconnection. The day before she had herself called out in rebuke to the\ncook (who, moreover, also appears in the dream): \"_Behave yourself\nproperly_; I don't know _that_\"--that is, \"I don't know this kind of\nbehavior; I won't have it.\" The more harmless portion of this speech was\narrived at by a displacement of the dream content; in the dream thoughts\nonly the other portion of the speech played a part, because the dream\nwork changed an imaginary situation into utter irrecognizability and\ncomplete inoffensiveness (while in a certain sense I behave in an\nunseemly way to the lady). The situation resulting in this phantasy is,\nhowever, nothing but a new edition of one that actually took place.\n2. A dream apparently meaningless relates to figures. _\"She wants to pay\nsomething; her daughter takes three florins sixty-five kreuzers out of\nher purse; but she says: 'What are you doing? It only cost twenty-one\nkreuzers.'\"_\nThe dreamer was a stranger who had placed her child at school in Vienna,\nand who was able to continue under my treatment so long as her daughter\nremained at Vienna. The day before the dream the directress of the\nschool had recommended her to keep the child another year at school. In\nthis case she would have been able to prolong her treatment by one year.\nThe figures in the dream become important if it be remembered that time\nis money. One year equals 365 days, or, expressed in kreuzers, 365\nkreuzers, which is three florins sixty-five kreuzers. The twenty-one\nkreuzers correspond with the three weeks which remained from the day of\nthe dream to the end of the school term, and thus to the end of the\ntreatment. It was obviously financial considerations which had moved the\nlady to refuse the proposal of the directress, and which were answerable\nfor the triviality of the amount in the dream.\n3. A lady, young, but already ten years married, heard that a friend of\nhers, Miss Elise L----, of about the same age, had become engaged. This\ngave rise to the following dream:\n_She was sitting with her husband in the theater; the one side of the\nstalls was quite empty. Her husband tells her, Elise L---- and her\nfianc\u00e9 had intended coming, but could only get some cheap seats, three\nfor one florin fifty kreuzers, and these they would not take. In her\nopinion, that would not have mattered very much._\nThe origin of the figures from the matter of the dream thoughts and the\nchanges the figures underwent are of interest. Whence came the one\nflorin fifty kreuzers? From a trifling occurrence of the previous day.\nHer sister-in-law had received 150 florins as a present from her\nhusband, and had quickly got rid of it by buying some ornament. Note\nthat 150 florins is one hundred times one florin fifty kreuzers. For the\n_three_ concerned with the tickets, the only link is that Elise L---- is\nexactly three months younger than the dreamer. The scene in the dream is\nthe repetition of a little adventure for which she has often been teased\nby her husband. She was once in a great hurry to get tickets in time for\na piece, and when she came to the theater _one side of the stalls was\nalmost empty_. It was therefore quite unnecessary for her to have been\nin _such a hurry_. Nor must we overlook the absurdity of the dream that\ntwo persons should take three tickets for the theater.\nNow for the dream ideas. It was _stupid_ to have married so early; I\n_need not_ have been _in so great a hurry_. Elise L----'s example shows\nme that I should have been able to get a husband later; indeed, one a\n_hundred times better_ if I had but waited. I could have bought _three_\nsuch men with the money (dowry).\n[1] \"Ich m\u00f6chte gerne etwas geniessen ohne 'Kosten' zu haben.\" A a pun\nupon the word \"kosten,\" which has two meanings--\"taste\" and \"cost.\" In\n\"Die Traumdeutung,\" third edition, p. 71 footnote, Professor Freud\nremarks that \"the finest example of dream interpretation left us by the\nancients is based upon a pun\" (from \"The Interpretation of Dreams,\" by\nArtemidorus Daldianus). \"Moreover, dreams are so intimately bound up\nwith language that Ferenczi truly points out that every tongue has its\nown language of dreams. A dream is as a rule untranslatable into other\nlanguages.\"--TRANSLATOR.\n[2] It is worthy of remark that eminent philologists maintain that the\noldest languages used the same word for expressing quite general\nantitheses.

To the dream work has been\ntransferred that bewilderment which its product, the dream, has aroused\nin us. In truth, the dream work is only the first recognition of a group\nof psychical processes to which must be referred the origin of\nhysterical symptoms, the ideas of morbid dread, obsession, and illusion.\nCondensation, and especially displacement, are never-failing features in\nthese other processes. The regard for appearance remains, on the other\nhand, peculiar to the dream work. If this explanation brings the dream\ninto line with the formation of psychical disease, it becomes the more\nimportant to fathom the essential conditions of processes like dream\nbuilding. It will be probably a surprise to hear that neither the state\nof sleep nor illness is among the indispensable conditions. A whole\nnumber of phenomena of the everyday life of healthy persons,\nforgetfulness, slips in speaking and in holding things, together with a\ncertain class of mistakes, are due to a psychical mechanism analogous to\nthat of the dream and the other members of this group.\nDisplacement is the core of the problem, and the most striking of all\nthe dream performances. A thorough investigation of the subject shows\nthat the essential condition of displacement is purely psychological; it\nis in the nature of a motive. We get on the track by thrashing out\nexperiences which one cannot avoid in the analysis of dreams. I had to\nbreak off the relations of my dream thoughts in the analysis of my dream\non p. 8 because I found some experiences which I do not wish strangers\nto know, and which I could not relate without serious damage to\nimportant considerations. I added, it would be no use were I to select\nanother instead of that particular dream; in every dream where the\ncontent is obscure or intricate, I should hit upon dream thoughts which\ncall for secrecy. If, however, I continue the analysis for myself,\nwithout regard to those others, for whom, indeed, so personal an event\nas my dream cannot matter, I arrive finally at ideas which surprise me,\nwhich I have not known to be mine, which not only appear _foreign_ to\nme, but which are _unpleasant_, and which I would like to oppose\nvehemently, whilst the chain of ideas running through the analysis\nintrudes upon me inexorably. I can only take these circumstances into\naccount by admitting that these thoughts are actually part of my\npsychical life, possessing a certain psychical intensity or energy.\nHowever, by virtue of a particular psychological condition, the\n_thoughts could not become conscious to me_. I call this particular\ncondition \"_Repression_.\" It is therefore impossible for me not to\nrecognize some casual relationship between the obscurity of the dream\ncontent and this state of repression--this _incapacity of\nconsciousness_. Whence I conclude that the cause of the obscurity is\n_the desire to conceal these thoughts_. Thus I arrive at the conception\nof the _dream distortion_ as the deed of the dream work, and of\n_displacement_ serving to disguise this object.\nI will test this in my own dream, and ask myself, What is the thought\nwhich, quite innocuous in its distorted form, provokes my liveliest\nopposition in its real form? I remember that the free drive reminded me\nof the last expensive drive with a member of my family, the\ninterpretation of the dream being: I should for once like to experience\naffection for which I should not have to pay, and that shortly before\nthe dream I had to make a heavy disbursement for this very person. In\nthis connection, I cannot get away from the thought _that I regret this\ndisbursement_. It is only when I acknowledge this feeling that there is\nany sense in my wishing in the dream for an affection that should entail\nno outlay. And yet I can state on my honor that I did not hesitate for a\nmoment when it became necessary to expend that sum. The regret, the\ncounter-current, was unconscious to me. Why it was unconscious is quite\nanother question which would lead us far away from the answer which,\nthough within my knowledge, belongs elsewhere.\nIf I subject the dream of another person instead of one of my own to\nanalysis, the result is the same; the motives for convincing others is,\nhowever, changed. In the dream of a healthy person the only way for me\nto enable him to accept this repressed idea is the coherence of the\ndream thoughts. He is at liberty to reject this explanation. But if we\nare dealing with a person suffering from any neurosis--say from\nhysteria--the recognition of these repressed ideas is compulsory by\nreason of their connection with the symptoms of his illness and of the\nimprovement resulting from exchanging the symptoms for the repressed\nideas. Take the patient from whom I got the last dream about the three\ntickets for one florin fifty kreuzers. Analysis shows that she does not\nthink highly of her husband, that she regrets having married him, that\nshe would be glad to change him for some one else. It is true that she\nmaintains that she loves her husband, that her emotional life knows\nnothing about this depreciation (a hundred times better!), but all her\nsymptoms lead to the same conclusion as this dream. When her repressed\nmemories had rewakened a certain period when she was conscious that she\ndid not love her husband, her symptoms disappeared, and therewith\ndisappeared her resistance to the interpretation of the dream.\nThis conception of repression once fixed, together with the distortion\nof the dream in relation to repressed psychical matter, we are in a\nposition to give a general exposition of the principal results which the\nanalysis of dreams supplies. We learnt that the most intelligible and\nmeaningful dreams are unrealized desires; the desires they pictured as\nrealized are known to consciousness, have been held over from the\ndaytime, and are of absorbing interest. The analysis of obscure and\nintricate dreams discloses something very similar; the dream scene again\npictures as realized some desire which regularly proceeds from the dream\nideas, but the picture is unrecognizable, and is only cleared up in the\nanalysis. The desire itself is either one repressed, foreign to\nconsciousness, or it is closely bound up with repressed ideas. The\nformula for these dreams may be thus stated: _They are concealed\nrealizations of repressed desires_. It is interesting to note that they\nare right who regard the dream as foretelling the future. Although the\nfuture which the dream shows us is not that which will occur, but that\nwhich we would like to occur. Folk psychology proceeds here according to\nits wont; it believes what it wishes to believe.\nDreams can be divided into three classes according to their relation\ntowards the realization of desire. Firstly come those which exhibit a\n_non-repressed, non-concealed desire_; these are dreams of the infantile\ntype, becoming ever rarer among adults. Secondly, dreams which express\nin _veiled_ form some _repressed desire_; these constitute by far the\nlarger number of our dreams, and they require analysis for their\nunderstanding. Thirdly, these dreams where repression exists, but\n_without_ or with but slight concealment. These dreams are invariably\naccompanied by a feeling of dread which brings the dream to an end. This\nfeeling of dread here replaces dream displacement; I regarded the dream\nwork as having prevented this in the dream of the second class. It is\nnot very difficult to prove that what is now present as intense dread in\nthe dream was once desire, and is now secondary to the repression.\nThere are also definite dreams with a painful content, without the\npresence of any anxiety in the dream. These cannot be reckoned among\ndreams of dread; they have, however, always been used to prove the\nunimportance and the psychical futility of dreams. An analysis of such\nan example will show that it belongs to our second class of dreams--a\n_perfectly concealed_ realization of repressed desires. Analysis will\ndemonstrate at the same time how excellently adapted is the work of\ndisplacement to the concealment of desires.\nA girl dreamt that she saw lying dead before her the only surviving\nchild of her sister amid the same surroundings as a few years before she\nsaw the first child lying dead. She was not sensible of any pain, but\nnaturally combatted the view that the scene represented a desire of\nhers. Nor was that view necessary. Years ago it was at the funeral of\nthe child that she had last seen and spoken to the man she loved. Were\nthe second child to die, she would be sure to meet this man again in her\nsister's house. She is longing to meet him, but struggles against this\nfeeling. The day of the dream she had taken a ticket for a lecture,\nwhich announced the presence of the man she always loved. The dream is\nsimply a dream of impatience common to those which happen before a\njourney, theater, or simply anticipated pleasures. The longing is\nconcealed by the shifting of the scene to the occasion when any joyous\nfeeling were out of place, and yet where it did once exist. Note,\nfurther, that the emotional behavior in the dream is adapted, not to the\ndisplaced, but to the real but suppressed dream ideas. The scene\nanticipates the long-hoped-for meeting; there is here no call for\npainful emotions.\nThere has hitherto been no occasion for philosophers to bestir\nthemselves with a psychology of repression. We must be allowed to\nconstruct some clear conception as to the origin of dreams as the first\nsteps in this unknown territory. The scheme which we have formulated not\nonly from a study of dreams is, it is true, already somewhat\ncomplicated, but we cannot find any simpler one that will suffice. We\nhold that our psychical apparatus contains two procedures for the\nconstruction of thoughts. The second one has the advantage that its\nproducts find an open path to consciousness, whilst the activity of the\nfirst procedure is unknown to itself, and can only arrive at\nconsciousness through the second one. At the borderland of these two\nprocedures, where the first passes over into the second, a censorship\nis established which only passes what pleases it, keeping back\neverything else. That which is rejected by the censorship is, according\nto our definition, in a state of repression. Under certain conditions,\none of which is the sleeping state, the balance of power between the two\nprocedures is so changed that what is repressed can no longer be kept\nback. In the sleeping state this may possibly occur through the\nnegligence of the censor; what has been hitherto repressed will now\nsucceed in finding its way to consciousness. But as the censorship is\nnever absent, but merely off guard, certain alterations must be conceded\nso as to placate it. It is a compromise which becomes conscious in this\ncase--a compromise between what one procedure has in view and the\ndemands of the other. _Repression, laxity of the censor,\ncompromise_--this is the foundation for the origin of many another\npsychological process, just as it is for the dream. In such compromises\nwe can observe the processes of condensation, of displacement, the\nacceptance of superficial associations, which we have found in the dream\nwork.\nIt is not for us to deny the demonic element which has played a part in\nconstructing our explanation of dream work. The impression left is that\nthe formation of obscure dreams proceeds as if a person had something\nto say which must be agreeable for another person upon whom he is\ndependent to hear. It is by the use of this image that we figure to\nourselves the conception of the _dream distortion_ and of the\ncensorship, and ventured to crystallize our impression in a rather\ncrude, but at least definite, psychological theory. Whatever explanation\nthe future may offer of these first and second procedures, we shall\nexpect a confirmation of our correlate that the second procedure\ncommands the entrance to consciousness, and can exclude the first from\nconsciousness.\nOnce the sleeping state overcome, the censorship resumes complete sway,\nand is now able to revoke that which was granted in a moment of\nweakness. That the _forgetting_ of dreams explains this in part, at\nleast, we are convinced by our experience, confirmed again and again.\nDuring the relation of a dream, or during analysis of one, it not\ninfrequently happens that some fragment of the dream is suddenly\nforgotten. This fragment so forgotten invariably contains the best and\nreadiest approach to an understanding of the dream. Probably that is why\nit sinks into oblivion--_i.e._, into a renewed suppression.\nViewing the dream content as the representation of a realized desire,\nand referring its vagueness to the changes made by the censor in the\nrepressed matter, it is no longer difficult to grasp the function of\ndreams. In fundamental contrast with those saws which assume that sleep\nis disturbed by dreams, we hold the _dream as the guardian of sleep_. So\nfar as children's dreams are concerned, our view should find ready\nacceptance.\nThe sleeping state or the psychical change to sleep, whatsoever it be,\nis brought about by the child being sent to sleep or compelled thereto\nby fatigue, only assisted by the removal of all stimuli which might open\nother objects to the psychical apparatus. The means which serve to keep\nexternal stimuli distant are known; but what are the means we can employ\nto depress the internal psychical stimuli which frustrate sleep? Look at\na mother getting her child to sleep. The child is full of beseeching; he\nwants another kiss; he wants to play yet awhile. His requirements are in\npart met, in part drastically put off till the following day. Clearly\nthese desires and needs, which agitate him, are hindrances to sleep.\nEvery one knows the charming story of the bad boy (Baldwin Groller's)\nwho awoke at night bellowing out, \"_I want the rhinoceros_.\" A really\ngood boy, instead of bellowing, would have _dreamt_ that he was playing\nwith the rhinoceros. Because the dream which realizes his desire is\nbelieved during sleep, it removes the desire and makes sleep possible.\nIt cannot be denied that this belief accords with the dream image,\nbecause it is arrayed in the psychical appearance of probability; the\nchild is without the capacity which it will acquire later to distinguish\nhallucinations or phantasies from reality.\nThe adult has learnt this differentiation; he has also learnt the\nfutility of desire, and by continuous practice manages to postpone his\naspirations, until they can be granted in some roundabout method by a\nchange in the external world. For this reason it is rare for him to have\nhis wishes realized during sleep in the short psychical way. It is even\npossible that this never happens, and that everything which appears to\nus like a child's dream demands a much more elaborate explanation. Thus\nit is that for adults--for every sane person without exception--a\ndifferentiation of the psychical matter has been fashioned which the\nchild knew not. A psychical procedure has been reached which, informed\nby the experience of life, exercises with jealous power a dominating and\nrestraining influence upon psychical emotions; by its relation to\nconsciousness, and by its spontaneous mobility, it is endowed with the\ngreatest means of psychical power. A portion of the infantile emotions\nhas been withheld from this procedure as useless to life, and all the\nthoughts which flow from these are found in the state of repression.\nWhilst the procedure in which we recognize our normal ego reposes upon\nthe desire for sleep, it appears compelled by the psycho-physiological\nconditions of sleep to abandon some of the energy with which it was wont\nduring the day to keep down what was repressed. This neglect is really\nharmless; however much the emotions of the child's spirit may be\nstirred, they find the approach to consciousness rendered difficult, and\nthat to movement blocked in consequence of the state of sleep. The\ndanger of their disturbing sleep must, however, be avoided. Moreover, we\nmust admit that even in deep sleep some amount of free attention is\nexerted as a protection against sense-stimuli which might, perchance,\nmake an awakening seem wiser than the continuance of sleep. Otherwise we\ncould not explain the fact of our being always awakened by stimuli of\ncertain quality. As the old physiologist Burdach pointed out, the mother\nis awakened by the whimpering of her child, the miller by the cessation\nof his mill, most people by gently calling out their names. This\nattention, thus on the alert, makes use of the internal stimuli arising\nfrom repressed desires, and fuses them into the dream, which as a\ncompromise satisfies both procedures at the same time. The dream creates\na form of psychical release for the wish which is either suppressed or\nformed by the aid of repression, inasmuch as it presents it as realized.\nThe other procedure is also satisfied, since the continuance of the\nsleep is assured. Our ego here gladly behaves like a child; it makes the\ndream pictures believable, saying, as it were, \"Quite right, but let me\nsleep.\" The contempt which, once awakened, we bear the dream, and which\nrests upon the absurdity and apparent illogicality of the dream, is\nprobably nothing but the reasoning of our sleeping ego on the feelings\nabout what was repressed; with greater right it should rest upon the\nincompetency of this disturber of our sleep. In sleep we are now and\nthen aware of this contempt; the dream content transcends the censorship\nrather too much, we think, \"It's only a dream,\" and sleep on.\nIt is no objection to this view if there are borderlines for the dream\nwhere its function, to preserve sleep from interruption, can no longer\nbe maintained--as in the dreams of impending dread. It is here changed\nfor another function--to suspend the sleep at the proper time. It acts\nlike a conscientious night-watchman, who first does his duty by quelling\ndisturbances so as not to waken the citizen, but equally does his duty\nquite properly when he awakens the street should the causes of the\ntrouble seem to him serious and himself unable to cope with them alone.\nThis function of dreams becomes especially well marked when there arises\nsome incentive for the sense perception. That the senses aroused during\nsleep influence the dream is well known, and can be experimentally\nverified; it is one of the certain but much overestimated results of the\nmedical investigation of dreams. Hitherto there has been an insoluble\nriddle connected with this discovery. The stimulus to the sense by which\nthe investigator affects the sleeper is not properly recognized in the\ndream, but is intermingled with a number of indefinite interpretations,\nwhose determination appears left to psychical free-will. There is, of\ncourse, no such psychical free-will. To an external sense-stimulus the\nsleeper can react in many ways. Either he awakens or he succeeds in\nsleeping on. In the latter case he can make use of the dream to dismiss\nthe external stimulus, and this, again, in more ways than one. For\ninstance, he can stay the stimulus by dreaming of a scene which is\nabsolutely intolerable to him. This was the means used by one who was\ntroubled by a painful perineal abscess. He dreamt that he was on\nhorseback, and made use of the poultice, which was intended to\nalleviate his pain, as a saddle, and thus got away from the cause of the\ntrouble. Or, as is more frequently the case, the external stimulus\nundergoes a new rendering, which leads him to connect it with a\nrepressed desire seeking its realization, and robs him of its reality,\nand is treated as if it were a part of the psychical matter. Thus, some\none dreamt that he had written a comedy which embodied a definite\n_motif_; it was being performed; the first act was over amid\nenthusiastic applause; there was great clapping. At this moment the\ndreamer must have succeeded in prolonging his sleep despite the\ndisturbance, for when he woke he no longer heard the noise; he concluded\nrightly that some one must have been beating a carpet or bed. The dreams\nwhich come with a loud noise just before waking have all attempted to\ncover the stimulus to waking by some other explanation, and thus to\nprolong the sleep for a little while.\nWhosoever has firmly accepted this _censorship_ as the chief motive for\nthe distortion of dreams will not be surprised to learn as the result of\ndream interpretation that most of the dreams of adults are traced by\nanalysis to erotic desires. This assertion is not drawn from dreams\nobviously of a sexual nature, which are known to all dreamers from their\nown experience, and are the only ones usually described as \"sexual\ndreams.\" These dreams are ever sufficiently mysterious by reason of the\nchoice of persons who are made the objects of sex, the removal of all\nthe barriers which cry halt to the dreamer's sexual needs in his waking\nstate, the many strange reminders as to details of what are called\nperversions. But analysis discovers that, in many other dreams in whose\nmanifest content nothing erotic can be found, the work of interpretation\nshows them up as, in reality, realization of sexual desires; whilst, on\nthe other hand, that much of the thought-making when awake, the thoughts\nsaved us as surplus from the day only, reaches presentation in dreams\nwith the help of repressed erotic desires.\nTowards the explanation of this statement, which is no theoretical\npostulate, it must be remembered that no other class of instincts has\nrequired so vast a suppression at the behest of civilization as the\nsexual, whilst their mastery by the highest psychical processes are in\nmost persons soonest of all relinquished. Since we have learnt to\nunderstand _infantile sexuality_, often so vague in its expression, so\ninvariably overlooked and misunderstood, we are justified in saying that\nnearly every civilized person has retained at some point or other the\ninfantile type of sex life; thus we understand that repressed infantile\nsex desires furnish the most frequent and most powerful impulses for the\nformation of dreams.[1]\nIf the dream, which is the expression of some erotic desire, succeeds in\nmaking its manifest content appear innocently asexual, it is only\npossible in one way. The matter of these sexual presentations cannot be\nexhibited as such, but must be replaced by allusions, suggestions, and\nsimilar indirect means; differing from other cases of indirect\npresentation, those used in dreams must be deprived of direct\nunderstanding. The means of presentation which answer these requirements\nare commonly termed \"symbols.\" A special interest has been directed\ntowards these, since it has been observed that the dreamers of the same\nlanguage use the like symbols--indeed, that in certain cases community\nof symbol is greater than community of speech. Since the dreamers do not\nthemselves know the meaning of the symbols they use, it remains a puzzle\nwhence arises their relationship with what they replace and denote. The\nfact itself is undoubted, and becomes of importance for the technique of\nthe interpretation of dreams, since by the aid of a knowledge of this\nsymbolism it is possible to understand the meaning of the elements of a\ndream, or parts of a dream, occasionally even the whole dream itself,\nwithout having to question the dreamer as to his own ideas. We thus come\nnear to the popular idea of an interpretation of dreams, and, on the\nother hand, possess again the technique of the ancients, among whom the\ninterpretation of dreams was identical with their explanation through\nsymbolism.\nThough the study of dream symbolism is far removed from finality, we now\npossess a series of general statements and of particular observations\nwhich are quite certain. There are symbols which practically always have\nthe same meaning: Emperor and Empress (King and Queen) always mean the\nparents; room, a woman[2], and so on. The sexes are represented by a\ngreat variety of symbols, many of which would be at first quite\nincomprehensible had not the clews to the meaning been often obtained\nthrough other channels.\nThere are symbols of universal circulation, found in all dreamers, of\none range of speech and culture; there are others of the narrowest\nindividual significance which an individual has built up out of his own\nmaterial. In the first class those can be differentiated whose claim can\nbe at once recognized by the replacement of sexual things in common\nspeech (those, for instance, arising from agriculture, as reproduction,\nseed) from others whose sexual references appear to reach back to the\nearliest times and to the obscurest depths of our image-building. The\npower of building symbols in both these special forms of symbols has not\ndied out. Recently discovered things, like the airship, are at once\nbrought into universal use as sex symbols.\nIt would be quite an error to suppose that a profounder knowledge of\ndream symbolism (the \"Language of Dreams\") would make us independent of\nquestioning the dreamer regarding his impressions about the dream, and\nwould give us back the whole technique of ancient dream interpreters.\nApart from individual symbols and the variations in the use of what is\ngeneral, one never knows whether an element in the dream is to be\nunderstood symbolically or in its proper meaning; the whole content of\nthe dream is certainly not to be interpreted symbolically. The knowledge\nof dream symbols will only help us in understanding portions of the\ndream content, and does not render the use of the technical rules\npreviously given at all superfluous. But it must be of the greatest\nservice in interpreting a dream just when the impressions of the dreamer\nare withheld or are insufficient.\nDream symbolism proves also indispensable for understanding the\nso-called \"typical\" dreams and the dreams that \"repeat themselves.\"\nDream symbolism leads us far beyond the dream; it does not belong only\nto dreams, but is likewise dominant in legend, myth, and saga, in wit\nand in folklore. It compels us to pursue the inner meaning of the dream\nin these productions. But we must acknowledge that symbolism is not a\nresult of the dream work, but is a peculiarity probably of our\nunconscious thinking, which furnishes to the dream work the matter for\ncondensation, displacement, and dramatization.\n[1] Freud, \"Three Contributions to Sexual Theory,\" translated by A.A.\nBrill (_Journal of Nervous and Mental Disease_ Publishing Company, New\nYork).\n[2] The words from \"and\" to \"channels\" in the next sentence is a short\nsummary of the passage in the original. As this book will be read by\nother than professional people the passage has not been translated, in\ndeference to English opinion.--TRANSLATOR.\nIV\nDREAM ANALYSIS\nPerhaps we shall now begin to suspect that dream interpretation is\ncapable of giving us hints about the structure of our psychic apparatus\nwhich we have thus far expected in vain from philosophy. We shall not,\nhowever, follow this track, but return to our original problem as soon\nas we have cleared up the subject of dream-disfigurement. The question\nhas arisen how dreams with disagreeable content can be analyzed as the\nfulfillment of wishes. We see now that this is possible in case\ndream-disfigurement has taken place, in case the disagreeable content\nserves only as a disguise for what is wished. Keeping in mind our\nassumptions in regard to the two psychic instances, we may now proceed\nto say: disagreeable dreams, as a matter of fact, contain something\nwhich is disagreeable to the second instance, but which at the same time\nfulfills a wish of the first instance. They are wish dreams in the sense\nthat every dream originates in the first instance, while the second\ninstance acts towards the dream only in repelling, not in a creative\nmanner. If we limit ourselves to a consideration of what the second\ninstance contributes to the dream, we can never understand the dream. If\nwe do so, all the riddles which the authors have found in the dream\nremain unsolved.\nThat the dream actually has a secret meaning, which turns out to be the\nfulfillment of a wish, must be proved afresh for every case by means of\nan analysis. I therefore select several dreams which have painful\ncontents and attempt an analysis of them. They are partly dreams of\nhysterical subjects, which require long preliminary statements, and now\nand then also an examination of the psychic processes which occur in\nhysteria. I cannot, however, avoid this added difficulty in the\nexposition.\nWhen I give a psychoneurotic patient analytical treatment, dreams are\nalways, as I have said, the subject of our discussion. It must,\ntherefore, give him all the psychological explanations through whose aid\nI myself have come to an understanding of his symptoms, and here I\nundergo an unsparing criticism, which is perhaps not less keen than that\nI must expect from my colleagues. Contradiction of the thesis that all\ndreams are the fulfillments of wishes is raised by my patients with\nperfect regularity. Here are several examples of the dream material\nwhich is offered me to refute this position.\n\"You always tell me that the dream is a wish fulfilled,\" begins a clever\nlady patient. \"Now I shall tell you a dream in which the content is\nquite the opposite, in which a wish of mine is _not_ fulfilled. How do\nyou reconcile that with your theory? The dream is as follows:--\n_\"I want to give a supper, but having nothing at hand except some smoked\nsalmon, I think of going marketing, but I remember that it is Sunday\nafternoon, when all the shops are closed. I next try to telephone to\nsome caterers, but the telephone is out of order.... Thus I must resign\nmy wish to give a supper.\"_\nI answer, of course, that only the analysis can decide the meaning of\nthis dream, although I admit that at first sight it seems sensible and\ncoherent, and looks like the opposite of a wish-fulfillment. \"But what\noccurrence has given rise to this dream?\" I ask. \"You know that the\nstimulus for a dream always lies among the experiences of the preceding\nday.\"\n_Analysis._--The husband of the patient, an upright and conscientious\nwholesale butcher, had told her the day before that he is growing too\nfat, and that he must, therefore, begin treatment for obesity. He was\ngoing to get up early, take exercise, keep to a strict diet, and above\nall accept no more invitations to suppers. She proceeds laughingly to\nrelate how her husband at an inn table had made the acquaintance of an\nartist, who insisted upon painting his portrait because he, the painter,\nhad never found such an expressive head. But her husband had answered in\nhis rough way, that he was very thankful for the honor, but that he was\nquite convinced that a portion of the backside of a pretty young girl\nwould please the artist better than his whole face[1]. She said that she\nwas at the time very much in love with her husband, and teased him a\ngood deal. She had also asked him not to send her any caviare. What does\nthat mean?\nAs a matter of fact, she had wanted for a long time to eat a caviare\nsandwich every forenoon, but had grudged herself the expense. Of course,\nshe would at once get the caviare from her husband, as soon as she asked\nhim for it. But she had begged him, on the contrary, not to send her the\ncaviare, in order that she might tease him about it longer.\nThis explanation seems far-fetched to me. Unadmitted motives are in the\nhabit of hiding behind such unsatisfactory explanations. We are reminded\nof subjects hypnotized by Bernheim, who carried out a posthypnotic\norder, and who, upon being asked for their motives, instead of\nanswering: \"I do not know why I did that,\" had to invent a reason that\nwas obviously inadequate. Something similar is probably the case with\nthe caviare of my patient. I see that she is compelled to create an\nunfulfilled wish in life. Her dream also shows the reproduction of the\nwish as accomplished. But why does she need an unfulfilled wish?\nThe ideas so far produced are insufficient for the interpretation of the\ndream. I beg for more. After a short pause, which corresponds to the\novercoming of a resistance, she reports further that the day before she\nhad made a visit to a friend, of whom she is really jealous, because her\nhusband is always praising this woman so much. Fortunately, this friend\nis very lean and thin, and her husband likes well-rounded figures. Now\nof what did this lean friend speak? Naturally of her wish to become\nsomewhat stouter. She also asked my patient: \"When are you going to\ninvite us again? You always have such a good table.\"\nNow the meaning of the dream is clear. I may say to the patient: \"It is\njust as though you had thought at the time of the request: 'Of course,\nI'll invite you, so you can eat yourself fat at my house and become\nstill more pleasing to my husband. I would rather give no more suppers.'\nThe dream then tells you that you cannot give a supper, thereby\nfulfilling your wish not to contribute anything to the rounding out of\nyour friend's figure. The resolution of your husband to refuse\ninvitations to supper for the sake of getting thin teaches you that one\ngrows fat on the things served in company.\" Now only some conversation\nis necessary to confirm the solution. The smoked salmon in the dream has\nnot yet been traced. \"How did the salmon mentioned in the dream occur to\nyou?\" \"Smoked salmon is the favorite dish of this friend,\" she answered.\nI happen to know the lady, and may corroborate this by saying that she\ngrudges herself the salmon just as much as my patient grudges herself\nthe caviare.\nThe dream admits of still another and more exact interpretation, which\nis necessitated only by a subordinate circumstance. The two\ninterpretations do not contradict one another, but rather cover each\nother and furnish a neat example of the usual ambiguity of dreams as\nwell as of all other psychopathological formations. We have seen that at\nthe same time that she dreams of the denial of the wish, the patient is\nin reality occupied in securing an unfulfilled wish (the caviare\nsandwiches). Her friend, too, had expressed a wish, namely, to get\nfatter, and it would not surprise us if our lady had dreamt that the\nwish of the friend was not being fulfilled. For it is her own wish that\na wish of her friend's--for increase in weight--should not be fulfilled.\nInstead of this, however, she dreams that one of her own wishes is not\nfulfilled. The dream becomes capable of a new interpretation, if in the\ndream she does not intend herself, but her friend, if she has put\nherself in the place of her friend, or, as we may say, has identified\nherself with her friend.\nI think she has actually done this, and as a sign of this identification\nshe has created an unfulfilled wish in reality. But what is the meaning\nof this hysterical identification? To clear this up a thorough\nexposition is necessary. Identification is a highly important factor in\nthe mechanism of hysterical symptoms; by this means patients are enabled\nin their symptoms to represent not merely their own experiences, but the\nexperiences of a great number of other persons, and can suffer, as it\nwere, for a whole mass of people, and fill all the parts of a drama by\nmeans of their own personalities alone. It will here be objected that\nthis is well-known hysterical imitation, the ability of hysteric\nsubjects to copy all the symptoms which impress them when they occur in\nothers, as though their pity were stimulated to the point of\nreproduction. But this only indicates the way in which the psychic\nprocess is discharged in hysterical imitation; the way in which a\npsychic act proceeds and the act itself are two different things. The\nlatter is slightly more complicated than one is apt to imagine the\nimitation of hysterical subjects to be: it corresponds to an unconscious\nconcluded process, as an example will show. The physician who has a\nfemale patient with a particular kind of twitching, lodged in the\ncompany of other patients in the same room of the hospital, is not\nsurprised when some morning he learns that this peculiar hysterical\nattack has found imitations. He simply says to himself: The others have\nseen her and have done likewise: that is psychic infection. Yes, but\npsychic infection proceeds in somewhat the following manner: As a rule,\npatients know more about one another than the physician knows about each\nof them, and they are concerned about each other when the visit of the\ndoctor is over. Some of them have an attack to-day: soon it is known\namong the rest that a letter from home, a return of lovesickness or the\nlike, is the cause of it. Their sympathy is aroused, and the following\nsyllogism, which does not reach consciousness, is completed in them: \"If\nit is possible to have this kind of an attack from such causes, I too\nmay have this kind of an attack, for I have the same reasons.\" If this\nwere a cycle capable of becoming conscious, it would perhaps express\nitself in _fear_ of getting the same attack; but it takes place in\nanother psychic sphere, and, therefore, ends in the realization of the\ndreaded symptom. Identification is therefore not a simple imitation, but\na sympathy based upon the same etiological claim; it expresses an \"as\nthough,\" and refers to some common quality which has remained in the\nunconscious.\nIdentification is most often used in hysteria to express sexual\ncommunity. An hysterical woman identifies herself most readily--although\nnot exclusively--with persons with whom she has had sexual relations, or\nwho have sexual intercourse with the same persons as herself. Language\ntakes such a conception into consideration: two lovers are \"one.\" In the\nhysterical phantasy, as well as in the dream, it is sufficient for the\nidentification if one thinks of sexual relations, whether or not they\nbecome real. The patient, then, only follows the rules of the hysterical\nthought processes when she gives expression to her jealousy of her\nfriend (which, moreover, she herself admits to be unjustified, in that\nshe puts herself in her place and identifies herself with her by\ncreating a symptom--the denied wish). I might further clarify the\nprocess specifically as follows: She puts herself in the place of her\nfriend in the dream, because her friend has taken her own place relation\nto her husband, and because she would like to take her friend's place in\nthe esteem of her husband[2].\nThe contradiction to my theory of dreams in the case of another female\npatient, the most witty among all my dreamers, was solved in a simpler\nmanner, although according to the scheme that the non-fulfillment of one\nwish signifies the fulfillment of another. I had one day explained to\nher that the dream is a wish of fulfillment. The next day she brought me\na dream to the effect that she was traveling with her mother-in-law to\ntheir common summer resort. Now I knew that she had struggled violently\nagainst spending the summer in the neighborhood of her mother-in-law. I\nalso knew that she had luckily avoided her mother-in-law by renting an\nestate in a far-distant country resort. Now the dream reversed this\nwished-for solution; was not this in the flattest contradiction to my\ntheory of wish-fulfillment in the dream? Certainly, it was only\nnecessary to draw the inferences from this dream in order to get at its\ninterpretation. According to this dream, I was in the wrong. _It was\nthus her wish that I should be in the wrong, and this wish the dream\nshowed her as fulfilled._ But the wish that I should be in the wrong,\nwhich was fulfilled in the theme of the country home, referred to a more\nserious matter. At that time I had made up my mind, from the material\nfurnished by her analysis, that something of significance for her\nillness must have occurred at a certain time in her life. She had denied\nit because it was not present in her memory. We soon came to see that I\nwas in the right. Her wish that I should be in the wrong, which is\ntransformed into the dream, thus corresponded to the justifiable wish\nthat those things, which at the time had only been suspected, had never\noccurred at all.\nWithout an analysis, and merely by means of an assumption, I took the\nliberty of interpreting a little occurrence in the case of a friend, who\nhad been my colleague through the eight classes of the Gymnasium. He\nonce heard a lecture of mine delivered to a small assemblage, on the\nnovel subject of the dream as the fulfillment of a wish. He went home,\ndreamt _that he had lost all his suits_--he was a lawyer--and then\ncomplained to me about it. I took refuge in the evasion: \"One can't win\nall one's suits,\" but I thought to myself: \"If for eight years I sat as\nPrimus on the first bench, while he moved around somewhere in the middle\nof the class, may he not naturally have had a wish from his boyhood days\nthat I, too, might for once completely disgrace myself?\"\nIn the same way another dream of a more gloomy character was offered me\nby a female patient as a contradiction to my theory of the wish-dream.\nThe patient, a young girl, began as follows: \"You remember that my\nsister has now only one boy, Charles: she lost the elder one, Otto,\nwhile I was still at her house. Otto was my favorite; it was I who\nreally brought him up. I like the other little fellow, too, but of\ncourse not nearly as much as the dead one. Now I dreamt last night that\n_I saw Charles lying dead before me. He was lying in his little coffin,\nhis hands folded: there were candles all about, and, in short, it was\njust like the time of little Otto's death, which shocked me so\nprofoundly_. Now tell me, what does this mean? You know me: am I really\nbad enough to wish my sister to lose the only child she has left? Or\ndoes the dream mean that I wish Charles to be dead rather than Otto,\nwhom I like so much better?\"\nI assured her that this interpretation was impossible. After some\nreflection I was able to give her the interpretation of the dream, which\nI subsequently made her confirm.\nHaving become an orphan at an early age, the girl had been brought up in\nthe house of a much older sister, and had met among the friends and\nvisitors who came to the house, a man who made a lasting impression upon\nher heart. It looked for a time as though these barely expressed\nrelations were to end in marriage, but this happy culmination was\nfrustrated by the sister, whose motives have never found a complete\nexplanation. After the break, the man who was loved by our patient\navoided the house: she herself became independent some time after little\nOtto's death, to whom her affection had now turned. But she did not\nsucceed in freeing herself from the inclination for her sister's friend\nin which she had become involved. Her pride commanded her to avoid him;\nbut it was impossible for her to transfer her love to the other suitors\nwho presented themselves in order. Whenever the man whom she loved, who\nwas a member of the literary profession, announced a lecture anywhere,\nshe was sure to be found in the audience; she also seized every other\nopportunity to see him from a distance unobserved by him. I remembered\nthat on the day before she had told me that the Professor was going to a\ncertain concert, and that she was also going there, in order to enjoy\nthe sight of him. This was on the day of the dream; and the concert was\nto take place on the day on which she told me the dream. I could now\neasily see the correct interpretation, and I asked her whether she could\nthink of any event which had happened after the death of little Otto.\nShe answered immediately: \"Certainly; at that time the Professor\nreturned after a long absence, and I saw him once more beside the coffin\nof little Otto.\" It was exactly as I had expected. I interpreted the\ndream in the following manner: \"If now the other boy were to die, the\nsame thing would be repeated. You would spend the day with your sister,\nthe Professor would surely come in order to offer condolence, and you\nwould see him again under the same circumstances as at that time. The\ndream signifies nothing but this wish of yours to see him again, against\nwhich you are fighting inwardly. I know that you are carrying the ticket\nfor to-day's concert in your bag. Your dream is a dream of impatience;\nit has anticipated the meeting which is to take place to-day by several\nhours.\"\nIn order to disguise her wish she had obviously selected a situation in\nwhich wishes of that sort are commonly suppressed--a situation which is\nso filled with sorrow that love is not thought of. And yet, it is very\neasily probable that even in the actual situation at the bier of the\nsecond, more dearly loved boy, which the dream copied faithfully, she\nhad not been able to suppress her feelings of affection for the visitor\nwhom she had missed for so long a time.\nA different explanation was found in the case of a similar dream of\nanother female patient, who was distinguished in her earlier years by\nher quick wit and her cheerful demeanors and who still showed these\nqualities at least in the notion, which occurred to her in the course of\ntreatment. In connection with a longer dream, it seemed to this lady\nthat she saw her fifteen-year-old daughter lying dead before her in a\nbox. She was strongly inclined to convert this dream-image into an\nobjection to the theory of wish-fulfillment, but herself suspected that\nthe detail of the box must lead to a different conception of the\ndream.[3] In the course of the analysis it occurred to her that on the\nevening before, the conversation of the company had turned upon the\nEnglish word \"box,\" and upon the numerous translations of it into\nGerman, such as box, theater box, chest, box on the ear, &c. From other\ncomponents of the same dream it is now possible to add that the lady had\nguessed the relationship between the English word \"box\" and the German\n_B\u00fcchse_, and had then been haunted by the memory that _B\u00fcchse_ (as well\nas \"box\") is used in vulgar speech to designate the female genital\norgan. It was therefore possible, making a certain allowance for her\nnotions on the subject of topographical anatomy, to assume that the\nchild in the box signified a child in the womb of the mother. At this\nstage of the explanation she no longer denied that the picture of the\ndream really corresponded to one of her wishes. Like so many other young\nwomen, she was by no means happy when she became pregnant, and admitted\nto me more than once the wish that her child might die before its birth;\nin a fit of anger following a violent scene with her husband she had\neven struck her abdomen with her fists in order to hit the child within.\nThe dead child was, therefore, really the fulfillment of a wish, but a\nwish which had been put aside for fifteen years, and it is not\nsurprising that the fulfillment of the wish was no longer recognized\nafter so long an interval. For there had been many changes meanwhile.\nThe group of dreams to which the two last mentioned belong, having as\ncontent the death of beloved relatives, will be considered again under\nthe head of \"Typical Dreams.\" I shall there be able to show by new\nexamples that in spite of their undesirable content, all these dreams\nmust be interpreted as wish-fulfillments. For the following dream, which\nagain was told me in order to deter me from a hasty generalization of\nthe theory of wishing in dreams, I am indebted, not to a patient, but to\nan intelligent jurist of my acquaintance. \"_I dream_,\" my informant\ntells me, \"_that I am walking in front of my house with a lady on my\narm. Here a closed wagon is waiting, a gentleman steps up to me, gives\nhis authority as an agent of the police, and demands that I should\nfollow him. I only ask for time in which to arrange my affairs._ Can you\npossibly suppose this is a wish of mine to be arrested?\" \"Of course\nnot,\" I must admit. \"Do you happen to know upon what charge you were\narrested?\" \"Yes; I believe for infanticide.\" \"Infanticide? But you know\nthat only a mother can commit this crime upon her newly born child?\"\n\"That is true.\"[4] \"And under what circumstances did you dream; what\nhappened on the evening before?\" \"I would rather not tell you that; it\nis a delicate matter.\" \"But I must have it, otherwise we must forgo the\ninterpretation of the dream.\" \"Well, then, I will tell you. I spent the\nnight, not at home, but at the house of a lady who means very much to\nme. When we awoke in the morning, something again passed between us.\nThen I went to sleep again, and dreamt what I have told you.\" \"The woman\nis married?\" \"Yes.\" \"And you do not wish her to conceive a child?\" \"No;\nthat might betray us.\" \"Then you do not practice normal coitus?\" \"I take\nthe precaution to withdraw before ejaculation.\" \"Am I permitted to\nassume that you did this trick several times during the night, and that\nin the morning you were not quite sure whether you had succeeded?\" \"That\nmight be the case.\" \"Then your dream is the fulfillment of a wish. By\nmeans of it you secure the assurance that you have not begotten a child,\nor, what amounts to the same thing, that you have killed a child. I can\neasily demonstrate the connecting links. Do you remember, a few days ago\nwe were talking about the distress of matrimony (Ehenot), and about the\ninconsistency of permitting the practice of coitus as long as no\nimpregnation takes place, while every delinquency after the ovum and\nthe semen meet and a foetus is formed is punished as a crime? In\nconnection with this, we also recalled the medi\u00e6val controversy about\nthe moment of time at which the soul is really lodged in the foetus,\nsince the concept of murder becomes admissible only from that point on.\nDoubtless you also know the gruesome poem by Lenau, which puts\ninfanticide and the prevention of children on the same plane.\"\n\"Strangely enough, I had happened to think of Lenau during the\nafternoon.\" \"Another echo of your dream. And now I shall demonstrate to\nyou another subordinate wish-fulfillment in your dream. You walk in\nfront of your house with the lady on your arm. So you take her home,\ninstead of spending the night at her house, as you do in actuality. The\nfact that the wish-fulfillment, which is the essence of the dream,\ndisguises itself in such an unpleasant form, has perhaps more than one\nreason. From my essay on the etiology of anxiety neuroses, you will see\nthat I note interrupted coitus as one of the factors which cause the\ndevelopment of neurotic fear. It would be consistent with this that if\nafter repeated cohabitation of the kind mentioned you should be left in\nan uncomfortable mood, which now becomes an element in the composition\nof your dream. You also make use of this unpleasant state of mind to\nconceal the wish-fulfillment. Furthermore, the mention of infanticide\nhas not yet been explained. Why does this crime, which is peculiar to\nfemales, occur to you?\" \"I shall confess to you that I was involved in\nsuch an affair years ago. Through my fault a girl tried to protect\nherself from the consequences of a _liaison_ with me by securing an\nabortion. I had nothing to do with carrying out the plan, but I was\nnaturally for a long time worried lest the affair might be discovered.\"\n\"I understand; this recollection furnished a second reason why the\nsupposition that you had done your trick badly must have been painful to\nyou.\"\nA young physician, who had heard this dream of my colleague when it was\ntold, must have felt implicated by it, for he hastened to imitate it in\na dream of his own, applying its mode of thinking to another subject.\nThe day before he had handed in a declaration of his income, which was\nperfectly honest, because he had little to declare. He dreamt that an\nacquaintance of his came from a meeting of the tax commission and\ninformed him that all the other declarations of income had passed\nuncontested, but that his own had awakened general suspicion, and that\nhe would be punished with a heavy fine. The dream is a poorly-concealed\nfulfillment of the wish to be known as a physician with a large income.\nIt likewise recalls the story of the young girl who was advised against\naccepting her suitor because he was a man of quick temper who would\nsurely treat her to blows after they were married.\nThe answer of the girl was: \"I wish he _would_ strike me!\" Her wish to\nbe married is so strong that she takes into the bargain the discomfort\nwhich is said to be connected with matrimony, and which is predicted for\nher, and even raises it to a wish.\nIf I group the very frequently occurring dreams of this sort, which seem\nflatly to contradict my theory, in that they contain the denial of a\nwish or some occurrence decidedly unwished for, under the head of\n\"counter wish-dreams,\" I observe that they may all be referred to two\nprinciples, of which one has not yet been mentioned, although it plays a\nlarge part in the dreams of human beings. One of the motives inspiring\nthese dreams is the wish that I should appear in the wrong. These dreams\nregularly occur in the course of my treatment if the patient shows a\nresistance against me, and I can count with a large degree of certainty\nupon causing such a dream after I have once explained to the patient my\ntheory that the dream is a wish-fulfillment.[5] I may even expect this\nto be the case in a dream merely in order to fulfill the wish that I may\nappear in the wrong. The last dream which I shall tell from those\noccurring in the course of treatment again shows this very thing. A\nyoung girl who has struggled hard to continue my treatment, against the\nwill of her relatives and the authorities whom she had consulted, dreams\nas follows: _She is forbidden at home to come to me any more. She then\nreminds me of the promise I made her to treat her for nothing if\nnecessary, and I say to her: \"I can show no consideration in money\nmatters.\"_\nIt is not at all easy in this case to demonstrate the fulfillment of a\nwish, but in all cases of this kind there is a second problem, the\nsolution of which helps also to solve the first. Where does she get the\nwords which she puts into my mouth? Of course I have never told her\nanything like that, but one of her brothers, the very one who has the\ngreatest influence over her, has been kind enough to make this remark\nabout me. It is then the purpose of the dream that this brother should\nremain in the right; and she does not try to justify this brother merely\nin the dream; it is her purpose in life and the motive for her being\nill.\nThe other motive for counter wish-dreams is so clear that there is\ndanger of overlooking it, as for some time happened in my own case. In\nthe sexual make-up of many people there is a masochistic component,\nwhich has arisen through the conversion of the aggressive, sadistic\ncomponent into its opposite. Such people are called \"ideal\" masochists,\nif they seek pleasure not in the bodily pain which may be inflicted upon\nthem, but in humiliation and in chastisement of the soul. It is obvious\nthat such persons can have counter wish-dreams and disagreeable dreams,\nwhich, however, for them are nothing but wish-fulfillment, affording\nsatisfaction for their masochistic inclinations. Here is such a dream. A\nyoung man, who has in earlier years tormented his elder brother, towards\nwhom he was homosexually inclined, but who had undergone a complete\nchange of character, has the following dream, which consists of three\nparts: (1) _He is \"insulted\" by his brother._ (2) _Two adults are\ncaressing each other with homosexual intentions._ (3) _His brother has\nsold the enterprise whose management the young man reserved for his own\nfuture._ He awakens from the last-mentioned dream with the most\nunpleasant feelings, and yet it is a masochistic wish-dream, which might\nbe translated: It would serve me quite right if my brother were to make\nthat sale against my interest, as a punishment for all the torments\nwhich he has suffered at my hands.\nI hope that the above discussion and examples will suffice--until\nfurther objection can be raised--to make it seem credible that even\ndreams with a painful content are to be analyzed as the fulfillments of\nwishes. Nor will it seem a matter of chance that in the course of\ninterpretation one always happens upon subjects of which one does not\nlike to speak or think. The disagreeable sensation which such dreams\narouse is simply identical with the antipathy which endeavors--usually\nwith success--to restrain us from the treatment or discussion of such\nsubjects, and which must be overcome by all of us, if, in spite of its\nunpleasantness, we find it necessary to take the matter in hand. But\nthis disagreeable sensation, which occurs also in dreams, does not\npreclude the existence of a wish; every one has wishes which he would\nnot like to tell to others, which he does not want to admit even to\nhimself. We are, on other grounds, justified in connecting the\ndisagreeable character of all these dreams with the fact of dream\ndisfigurement, and in concluding that these dreams are distorted, and\nthat the wish-fulfillment in them is disguised until recognition is\nimpossible for no other reason than that a repugnance, a will to\nsuppress, exists in relation to the subject-matter of the dream or in\nrelation to the wish which the dream creates. Dream disfigurement,\nthen, turns out in reality to be an act of the censor. We shall take\ninto consideration everything which the analysis of disagreeable dreams\nhas brought to light if we reword our formula as follows: _The dream is\nthe (disguised) fulfillment of a (suppressed, repressed) wish_.\nNow there still remain as a particular species of dreams with painful\ncontent, dreams of anxiety, the inclusion of which under dreams of\nwishing will find least acceptance with the uninitiated. But I can\nsettle the problem of anxiety dreams in very short order; for what they\nmay reveal is not a new aspect of the dream problem; it is a question in\ntheir case of understanding neurotic anxiety in general. The fear which\nwe experience in the dream is only seemingly explained by the dream\ncontent. If we subject the content of the dream to analysis, we become\naware that the dream fear is no more justified by the dream content than\nthe fear in a phobia is justified by the idea upon which the phobia\ndepends. For example, it is true that it is possible to fall out of a\nwindow, and that some care must be exercised when one is near a window,\nbut it is inexplicable why the anxiety in the corresponding phobia is so\ngreat, and why it follows its victims to an extent so much greater than\nis warranted by its origin. The same explanation, then, which applies to\nthe phobia applies also to the dream of anxiety. In both cases the\nanxiety is only superficially attached to the idea which accompanies it\nand comes from another source.\nOn account of the intimate relation of dream fear to neurotic fear,\ndiscussion of the former obliges me to refer to the latter. In a little\nessay on \"The Anxiety Neurosis,\"[6] I maintained that neurotic fear has\nits origin in the sexual life, and corresponds to a libido which has\nbeen turned away from its object and has not succeeded in being applied.\nFrom this formula, which has since proved its validity more and more\nclearly, we may deduce the conclusion that the content of anxiety dreams\nis of a sexual nature, the libido belonging to which content has been\ntransformed into fear.\n[1] To sit for the painter. Goethe: \"And if he has no backside, how can\nthe nobleman sit?\"\n[2] I myself regret the introduction of such passages from the\npsychopathology of hysteria, which, because of their fragmentary\nrepresentation and of being torn from all connection with the subject,\ncannot have a very enlightening influence. If these passages are capable\nof throwing light upon the intimate relations between the dream and the\npsychoneuroses, they have served the purpose for which I have taken them\nup.\n[3] Something like the smoked salmon in the dream of the deferred\nsupper.\n[4] It often happens that a dream is told incompletely, and that a\nrecollection of the omitted portions appear only in the course of the\nanalysis. These portions subsequently fitted in, regularly furnish the\nkey to the interpretation. _Cf._ below, about forgetting in dreams.\n[5] Similar \"counter wish-dreams\" have been repeatedly reported to me\nwithin the last few years by my pupils who thus reacted to their first\nencounter with the \"wish theory of the dream.\"\n[6] See _Selected Papers on Hysteria and other Psychoneuroses_, p. 133,\ntranslated by A.A. Brill, _Journal of Nervous and Mental Diseases_,\nMonograph Series.\nV\nSEX IN DREAMS\nThe more one is occupied with the solution of dreams, the more willing\none must become to acknowledge that the majority of the dreams of adults\ntreat of sexual material and give expression to erotic wishes. Only one\nwho really analyzes dreams, that is to say, who pushes forward from\ntheir manifest content to the latent dream thoughts, can form an opinion\non this subject--never the person who is satisfied with registering the\nmanifest content (as, for example, N\u00e4cke in his works on sexual dreams).\nLet us recognize at once that this fact is not to be wondered at, but\nthat it is in complete harmony with the fundamental assumptions of dream\nexplanation. No other impulse has had to undergo so much suppression\nfrom the time of childhood as the sex impulse in its numerous\ncomponents, from no other impulse have survived so many and such intense\nunconscious wishes, which now act in the sleeping state in such a manner\nas to produce dreams. In dream interpretation, this significance of\nsexual complexes must never be forgotten, nor must they, of course, be\nexaggerated to the point of being considered exclusive.\nOf many dreams it can be ascertained by a careful interpretation that\nthey are even to be taken bisexually, inasmuch as they result in an\nirrefutable secondary interpretation in which they realize homosexual\nfeelings--that is, feelings that are common to the normal sexual\nactivity of the dreaming person. But that all dreams are to be\ninterpreted bisexually, seems to me to be a generalization as\nindemonstrable as it is improbable, which I should not like to support.\nAbove all I should not know how to dispose of the apparent fact that\nthere are many dreams satisfying other than--in the widest sense--erotic\nneeds, as dreams of hunger, thirst, convenience, &c. Likewise the\nsimilar assertions \"that behind every dream one finds the death\nsentence\" (Stekel), and that every dream shows \"a continuation from the\nfeminine to the masculine line\" (Adler), seem to me to proceed far\nbeyond what is admissible in the interpretation of dreams.\nWe have already asserted elsewhere that dreams which are conspicuously\ninnocent invariably embody coarse erotic wishes, and we might confirm\nthis by means of numerous fresh examples. But many dreams which appear\nindifferent, and which would never be suspected of any particular\nsignificance, can be traced back, after analysis, to unmistakably sexual\nwish-feelings, which are often of an unexpected nature. For example,\nwho would suspect a sexual wish in the following dream until the\ninterpretation had been worked out? The dreamer relates: _Between two\nstately palaces stands a little house, receding somewhat, whose doors\nare closed. My wife leads me a little way along the street up to the\nlittle house, and pushes in the door, and then I slip quickly and easily\ninto the interior of a courtyard that slants obliquely upwards._\nAny one who has had experience in the translating of dreams will, of\ncourse, immediately perceive that penetrating into narrow spaces, and\nopening locked doors, belong to the commonest sexual symbolism, and will\neasily find in this dream a representation of attempted coition from\nbehind (between the two stately buttocks of the female body). The narrow\nslanting passage is of course the vagina; the assistance attributed to\nthe wife of the dreamer requires the interpretation that in reality it\nis only consideration for the wife which is responsible for the\ndetention from such an attempt. Moreover, inquiry shows that on the\nprevious day a young girl had entered the household of the dreamer who\nhad pleased him, and who had given him the impression that she would not\nbe altogether opposed to an approach of this sort. The little house\nbetween the two palaces is taken from a reminiscence of the Hradschin\nin Prague, and thus points again to the girl who is a native of that\ncity.\nIf with my patients I emphasize the frequency of the Oedipus dream--of\nhaving sexual intercourse with one's mother--I get the answer: \"I cannot\nremember such a dream.\" Immediately afterwards, however, there arises\nthe recollection of another disguised and indifferent dream, which has\nbeen dreamed repeatedly by the patient, and the analysis shows it to be\na dream of this same content--that is, another Oedipus dream. I can\nassure the reader that veiled dreams of sexual intercourse with the\nmother are a great deal more frequent than open ones to the same effect.\nThere are dreams about landscapes and localities in which emphasis is\nalways laid upon the assurance: \"I have been there before.\" In this case\nthe locality is always the genital organ of the mother; it can indeed be\nasserted with such certainty of no other locality that one \"has been\nthere before.\"\nA large number of dreams, often full of fear, which are concerned with\npassing through narrow spaces or with staying, in the water, are based\nupon fancies about the embryonic life, about the sojourn in the mother's\nwomb, and about the act of birth. The following is the dream of a young\nman who in his fancy has already while in embryo taken advantage of his\nopportunity to spy upon an act of coition between his parents.\n_\"He is in a deep shaft, in which there is a window, as in the Semmering\nTunnel. At first he sees an empty landscape through this window, and\nthen he composes a picture into it, which is immediately at hand and\nwhich fills out the empty space. The picture represents a field which is\nbeing thoroughly harrowed by an implement, and the delightful air, the\naccompanying idea of hard work, and the bluish-black clods of earth make\na pleasant impression. He then goes on and sees a primary school opened\n... and he is surprised that so much attention is devoted in it to the\nsexual feelings of the child, which makes him think of me.\"_\nHere is a pretty water-dream of a female patient, which was turned to\nextraordinary account in the course of treatment.\n_At her summer resort at the ... Lake, she hurls herself into the dark\nwater at a place where the pale moon is reflected in the water._\nDreams of this sort are parturition dreams; their interpretation is\naccomplished by reversing the fact reported in the manifest dream\ncontent; thus, instead of \"throwing one's self into the water,\" read\n\"coming out of the water,\" that is, \"being born.\" The place from which\none is born is recognized if one thinks of the bad sense of the French\n\"la lune.\" The pale moon thus becomes the white \"bottom\" (Popo), which\nthe child soon recognizes as the place from which it came. Now what can\nbe the meaning of the patient's wishing to be born at her summer resort?\nI asked the dreamer this, and she answered without hesitation: \"Hasn't\nthe treatment made me as though I were born again?\" Thus the dream\nbecomes an invitation to continue the cure at this summer resort, that\nis, to visit her there; perhaps it also contains a very bashful allusion\nto the wish to become a mother herself.[1]\nAnother dream of parturition, with its interpretation, I take from the\nwork of E. Jones. _\"She stood at the seashore watching a small boy, who\nseemed to be hers, wading into the water. This he did till the water\ncovered him, and she could only see his head bobbing up and down near\nthe surface. The scene then changed to the crowded hall of a hotel. Her\nhusband left her, and she 'entered into conversation with' a\nstranger.\"_ The second half of the dream was discovered in the analysis\nto represent a flight from her husband, and the entering into intimate\nrelations with a third person, behind whom was plainly indicated Mr.\nX.'s brother mentioned in a former dream. The first part of the dream\nwas a fairly evident birth phantasy. In dreams as in mythology, the\ndelivery of a child _from_ the uterine waters is commonly presented by\ndistortion as the entry of the child _into_ water; among many others,\nthe births of Adonis, Osiris, Moses, and Bacchus are well-known\nillustrations of this. The bobbing up and down of the head in the water\nat once recalled to the patient the sensation of quickening she had\nexperienced in her only pregnancy. Thinking of the boy going into the\nwater induced a reverie in which she saw herself taking him out of the\nwater, carrying him into the nursery, washing him and dressing him, and\ninstalling him in her household.\nThe second half of the dream, therefore, represents thoughts concerning\nthe elopement, which belonged to the first half of the underlying latent\ncontent; the first half of the dream corresponded with the second half\nof the latent content, the birth phantasy. Besides this inversion in\norder, further inversions took place in each half of the dream. In the\nfirst half the child _entered_ the water, and then his head bobbed; in\nthe underlying dream thoughts first the quickening occurred, and then\nthe child left the water (a double inversion). In the second half her\nhusband left her; in the dream thoughts she left her husband.\nAnother parturition dream is related by Abraham of a young woman looking\nforward to her first confinement. From a place in the floor of the house\na subterranean canal leads directly into the water (parturition path,\namniotic liquor). She lifts up a trap in the floor, and there\nimmediately appears a creature dressed in a brownish fur, which almost\nresembles a seal. This creature changes into the younger brother of the\ndreamer, to whom she has always stood in maternal relationship.\nDreams of \"saving\" are connected with parturition dreams. To save,\nespecially to save from the water, is equivalent to giving birth when\ndreamed by a woman; this sense is, however, modified when the dreamer is\na man.\nRobbers, burglars at night, and ghosts, of which we are afraid before\ngoing to bed, and which occasionally even disturb our sleep, originate\nin one and the same childish reminiscence. They are the nightly visitors\nwho have awakened the child to set it on the chamber so that it may not\nwet the bed, or have lifted the cover in order to see clearly how the\nchild is holding its hands while sleeping. I have been able to induce an\nexact recollection of the nocturnal visitor in the analysis of some of\nthese anxiety dreams. The robbers were always the father, the ghosts\nmore probably corresponded to feminine persons with white night-gowns.\nWhen one has become familiar with the abundant use of symbolism for the\nrepresentation of sexual material in dreams, one naturally raises the\nquestion whether there are not many of these symbols which appear once\nand for all with a firmly established significance like the signs in\nstenography; and one is tempted to compile a new dream-book according to\nthe cipher method. In this connection it may be remarked that this\nsymbolism does not belong peculiarly to the dream, but rather to\nunconscious thinking, particularly that of the masses, and it is to be\nfound in greater perfection in the folklore, in the myths, legends, and\nmanners of speech, in the proverbial sayings, and in the current\nwitticisms of a nation than in its dreams.\nThe dream takes advantage of this symbolism in order to give a disguised\nrepresentation to its latent thoughts. Among the symbols which are used\nin this manner there are of course many which regularly, or almost\nregularly, mean the same thing. Only it is necessary to keep in mind the\ncurious plasticity of psychic material. Now and then a symbol in the\ndream content may have to be interpreted not symbolically, but according\nto its real meaning; at another time the dreamer, owing to a peculiar\nset of recollections, may create for himself the right to use anything\nwhatever as a sexual symbol, though it is not ordinarily used in that\nway. Nor are the most frequently used sexual symbols unambiguous every\ntime.\nAfter these limitations and reservations I may call attention to the\nfollowing: Emperor and Empress (King and Queen) in most cases really\nrepresent the parents of the dreamer; the dreamer himself or herself is\nthe prince or princess. All elongated objects, sticks, tree-trunks, and\numbrellas (on account of the stretching-up which might be compared to an\nerection! all elongated and sharp weapons, knives, daggers, and pikes,\nare intended to represent the male member. A frequent, not very\nintelligible, symbol for the same is a nail-file (on account of the\nrubbing and scraping?). Little cases, boxes, caskets, closets, and\nstoves correspond to the female part. The symbolism of lock and key has\nbeen very gracefully employed by Uhland in his song about the \"Grafen\nEberstein,\" to make a common smutty joke. The dream of walking through a\nrow of rooms is a brothel or harem dream. Staircases, ladders, and\nflights of stairs, or climbing on these, either upwards or downwards,\nare symbolic representations of the sexual act. Smooth walls over which\none is climbing, fa\u00e7ades of houses upon which one is letting oneself\ndown, frequently under great anxiety, correspond to the erect human\nbody, and probably repeat in the dream reminiscences of the upward\nclimbing of little children on their parents or foster parents. \"Smooth\"\nwalls are men. Often in a dream of anxiety one is holding on firmly to\nsome projection from a house. Tables, set tables, and boards are women,\nperhaps on account of the opposition which does away with the bodily\ncontours. Since \"bed and board\" (_mensa et thorus_) constitute marriage,\nthe former are often put for the latter in the dream, and as far as\npracticable the sexual presentation complex is transposed to the eating\ncomplex. Of articles of dress the woman's hat may frequently be\ndefinitely interpreted as the male genital. In dreams of men one often\nfinds the cravat as a symbol for the penis; this indeed is not only\nbecause cravats hang down long, and are characteristic of the man, but\nalso because one can select them at pleasure, a freedom which is\nprohibited by nature in the original of the symbol. Persons who make use\nof this symbol in the dream are very extravagant with cravats, and\npossess regular collections of them. All complicated machines and\napparatus in dream are very probably genitals, in the description of\nwhich dream symbolism shows itself to be as tireless as the activity of\nwit. Likewise many landscapes in dreams, especially with bridges or with\nwooded mountains, can be readily recognized as descriptions of the\ngenitals. Finally where one finds incomprehensible neologisms one may\nthink of combinations made up of components having a sexual\nsignificance. Children also in the dream often signify the genitals, as\nmen and women are in the habit of fondly referring to their genital\norgan as their \"little one.\" As a very recent symbol of the male genital\nmay be mentioned the flying machine, utilization of which is justified\nby its relation to flying as well as occasionally by its form. To play\nwith a little child or to beat a little one is often the dream's\nrepresentation of onanism. A number of other symbols, in part not\nsufficiently verified are given by Stekel, who illustrates them with\nexamples. Right and left, according to him, are to be conceived in the\ndream in an ethical sense. \"The right way always signifies the road to\nrighteousness, the left the one to crime. Thus the left may signify\nhomosexuality, incest, and perversion, while the right signifies\nmarriage, relations with a prostitute, &c. The meaning is always\ndetermined by the individual moral view-point of the dreamer.\" Relatives\nin the dream generally play the r\u00f4le of genitals. Not to be able to\ncatch up with a wagon is interpreted by Stekel as regret not to be able\nto come up to a difference in age. Baggage with which one travels is the\nburden of sin by which one is oppressed. Also numbers, which frequently\noccur in the dream, are assigned by Stekel a fixed symbolical meaning,\nbut these interpretations seem neither sufficiently verified nor of\ngeneral validity, although the interpretation in individual cases can\ngenerally be recognized as probable. In a recently published book by W.\nStekel, _Die Sprache des Traumes_, which I was unable to utilize, there\nis a list of the most common sexual symbols, the object of which is to\nprove that all sexual symbols can be bisexually used. He states: \"Is\nthere a symbol which (if in any way permitted by the phantasy) may not\nbe used simultaneously in the masculine and the feminine sense!\" To be\nsure the clause in parentheses takes away much of the absoluteness of\nthis assertion, for this is not at all permitted by the phantasy. I do\nnot, however, think it superfluous to state that in my experience\nStekel's general statement has to give way to the recognition of a\ngreater manifoldness. Besides those symbols, which are just as frequent\nfor the male as for the female genitals, there are others which\npreponderately, or almost exclusively, designate one of the sexes, and\nthere are still others of which only the male or only the female\nsignification is known. To use long, firm objects and weapons as symbols\nof the female genitals, or hollow objects (chests, pouches, &c.), as\nsymbols of the male genitals, is indeed not allowed by the fancy.\nIt is true that the tendency of the dream and the unconscious fancy to\nutilize the sexual symbol bisexually betrays an archaic trend, for in\nchildhood a difference in the genitals is unknown, and the same genitals\nare attributed to both sexes.\nThese very incomplete suggestions may suffice to stimulate others to\nmake a more careful collection.\nI shall now add a few examples of the application of such symbolisms in\ndreams, which will serve to show how impossible it becomes to interpret\na dream without taking into account the symbolism of dreams, and how\nimperatively it obtrudes itself in many cases.\n1. The hat as a symbol of the man (of the male genital): (a fragment\nfrom the dream of a young woman who suffered from agoraphobia on account\nof a fear of temptation).\n\"I am walking in the street in summer, I wear a straw hat of peculiar\nshape, the middle piece of which is bent upwards and the side pieces of\nwhich hang downwards (the description became here obstructed), and in\nsuch a fashion that one is lower than the other. I am cheerful and in a\nconfidential mood, and as I pass a troop of young officers I think to\nmyself: None of you can have any designs upon me.\"\nAs she could produce no associations to the hat, I said to her: \"The hat\nis really a male genital, with its raised middle piece and the two\ndownward hanging side pieces.\" I intentionally refrained from\ninterpreting those details concerning the unequal downward hanging of\nthe two side pieces, although just such individualities in the\ndeterminations lead the way to the interpretation. I continued by saying\nthat if she only had a man with such a virile genital she would not have\nto fear the officers--that is, she would have nothing to wish from them,\nfor she is mainly kept from going without protection and company by her\nfancies of temptation. This last explanation of her fear I had already\nbeen able to give her repeatedly on the basis of other material.\nIt is quite remarkable how the dreamer behaved after this\ninterpretation. She withdrew her description of the hat, and claimed not\nto have said that the two side pieces were hanging downwards. I was,\nhowever, too sure of what I had heard to allow myself to be misled, and\nI persisted in it. She was quiet for a while, and then found the courage\nto ask why it was that one of her husband's testicles was lower than the\nother, and whether it was the same in all men. With this the peculiar\ndetail of the hat was explained, and the whole interpretation was\naccepted by her. The hat symbol was familiar to me long before the\npatient related this dream. From other but less transparent cases I\nbelieve that the hat may also be taken as a female genital.\n2. The little one as the genital--to be run over as a symbol of sexual\nintercourse (another dream of the same agoraphobic patient).\n\"Her mother sends away her little daughter so that she must go alone.\nShe rides with her mother to the railroad and sees her little one\nwalking directly upon the tracks, so that she cannot avoid being run\nover. She hears the bones crackle. (From this she experiences a feeling\nof discomfort but no real horror.) She then looks out through the car\nwindow to see whether the parts cannot be seen behind. She then\nreproaches her mother for allowing the little one to go out alone.\"\nAnalysis. It is not an easy matter to give here a complete\ninterpretation of the dream. It forms part of a cycle of dreams, and can\nbe fully understood only in connection with the others. For it is not\neasy to get the necessary material sufficiently isolated to prove the\nsymbolism. The patient at first finds that the railroad journey is to be\ninterpreted historically as an allusion to a departure from a sanatorium\nfor nervous diseases, with the superintendent of which she naturally was\nin love. Her mother took her away from this place, and the physician\ncame to the railroad station and handed her a bouquet of flowers on\nleaving; she felt uncomfortable because her mother witnessed this\nhomage. Here the mother, therefore, appears as a disturber of her love\naffairs, which is the r\u00f4le actually played by this strict woman during\nher daughter's girlhood. The next thought referred to the sentence: \"She\nthen looks to see whether the parts can be seen behind.\" In the dream\nfa\u00e7ade one would naturally be compelled to think of the parts of the\nlittle daughter run over and ground up. The thought, however, turns in\nquite a different direction. She recalls that she once saw her father in\nthe bath-room naked from behind; she then begins to talk about the sex\ndifferentiation, and asserts that in the man the genitals can be seen\nfrom behind, but in the woman they cannot. In this connection she now\nherself offers the interpretation that the little one is the genital,\nher little one (she has a four-year-old daughter) her own genital. She\nreproaches her mother for wanting her to live as though she had no\ngenital, and recognizes this reproach in the introductory sentence of\nthe dream; the mother sends away her little one so that she must go\nalone. In her phantasy going alone on the street signifies to have no\nman and no sexual relations (coire = to go together), and this she does\nnot like. According to all her statements she really suffered as a girl\non account of the jealousy of her mother, because she showed a\npreference for her father.\nThe \"little one\" has been noted as a symbol for the male or the female\ngenitals by Stekel, who can refer in this connection to a very\nwidespread usage of language.\nThe deeper interpretation of this dream depends upon another dream of\nthe same night in which the dreamer identifies herself with her brother.\nShe was a \"tomboy,\" and was always being told that she should have been\nborn a boy. This identification with the brother shows with special\nclearness that \"the little one\" signifies the genital. The mother\nthreatened him (her) with castration, which could only be understood as\na punishment for playing with the parts, and the identification,\ntherefore, shows that she herself had masturbated as a child, though\nthis fact she now retained only in memory concerning her brother. An\nearly knowledge of the male genital which she later lost she must have\nacquired at that time according to the assertions of this second dream.\nMoreover the second dream points to the infantile sexual theory that\ngirls originate from boys through castration. After I had told her of\nthis childish belief, she at once confirmed it with an anecdote in which\nthe boy asks the girl: \"Was it cut off?\" to which the girl replied, \"No,\nit's always been so.\"\nThe sending away of the little one, of the genital, in the first dream\ntherefore also refers to the threatened castration. Finally she blames\nher mother for not having been born a boy.\nThat \"being run over\" symbolizes sexual intercourse would not be evident\nfrom this dream if we were not sure of it from many other sources.\n3. Representation of the genital by structures, stairways, and shafts.\n(Dream of a young man inhibited by a father complex.)\n\"He is taking a walk with his father in a place which is surely the\nPrater, for the _Rotunda_ may be seen in front of which there is a small\nfront structure to which is attached a captive balloon; the balloon,\nhowever, seems quite collapsed. His father asks him what this is all\nfor; he is surprised at it, but he explains it to his father. They come\ninto a court in which lies a large sheet of tin. His father wants to\npull off a big piece of this, but first looks around to see if any one\nis watching. He tells his father that all he needs to do is to speak to\nthe watchman, and then he can take without any further difficulty as\nmuch as he wants to. From this court a stairway leads down into a shaft,\nthe walls of which are softly upholstered something like a leather\npocketbook. At the end of this shaft there is a longer platform, and\nthen a new shaft begins....\"\nAnalysis. This dream belongs to a type of patient which is not favorable\nfrom a therapeutic point of view. They follow in the analysis without\noffering any resistances whatever up to a certain point, but from that\npoint on they remain almost inaccessible. This dream he almost analyzed\nhimself. \"The Rotunda,\" he said, \"is my genital, the captive balloon in\nfront is my penis, about the weakness of which I have worried.\" We must,\nhowever, interpret in greater detail; the Rotunda is the buttock which\nis regularly associated by the child with the genital, the smaller front\nstructure is the scrotum. In the dream his father asks him what this is\nall for--that is, he asks him about the purpose and arrangement of the\ngenitals. It is quite evident that this state of affairs should be\nturned around, and that he should be the questioner. As such a\nquestioning on the side of the father has never taken place in reality,\nwe must conceive the dream thought as a wish, or take it conditionally,\nas follows: \"If I had only asked my father for sexual enlightenment.\"\nThe continuation of this thought we shall soon find in another place.\nThe court in which the tin sheet is spread out is not to be conceived\nsymbolically in the first instance, but originates from his father's\nplace of business. For discretionary reasons I have inserted the tin for\nanother material in which the father deals, without, however, changing\nanything in the verbal expression of the dream. The dreamer had entered\nhis father's business, and had taken a terrible dislike to the\nquestionable practices upon which profit mainly depends. Hence the\ncontinuation of the above dream thought (\"if I had only asked him\")\nwould be: \"He would have deceived me just as he does his customers.\" For\nthe pulling off, which serves to represent commercial dishonesty, the\ndreamer himself gives a second explanation--namely, onanism. This is not\nonly entirely familiar to us, but agrees very well with the fact that\nthe secrecy of onanism is expressed by its opposite (\"Why one can do it\nquite openly\"). It, moreover, agrees entirely with our expectations that\nthe onanistic activity is again put off on the father, just as was the\nquestioning in the first scene of the dream. The shaft he at once\ninterprets as the vagina by referring to the soft upholstering of the\nwalls. That the act of coition in the vagina is described as a going\ndown instead of in the usual way as a going up, I have also found true\nin other instances[2].\nThe details that at the end of the first shaft there is a longer\nplatform and then a new shaft, he himself explains biographically. He\nhad for some time consorted with women sexually, but had then given it\nup because of inhibitions and now hopes to be able to take it up again\nwith the aid of the treatment. The dream, however, becomes indistinct\ntoward the end, and to the experienced interpreter it becomes evident\nthat in the second scene of the dream the influence of another subject\nhas begun to assert itself; in this his father's business and his\ndishonest practices signify the first vagina represented as a shaft so\nthat one might think of a reference to the mother.\n4. The male genital symbolized by persons and the female by a landscape.\n(Dream of a woman of the lower class, whose husband is a policeman,\nreported by B. Dattner.)\n... Then some one broke into the house and anxiously called for a\npoliceman. But he went with two tramps by mutual consent into a\nchurch,[3] to which led a great many stairs;[4] behind the church there\nwas a mountain,[5] on top of which a dense forest.[6] The policeman was\nfurnished with a helmet, a gorget, and a cloak.[7] The two vagrants, who\nwent along with the policeman quite peaceably, had tied to their loins\nsack-like aprons.[8] A road led from the church to the mountain. This\nroad was overgrown on each side with grass and brushwood, which became\nthicker and thicker as it reached the height of the mountain, where it\nspread out into quite a forest.\n5. A stairway dream.\n(Reported and interpreted by Otto Rank.)\nFor the following transparent pollution dream, I am indebted to the\nsame colleague who furnished us with the dental-irritation dream.\n\"I am running down the stairway in the stair-house after a little girl,\nwhom I wish to punish because she has done something to me. At the\nbottom of the stairs some one held the child for me. (A grown-up woman?)\nI grasp it, but do not know whether I have hit it, for I suddenly find\nmyself in the middle of the stairway where I practice coitus with the\nchild (in the air as it were). It is really no coitus, I only rub my\ngenital on her external genital, and in doing this I see it very\ndistinctly, as distinctly as I see her head which is lying sideways.\nDuring the sexual act I see hanging to the left and above me (also as if\nin the air) two small pictures, landscapes, representing a house on a\ngreen. On the smaller one my surname stood in the place where the\npainter's signature should be; it seemed to be intended for my birthday\npresent. A small sign hung in front of the pictures to the effect that\ncheaper pictures could also be obtained. I then see myself very\nindistinctly lying in bed, just as I had seen myself at the foot of the\nstairs, and I am awakened by a feeling of dampness which came from the\npollution.\"\nInterpretation. The dreamer had been in a book-store on the evening of\nthe day of the dream, where, while he was waiting, he examined some\npictures which were exhibited, which represented motives similar to the\ndream pictures. He stepped nearer to a small picture which particularly\ntook his fancy in order to see the name of the artist, which, however,\nwas quite unknown to him.\nLater in the same evening, in company, he heard about a Bohemian\nservant-girl who boasted that her illegitimate child \"was made on the\nstairs.\" The dreamer inquired about the details of this unusual\noccurrence, and learned that the servant-girl went with her lover to the\nhome of her parents, where there was no opportunity for sexual\nrelations, and that the excited man performed the act on the stairs. In\nwitty allusion to the mischievous expression used about wine-adulterers,\nthe dreamer remarked, \"The child really grew on the cellar steps.\"\nThese experiences of the day, which are quite prominent in the dream\ncontent, were readily reproduced by the dreamer. But he just as readily\nreproduced an old fragment of infantile recollection which was also\nutilized by the dream. The stair-house was the house in which he had\nspent the greatest part of his childhood, and in which he had first\nbecome acquainted with sexual problems. In this house he used, among\nother things, to slide down the banister astride which caused him to\nbecome sexually excited. In the dream he also comes down the stairs very\nrapidly--so rapidly that, according to his own distinct assertions, he\nhardly touched the individual stairs, but rather \"flew\" or \"slid down,\"\nas we used to say. Upon reference to this infantile experience, the\nbeginning of the dream seems to represent the factor of sexual\nexcitement. In the same house and in the adjacent residence the dreamer\nused to play pugnacious games with the neighboring children, in which he\nsatisfied himself just as he did in the dream.\nIf one recalls from Freud's investigation of sexual symbolism[9] that in\nthe dream stairs or climbing stairs almost regularly symbolizes coitus,\nthe dream becomes clear. Its motive power as well as its effect, as is\nshown by the pollution, is of a purely libidinous nature. Sexual\nexcitement became aroused during the sleeping state (in the dream this\nis represented by the rapid running or sliding down the stairs) and the\nsadistic thread in this is, on the basis of the pugnacious playing,\nindicated in the pursuing and overcoming of the child. The libidinous\nexcitement becomes enhanced and urges to sexual action (represented in\nthe dream by the grasping of the child and the conveyance of it to the\nmiddle of the stairway). Up to this point the dream would be one of\npure, sexual symbolism, and obscure for the unpracticed dream\ninterpreter. But this symbolic gratification, which would have insured\nundisturbed sleep, was not sufficient for the powerful libidinous\nexcitement. The excitement leads to an orgasm, and thus the whole\nstairway symbolism is unmasked as a substitute for coitus. Freud lays\nstress on the rhythmical character of both actions as one of the reasons\nfor the sexual utilization of the stairway symbolism, and this dream\nespecially seems to corroborate this, for, according to the express\nassertion of the dreamer, the rhythm of a sexual act was the most\npronounced feature in the whole dream.\nStill another remark concerning the two pictures, which, aside from\ntheir real significance, also have the value of \"Weibsbilder\" (literally\n_woman-pictures_, but idiomatically _women_). This is at once shown by\nthe fact that the dream deals with a big and a little picture, just as\nthe dream content presents a big (grown up) and a little girl. That\ncheap pictures could also be obtained points to the prostitution\ncomplex, just as the dreamer's surname on the little picture and the\nthought that it was intended for his birthday, point to the parent\ncomplex (to be born on the stairway--to be conceived in coitus).\nThe indistinct final scene, in which the dreamer sees himself on the\nstaircase landing lying in bed and feeling wet, seems to go back into\nchildhood even beyond the infantile onanism, and manifestly has its\nprototype in similarly pleasurable scenes of bed-wetting.\n6. A modified stair-dream.\nTo one of my very nervous patients, who was an abstainer, whose fancy\nwas fixed on his mother, and who repeatedly dreamed of climbing stairs\naccompanied by his mother, I once remarked that moderate masturbation\nwould be less harmful to him than enforced abstinence. This influence\nprovoked the following dream:\n\"His piano teacher reproaches him for neglecting his piano-playing, and\nfor not practicing the _Etudes_ of Moscheles and Clementi's _Gradus ad\nParnassum_.\" In relation to this he remarked that the _Gradus_ is only a\nstairway, and that the piano itself is only a stairway as it has a\nscale.\nIt is correct to say that there is no series of associations which\ncannot be adapted to the representation of sexual facts. I conclude with\nthe dream of a chemist, a young man, who has been trying to give up his\nhabit of masturbation by replacing it with intercourse with women.\n_Preliminary statement._--On the day before the dream he had given a\nstudent instruction concerning Grignard's reaction, in which magnesium\nis to be dissolved in absolutely pure ether under the catalytic\ninfluence of iodine. Two days before, there had been an explosion in the\ncourse of the same reaction, in which the investigator had burned his\nhand.\nDream I. _He is to make phenylmagnesium-bromid; he sees the apparatus\nwith particular clearness, but he has substituted himself for the\nmagnesium. He is now in a curious swaying attitude. He keeps repeating\nto himself, \"This is the right thing, it is working, my feet are\nbeginning to dissolve and my knees are getting soft.\" Then he reaches\ndown and feels for his feet, and meanwhile (he does not know how) he\ntakes his legs out of the crucible, and then again he says to himself,\n\"That cannot be.... Yes, it must be so, it has been done correctly.\"\nThen he partially awakens, and repeats the dream to himself, because he\nwants to tell it to me. He is distinctly afraid of the analysis of the\ndream. He is much excited during this semi-sleeping state, and repeats\ncontinually, \"Phenyl, phenyl.\"_\nII. _He is in ... ing with his whole family; at half-past eleven. He is\nto be at the Schottenthor for a rendezvous with a certain lady, but he\ndoes not wake up until half-past eleven. He says to himself, \"It is too\nlate now; when you get there it will be half-past twelve.\" The next\ninstant he sees the whole family gathered about the table--his mother\nand the servant girl with the soup-tureen with particular clearness.\nThen he says to himself, \"Well, if we are eating already, I certainly\ncan't get away.\"_\nAnalysis: He feels sure that even the first dream contains a reference\nto the lady whom he is to meet at the rendezvous (the dream was dreamed\nduring the night before the expected meeting). The student to whom he\ngave the instruction is a particularly unpleasant fellow; he had said to\nthe chemist: \"That isn't right,\" because the magnesium was still\nunaffected, and the latter answered as though he did not care anything\nabout it: \"It certainly isn't right.\" He himself must be this student;\nhe is as indifferent towards his analysis as the student is towards his\nsynthesis; the _He_ in the dream, however, who accomplishes the\noperation, is myself. How unpleasant he must seem to me with his\nindifference towards the success achieved!\nMoreover, he is the material with which the analysis (synthesis) is\nmade. For it is a question of the success of the treatment. The legs in\nthe dream recall an impression of the previous evening. He met a lady at\na dancing lesson whom he wished to conquer; he pressed her to him so\nclosely that she once cried out. After he had stopped pressing against\nher legs, he felt her firm responding pressure against his lower thighs\nas far as just above his knees, at the place mentioned in the dream. In\nthis situation, then, the woman is the magnesium in the retort, which is\nat last working. He is feminine towards me, as he is masculine towards\nthe woman. If it will work with the woman, the treatment will also work.\nFeeling and becoming aware of himself in the region of his knees refers\nto masturbation, and corresponds to his fatigue of the previous day....\nThe rendezvous had actually been set for half-past eleven. His wish to\noversleep and to remain with his usual sexual objects (that is, with\nmasturbation) corresponds with his resistance.\n[1] It is only of late that I have learned to value the significance of\nfancies and unconscious thoughts about life in the womb. They contain\nthe explanation of the curious fear felt by so many people of being\nburied alive, as well as the profoundest unconscious reason for the\nbelief in a life after death which represents nothing but a projection\ninto the future of this mysterious life before birth. _The act of birth,\nmoreover, is the first experience with fear, and is thus the source and\nmodel of the emotion of fear._\n[2] Cf. _Zentralblatt f\u00fcr psychoanalyse_, I.\n[3] Or chapel--vagina.\n[4] Symbol of coitus.\n[5] Mons veneris.\n[6] Crines pubis.\n[7] Demons in cloaks and capucines are, according to the explanation of\na man versed in the subject, of a phallic nature.\n[8] The two halves of the scrotum.\n[9] See _Zentralblatt f\u00fcr Psychoanalyse_, vol. i., p. 2.\nVI\nTHE WISH IN DREAMS\nThat the dream should be nothing but a wish-fulfillment surely seemed\nstrange to us all--and that not alone because of the contradictions\noffered by the anxiety dream.\nAfter learning from the first analytical explanations that the dream\nconceals sense and psychic validity, we could hardly expect so simple a\ndetermination of this sense. According to the correct but concise\ndefinition of Aristotle, the dream is a continuation of thinking in\nsleep (in so far as one sleeps). Considering that during the day our\nthoughts produce such a diversity of psychic acts--judgments,\nconclusions, contradictions, expectations, intentions, &c.--why should\nour sleeping thoughts be forced to confine themselves to the production\nof wishes? Are there not, on the contrary, many dreams that present a\ndifferent psychic act in dream form, _e.g._, a solicitude, and is not\nthe very transparent father's dream mentioned above of just such a\nnature? From the gleam of light falling into his eyes while asleep the\nfather draws the solicitous conclusion that a candle has been upset and\nmay have set fire to the corpse; he transforms this conclusion into a\ndream by investing it with a senseful situation enacted in the present\ntense. What part is played in this dream by the wish-fulfillment, and\nwhich are we to suspect--the predominance of the thought continued from,\nthe waking state or of the thought incited by the new sensory\nimpression?\nAll these considerations are just, and force us to enter more deeply\ninto the part played by the wish-fulfillment in the dream, and into the\nsignificance of the waking thoughts continued in sleep.\nIt is in fact the wish-fulfillment that has already induced us to\nseparate dreams into two groups. We have found some dreams that were\nplainly wish-fulfillments; and others in which wish-fulfillment could\nnot be recognized, and was frequently concealed by every available\nmeans. In this latter class of dreams we recognized the influence of the\ndream censor. The undisguised wish dreams were chiefly found in\nchildren, yet fleeting open-hearted wish dreams _seemed_ (I purposely\nemphasize this word) to occur also in adults.\nWe may now ask whence the wish fulfilled in the dream originates. But to\nwhat opposition or to what diversity do we refer this \"whence\"? I think\nit is to the opposition between conscious daily life and a psychic\nactivity remaining unconscious which can only make itself noticeable\nduring the night. I thus find a threefold possibility for the origin of\na wish. Firstly, it may have been incited during the day, and owing to\nexternal circumstances failed to find gratification, there is thus left\nfor the night an acknowledged but unfulfilled wish. Secondly, it may\ncome to the surface during the day but be rejected, leaving an\nunfulfilled but suppressed wish. Or, thirdly, it may have no relation to\ndaily life, and belong to those wishes that originate during the night\nfrom the suppression. If we now follow our scheme of the psychic\napparatus, we can localize a wish of the first order in the system\nForec. We may assume that a wish of the second order has been forced\nback from the Forec. system into the Unc. system, where alone, if\nanywhere, it can maintain itself; while a wish-feeling of the third\norder we consider altogether incapable of leaving the Unc. system. This\nbrings up the question whether wishes arising from these different\nsources possess the same value for the dream, and whether they have the\nsame power to incite a dream.\nOn reviewing the dreams which we have at our disposal for answering this\nquestion, we are at once moved to add as a fourth source of the\ndream-wish the actual wish incitements arising during the night, such\nas thirst and sexual desire. It then becomes evident that the source of\nthe dream-wish does not affect its capacity to incite a dream. That a\nwish suppressed during the day asserts itself in the dream can be shown\nby a great many examples. I shall mention a very simple example of this\nclass. A somewhat sarcastic young lady, whose younger friend has become\nengaged to be married, is asked throughout the day by her acquaintances\nwhether she knows and what she thinks of the fianc\u00e9. She answers with\nunqualified praise, thereby silencing her own judgment, as she would\nprefer to tell the truth, namely, that he is an ordinary person. The\nfollowing night she dreams that the same question is put to her, and\nthat she replies with the formula: \"In case of subsequent orders it will\nsuffice to mention the number.\" Finally, we have learned from numerous\nanalyses that the wish in all dreams that have been subject to\ndistortion has been derived from the unconscious, and has been unable to\ncome to perception in the waking state. Thus it would appear that all\nwishes are of the same value and force for the dream formation.\nI am at present unable to prove that the state of affairs is really\ndifferent, but I am strongly inclined to assume a more stringent\ndetermination of the dream-wish. Children's dreams leave no doubt that\nan unfulfilled wish of the day may be the instigator of the dream. But\nwe must not forget that it is, after all, the wish of a child, that it\nis a wish-feeling of infantile strength only. I have a strong doubt\nwhether an unfulfilled wish from the day would suffice to create a dream\nin an adult. It would rather seem that as we learn to control our\nimpulses by intellectual activity, we more and more reject as vain the\nformation or retention of such intense wishes as are natural to\nchildhood. In this, indeed, there may be individual variations; some\nretain the infantile type of psychic processes longer than others. The\ndifferences are here the same as those found in the gradual decline of\nthe originally distinct visual imagination.\nIn general, however, I am of the opinion that unfulfilled wishes of the\nday are insufficient to produce a dream in adults. I readily admit that\nthe wish instigators originating in conscious like contribute towards\nthe incitement of dreams, but that is probably all. The dream would not\noriginate if the foreconscious wish were not reinforced from another\nsource.\nThat source is the unconscious. I believe that _the conscious wish is a\ndream inciter only if it succeeds in arousing a similar unconscious wish\nwhich reinforces it_. Following the suggestions obtained through the\npsychoanalysis of the neuroses, I believe that these unconscious wishes\nare always active and ready for expression whenever they find an\nopportunity to unite themselves with an emotion from conscious life, and\nthat they transfer their greater intensity to the lesser intensity of\nthe latter.[1] It may therefore seem that the conscious wish alone has\nbeen realized in a dream; but a slight peculiarity in the formation of\nthis dream will put us on the track of the powerful helper from the\nunconscious. These ever active and, as it were, immortal wishes from the\nunconscious recall the legendary Titans who from time immemorial have\nborne the ponderous mountains which were once rolled upon them by the\nvictorious gods, and which even now quiver from time to time from the\nconvulsions of their mighty limbs; I say that these wishes found in the\nrepression are of themselves of an infantile origin, as we have learned\nfrom the psychological investigation of the neuroses. I should like,\ntherefore, to withdraw the opinion previously expressed that it is\nunimportant whence the dream-wish originates, and replace it by another,\nas follows: _The wish manifested in the dream must be an infantile one_.\nIn the adult it originates in the Unc., while in the child, where no\nseparation and censor as yet exist between Forec. and Unc., or where\nthese are only in the process of formation, it is an unfulfilled and\nunrepressed wish from the waking state. I am aware that this conception\ncannot be generally demonstrated, but I maintain nevertheless that it\ncan be frequently demonstrated, even when it was not suspected, and that\nit cannot be generally refuted.\nThe wish-feelings which remain from the conscious waking state are,\ntherefore, relegated to the background in the dream formation. In the\ndream content I shall attribute to them only the part attributed to the\nmaterial of actual sensations during sleep. If I now take into account\nthose other psychic instigations remaining from the waking state which\nare not wishes, I shall only adhere to the line mapped out for me by\nthis train of thought. We may succeed in provisionally terminating the\nsum of energy of our waking thoughts by deciding to go to sleep. He is a\ngood sleeper who can do this; Napoleon I. is reputed to have been a\nmodel of this sort. But we do not always succeed in accomplishing it, or\nin accomplishing it perfectly. Unsolved problems, harassing cares,\noverwhelming impressions continue the thinking activity even during\nsleep, maintaining psychic processes in the system which we have termed\nthe foreconscious. These mental processes continuing into sleep may be\ndivided into the following groups: 1, That which has not been terminated\nduring the day owing to casual prevention; 2, that which has been left\nunfinished by temporary paralysis of our mental power, _i.e._ the\nunsolved; 3, that which has been rejected and suppressed during the day.\nThis unites with a powerful group (4) formed by that which has been\nexcited in our Unc. during the day by the work of the foreconscious.\nFinally, we may add group (5) consisting of the indifferent and hence\nunsettled impressions of the day.\nWe should not underrate the psychic intensities introduced into sleep by\nthese remnants of waking life, especially those emanating from the group\nof the unsolved. These excitations surely continue to strive for\nexpression during the night, and we may assume with equal certainty that\nthe sleeping state renders impossible the usual continuation of the\nexcitement in the foreconscious and the termination of the excitement by\nits becoming conscious. As far as we can normally become conscious of\nour mental processes, even during the night, in so far we are not\nasleep. I shall not venture to state what change is produced in the\nForec. system by the sleeping state, but there is no doubt that the\npsychological character of sleep is essentially due to the change of\nenergy in this very system, which also dominates the approach to\nmotility, which is paralyzed during sleep. In contradistinction to this,\nthere seems to be nothing in the psychology of the dream to warrant the\nassumption that sleep produces any but secondary changes in the\nconditions of the Unc. system. Hence, for the nocturnal excitation in\nthe Force, there remains no other path than that followed by the wish\nexcitements from the Unc. This excitation must seek reinforcement from\nthe Unc., and follow the detours of the unconscious excitations. But\nwhat is the relation of the foreconscious day remnants to the dream?\nThere is no doubt that they penetrate abundantly into the dream, that\nthey utilize the dream content to obtrude themselves upon consciousness\neven during the night; indeed, they occasionally even dominate the dream\ncontent, and impel it to continue the work of the day; it is also\ncertain that the day remnants may just as well have any other character\nas that of wishes; but it is highly instructive and even decisive for\nthe theory of wish-fulfillment to see what conditions they must comply\nwith in order to be received into the dream.\nLet us pick out one of the dreams cited above as examples, _e.g._, the\ndream in which my friend Otto seems to show the symptoms of Basedow's\ndisease. My friend Otto's appearance occasioned me some concern during\nthe day, and this worry, like everything else referring to this person,\naffected me. I may also assume that these feelings followed me into\nsleep. I was probably bent on finding out what was the matter with him.\nIn the night my worry found expression in the dream which I have\nreported, the content of which was not only senseless, but failed to\nshow any wish-fulfillment. But I began to investigate for the source of\nthis incongruous expression of the solicitude felt during the day, and\nanalysis revealed the connection. I identified my friend Otto with a\ncertain Baron L. and myself with a Professor R. There was only one\nexplanation for my being impelled to select just this substitution for\nthe day thought. I must have always been prepared in the Unc. to\nidentify myself with Professor R., as it meant the realization of one of\nthe immortal infantile wishes, viz. that of becoming great. Repulsive\nideas respecting my friend, that would certainly have been repudiated\nin a waking state, took advantage of the opportunity to creep into the\ndream, but the worry of the day likewise found some form of expression\nthrough a substitution in the dream content. The day thought, which was\nno wish in itself but rather a worry, had in some way to find a\nconnection with the infantile now unconscious and suppressed wish, which\nthen allowed it, though already properly prepared, to \"originate\" for\nconsciousness. The more dominating this worry, the stronger must be the\nconnection to be established; between the contents of the wish and that\nof the worry there need be no connection, nor was there one in any of\nour examples.\nWe can now sharply define the significance of the unconscious wish for\nthe dream. It may be admitted that there is a whole class of dreams in\nwhich the incitement originates preponderatingly or even exclusively\nfrom the remnants of daily life; and I believe that even my cherished\ndesire to become at some future time a \"professor extraordinarius\" would\nhave allowed me to slumber undisturbed that night had not my worry about\nmy friend's health been still active. But this worry alone would not\nhave produced a dream; the motive power needed by the dream had to be\ncontributed by a wish, and it was the affair of the worriment to\nprocure for itself such wish as a motive power of the dream. To speak\nfiguratively, it is quite possible that a day thought plays the part of\nthe contractor (_entrepreneur_) in the dream. But it is known that no\nmatter what idea the contractor may have in mind, and how desirous he\nmay be of putting it into operation, he can do nothing without capital;\nhe must depend upon a capitalist to defray the necessary expenses, and\nthis capitalist, who supplies the psychic expenditure for the dream is\ninvariably and indisputably _a wish from the unconscious_, no matter\nwhat the nature of the waking thought may be.\nIn other cases the capitalist himself is the contractor for the dream;\nthis, indeed, seems to be the more usual case. An unconscious wish is\nproduced by the day's work, which in turn creates the dream. The dream\nprocesses, moreover, run parallel with all the other possibilities of\nthe economic relationship used here as an illustration. Thus, the\nentrepreneur may contribute some capital himself, or several\nentrepreneurs may seek the aid of the same capitalist, or several\ncapitalists may jointly supply the capital required by the entrepreneur.\nThus there are dreams produced by more than one dream-wish, and many\nsimilar variations which may readily be passed over and are of no\nfurther interest to us. What we have left unfinished in this discussion\nof the dream-wish we shall be able to develop later.\nThe \"tertium comparationis\" in the comparisons just employed--_i.e._ the\nsum placed at our free disposal in proper allotment--admits of still\nfiner application for the illustration of the dream structure. We can\nrecognize in most dreams a center especially supplied with perceptible\nintensity. This is regularly the direct representation of the\nwish-fulfillment; for, if we undo the displacements of the dream-work by\na process of retrogression, we find that the psychic intensity of the\nelements in the dream thoughts is replaced by the perceptible intensity\nof the elements in the dream content. The elements adjoining the\nwish-fulfillment have frequently nothing to do with its sense, but prove\nto be descendants of painful thoughts which oppose the wish. But, owing\nto their frequently artificial connection with the central element, they\nhave acquired sufficient intensity to enable them to come to expression.\nThus, the force of expression of the wish-fulfillment is diffused over a\ncertain sphere of association, within which it raises to expression all\nelements, including those that are in themselves impotent. In dreams\nhaving several strong wishes we can readily separate from one another\nthe spheres of the individual wish-fulfillments; the gaps in the dream\nlikewise can often be explained as boundary zones.\nAlthough the foregoing remarks have considerably limited the\nsignificance of the day remnants for the dream, it will nevertheless be\nworth our while to give them some attention. For they must be a\nnecessary ingredient in the formation of the dream, inasmuch as\nexperience reveals the surprising fact that every dream shows in its\ncontent a connection with some impression of a recent day, often of the\nmost indifferent kind. So far we have failed to see any necessity for\nthis addition to the dream mixture. This necessity appears only when we\nfollow closely the part played by the unconscious wish, and then seek\ninformation in the psychology of the neuroses. We thus learn that the\nunconscious idea, as such, is altogether incapable of entering into the\nforeconscious, and that it can exert an influence there only by uniting\nwith a harmless idea already belonging to the foreconscious, to which it\ntransfers its intensity and under which it allows itself to be\nconcealed. This is the fact of transference which furnishes an\nexplanation for so many surprising occurrences in the psychic life of\nneurotics.\nThe idea from the foreconscious which thus obtains an unmerited\nabundance of intensity may be left unchanged by the transference, or it\nmay have forced upon it a modification from the content of the\ntransferring idea. I trust the reader will pardon my fondness for\ncomparisons from daily life, but I feel tempted to say that the\nrelations existing for the repressed idea are similar to the situations\nexisting in Austria for the American dentist, who is forbidden to\npractise unless he gets permission from a regular physician to use his\nname on the public signboard and thus cover the legal requirements.\nMoreover, just as it is naturally not the busiest physicians who form\nsuch alliances with dental practitioners, so in the psychic life only\nsuch foreconscious or conscious ideas are chosen to cover a repressed\nidea as have not themselves attracted much of the attention which is\noperative in the foreconscious. The unconscious entangles with its\nconnections preferentially either those impressions and ideas of the\nforeconscious which have been left unnoticed as indifferent, or those\nthat have soon been deprived of this attention through rejection. It is\na familiar fact from the association studies confirmed by every\nexperience, that ideas which have formed intimate connections in one\ndirection assume an almost negative attitude to whole groups of new\nconnections. I once tried from this principle to develop a theory for\nhysterical paralysis.\nIf we assume that the same need for the transference of the repressed\nideas which we have learned to know from the analysis of the neuroses\nmakes its influence felt in the dream as well, we can at once explain\ntwo riddles of the dream, viz. that every dream analysis shows an\ninterweaving of a recent impression, and that this recent element is\nfrequently of the most indifferent character. We may add what we have\nalready learned elsewhere, that these recent and indifferent elements\ncome so frequently into the dream content as a substitute for the most\ndeep-lying of the dream thoughts, for the further reason that they have\nleast to fear from the resisting censor. But while this freedom from\ncensorship explains only the preference for trivial elements, the\nconstant presence of recent elements points to the fact that there is a\nneed for transference. Both groups of impressions satisfy the demand of\nthe repression for material still free from associations, the\nindifferent ones because they have offered no inducement for extensive\nassociations, and the recent ones because they have had insufficient\ntime to form such associations.\nWe thus see that the day remnants, among which we may now include the\nindifferent impressions when they participate in the dream formation,\nnot only borrow from the Unc. the motive power at the disposal of the\nrepressed wish, but also offer to the unconscious something\nindispensable, namely, the attachment necessary to the transference. If\nwe here attempted to penetrate more deeply into the psychic processes,\nwe should first have to throw more light on the play of emotions between\nthe foreconscious and the unconscious, to which, indeed, we are urged by\nthe study of the psychoneuroses, whereas the dream itself offers no\nassistance in this respect.\nJust one further remark about the day remnants. There is no doubt that\nthey are the actual disturbers of sleep, and not the dream, which, on\nthe contrary, strives to guard sleep. But we shall return to this point\nlater.\nWe have so far discussed the dream-wish, we have traced it to the sphere\nof the Unc., and analyzed its relations to the day remnants, which in\nturn may be either wishes, psychic emotions of any other kind, or simply\nrecent impressions. We have thus made room for any claims that may be\nmade for the importance of conscious thought activity in dream\nformations in all its variations. Relying upon our thought series, it\nwould not be at all impossible for us to explain even those extreme\ncases in which the dream as a continuer of the day work brings to a\nhappy conclusion and unsolved problem possess an example, the analysis\nof which might reveal the infantile or repressed wish source furnishing\nsuch alliance and successful strengthening of the efforts of the\nforeconscious activity. But we have not come one step nearer a solution\nof the riddle: Why can the unconscious furnish the motive power for the\nwish-fulfillment only during sleep? The answer to this question must\nthrow light on the psychic nature of wishes; and it will be given with\nthe aid of the diagram of the psychic apparatus.\nWe do not doubt that even this apparatus attained its present perfection\nthrough a long course of development. Let us attempt to restore it as it\nexisted in an early phase of its activity. From assumptions, to be\nconfirmed elsewhere, we know that at first the apparatus strove to keep\nas free from excitement as possible, and in its first formation,\ntherefore, the scheme took the form of a reflex apparatus, which enabled\nit promptly to discharge through the motor tracts any sensible stimulus\nreaching it from without. But this simple function was disturbed by the\nwants of life, which likewise furnish the impulse for the further\ndevelopment of the apparatus. The wants of life first manifested\nthemselves to it in the form of the great physical needs. The excitement\naroused by the inner want seeks an outlet in motility, which may be\ndesignated as \"inner changes\" or as an \"expression of the emotions.\" The\nhungry child cries or fidgets helplessly, but its situation remains\nunchanged; for the excitation proceeding from an inner want requires,\nnot a momentary outbreak, but a force working continuously. A change can\noccur only if in some way a feeling of gratification is\nexperienced--which in the case of the child must be through outside\nhelp--in order to remove the inner excitement. An essential constituent\nof this experience is the appearance of a certain perception (of food in\nour example), the memory picture of which thereafter remains associated\nwith the memory trace of the excitation of want.\nThanks to the established connection, there results at the next\nappearance of this want a psychic feeling which revives the memory\npicture of the former perception, and thus recalls the former perception\nitself, _i.e._ it actually re-establishes the situation of the first\ngratification. We call such a feeling a wish; the reappearance of the\nperception constitutes the wish-fulfillment, and the full revival of the\nperception by the want excitement constitutes the shortest road to the\nwish-fulfillment. We may assume a primitive condition of the psychic\napparatus in which this road is really followed, _i.e._ where the\nwishing merges into an hallucination, This first psychic activity\ntherefore aims at an identity of perception, _i.e._ it aims at a\nrepetition of that perception which is connected with the fulfillment of\nthe want.\nThis primitive mental activity must have been modified by bitter\npractical experience into a more expedient secondary activity. The\nestablishment of the identity perception on the short regressive road\nwithin the apparatus does not in another respect carry with it the\nresult which inevitably follows the revival of the same perception from\nwithout. The gratification does not take place, and the want continues.\nIn order to equalize the internal with the external sum of energy, the\nformer must be continually maintained, just as actually happens in the\nhallucinatory psychoses and in the deliriums of hunger which exhaust\ntheir psychic capacity in clinging to the object desired. In order to\nmake more appropriate use of the psychic force, it becomes necessary to\ninhibit the full regression so as to prevent it from extending beyond\nthe image of memory, whence it can select other paths leading ultimately\nto the establishment of the desired identity from the outer world. This\ninhibition and consequent deviation from the excitation becomes the\ntask of a second system which dominates the voluntary motility, _i.e._\nthrough whose activity the expenditure of motility is now devoted to\npreviously recalled purposes. But this entire complicated mental\nactivity which works its way from the memory picture to the\nestablishment of the perception identity from the outer world merely\nrepresents a detour which has been forced upon the wish-fulfillment by\nexperience.[2] Thinking is indeed nothing but the equivalent of the\nhallucinatory wish; and if the dream be called a wish-fulfillment this\nbecomes self-evident, as nothing but a wish can impel our psychic\napparatus to activity. The dream, which in fulfilling its wishes follows\nthe short regressive path, thereby preserves for us only an example of\nthe primary form of the psychic apparatus which has been abandoned as\ninexpedient. What once ruled in the waking state when the psychic life\nwas still young and unfit seems to have been banished into the sleeping\nstate, just as we see again in the nursery the bow and arrow, the\ndiscarded primitive weapons of grown-up humanity. _The dream is a\nfragment of the abandoned psychic life of the child._ In the psychoses\nthese modes of operation of the psychic apparatus, which are normally\nsuppressed in the waking state, reassert themselves, and then betray\ntheir inability to satisfy our wants in the outer world.\nThe unconscious wish-feelings evidently strive to assert themselves\nduring the day also, and the fact of transference and the psychoses\nteach us that they endeavor to penetrate to consciousness and dominate\nmotility by the road leading through the system of the foreconscious. It\nis, therefore, the censor lying between the Unc. and the Forec., the\nassumption of which is forced upon us by the dream, that we have to\nrecognize and honor as the guardian of our psychic health. But is it not\ncarelessness on the part of this guardian to diminish its vigilance\nduring the night and to allow the suppressed emotions of the Unc. to\ncome to expression, thus again making possible the hallucinatory\nregression? I think not, for when the critical guardian goes to\nrest--and we have proof that his slumber is not profound--he takes care\nto close the gate to motility. No matter what feelings from the\notherwise inhibited Unc. may roam about on the scene, they need not be\ninterfered with; they remain harmless because they are unable to put in\nmotion the motor apparatus which alone can exert a modifying influence\nupon the outer world. Sleep guarantees the security of the fortress\nwhich is under guard. Conditions are less harmless when a displacement\nof forces is produced, not through a nocturnal diminution in the\noperation of the critical censor, but through pathological enfeeblement\nof the latter or through pathological reinforcement of the unconscious\nexcitations, and this while the foreconscious is charged with energy and\nthe avenues to motility are open. The guardian is then overpowered, the\nunconscious excitations subdue the Forec.; through it they dominate our\nspeech and actions, or they enforce the hallucinatory regression, thus\ngoverning an apparatus not designed for them by virtue of the attraction\nexerted by the perceptions on the distribution of our psychic energy. We\ncall this condition a psychosis.\nWe are now in the best position to complete our psychological\nconstruction, which has been interrupted by the introduction of the two\nsystems, Unc. and Forec. We have still, however, ample reason for giving\nfurther consideration to the wish as the sole psychic motive power in\nthe dream. We have explained that the reason why the dream is in every\ncase a wish realization is because it is a product of the Unc., which\nknows no other aim in its activity but the fulfillment of wishes, and\nwhich has no other forces at its disposal but wish-feelings. If we\navail ourselves for a moment longer of the right to elaborate from the\ndream interpretation such far-reaching psychological speculations, we\nare in duty bound to demonstrate that we are thereby bringing the dream\ninto a relationship which may also comprise other psychic structures. If\nthere exists a system of the Unc.--or something sufficiently analogous\nto it for the purpose of our discussion--the dream cannot be its sole\nmanifestation; every dream may be a wish-fulfillment, but there must be\nother forms of abnormal wish-fulfillment beside this of dreams. Indeed,\nthe theory of all psychoneurotic symptoms culminates in the proposition\n_that they too must be taken as wish-fulfillments of the unconscious_.\nOur explanation makes the dream only the first member of a group most\nimportant for the psychiatrist, an understanding of which means the\nsolution of the purely psychological part of the psychiatric problem.\nBut other members of this group of wish-fulfillments, _e.g._, the\nhysterical symptoms, evince one essential quality which I have so far\nfailed to find in the dream. Thus, from the investigations frequently\nreferred to in this treatise, I know that the formation of an hysterical\nsymptom necessitates the combination of both streams of our psychic\nlife. The symptom is not merely the expression of a realized\nunconscious wish, but it must be joined by another wish from the\nforeconscious which is fulfilled by the same symptom; so that the\nsymptom is at least doubly determined, once by each one of the\nconflicting systems. Just as in the dream, there is no limit to further\nover-determination. The determination not derived from the Unc. is, as\nfar as I can see, invariably a stream of thought in reaction against the\nunconscious wish, _e.g._, a self-punishment. Hence I may say, in\ngeneral, that _an hysterical symptom originates only where two\ncontrasting wish-fulfillments, having their source in different psychic\nsystems, are able to combine in one expression_. (Compare my latest\nformulation of the origin of the hysterical symptoms in a treatise\npublished by the _Zeitschrift f\u00fcr Sexualwissenschaft_, by Hirschfeld and\nothers, 1908). Examples on this point would prove of little value, as\nnothing but a complete unveiling of the complication in question would\ncarry conviction. I therefore content myself with the mere assertion,\nand will cite an example, not for conviction but for explication. The\nhysterical vomiting of a female patient proved, on the one hand, to be\nthe realization of an unconscious fancy from the time of puberty, that\nshe might be continuously pregnant and have a multitude of children,\nand this was subsequently united with the wish that she might have them\nfrom as many men as possible. Against this immoderate wish there arose a\npowerful defensive impulse. But as the vomiting might spoil the\npatient's figure and beauty, so that she would not find favor in the\neyes of mankind, the symptom was therefore in keeping with her punitive\ntrend of thought, and, being thus admissible from both sides, it was\nallowed to become a reality. This is the same manner of consenting to a\nwish-fulfillment which the queen of the Parthians chose for the triumvir\nCrassus. Believing that he had undertaken the campaign out of greed for\ngold, she caused molten gold to be poured into the throat of the corpse.\n\"Now hast thou what thou hast longed for.\" As yet we know of the dream\nonly that it expresses a wish-fulfillment of the unconscious; and\napparently the dominating foreconscious permits this only after it has\nsubjected the wish to some distortions. We are really in no position to\ndemonstrate regularly a stream of thought antagonistic to the dream-wish\nwhich is realized in the dream as in its counterpart. Only now and then\nhave we found in the dream traces of reaction formations, as, for\ninstance, the tenderness toward friend R. in the \"uncle dream.\" But the\ncontribution from the foreconscious, which is missing here, may be\nfound in another place. While the dominating system has withdrawn on\nthe wish to sleep, the dream may bring to expression with manifold\ndistortions a wish from the Unc., and realize this wish by producing the\nnecessary changes of energy in the psychic apparatus, and may finally\nretain it through the entire duration of sleep.[3]\nThis persistent wish to sleep on the part of the foreconscious in\ngeneral facilitates the formation of the dream. Let us refer to the\ndream of the father who, by the gleam of light from the death chamber,\nwas brought to the conclusion that the body has been set on fire. We\nhave shown that one of the psychic forces decisive in causing the father\nto form this conclusion, instead of being awakened by the gleam of\nlight, was the wish to prolong the life of the child seen in the dream\nby one moment. Other wishes proceeding from the repression probably\nescape us, because we are unable to analyze this dream. But as a second\nmotive power of the dream we may mention the father's desire to sleep,\nfor, like the life of the child, the sleep of the father is prolonged\nfor a moment by the dream. The underlying motive is: \"Let the dream go\non, otherwise I must wake up.\" As in this dream so also in all other\ndreams, the wish to sleep lends its support to the unconscious wish. We\nreported dreams which were apparently dreams of convenience. But,\nproperly speaking, all dreams may claim this designation. The efficacy\nof the wish to continue to sleep is the most easily recognized in the\nwaking dreams, which so transform the objective sensory stimulus as to\nrender it compatible with the continuance of sleep; they interweave this\nstimulus with the dream in order to rob it of any claims it might make\nas a warning to the outer world. But this wish to continue to sleep must\nalso participate in the formation of all other dreams which may disturb\nthe sleeping state from within only. \"Now, then, sleep on; why, it's but\na dream\"; this is in many cases the suggestion of the Forec. to\nconsciousness when the dream goes too far; and this also describes in a\ngeneral way the attitude of our dominating psychic activity toward\ndreaming, though the thought remains tacit. I must draw the conclusion\nthat _throughout our entire sleeping state we are just as certain that\nwe are dreaming as we are certain that we are sleeping_. We are\ncompelled to disregard the objection urged against this conclusion that\nour consciousness is never directed to a knowledge of the former, and\nthat it is directed to a knowledge of the latter only on special\noccasions when the censor is unexpectedly surprised. Against this\nobjection we may say that there are persons who are entirely conscious\nof their sleeping and dreaming, and who are apparently endowed with the\nconscious faculty of guiding their dream life. Such a dreamer, when\ndissatisfied with the course taken by the dream, breaks it off without\nawakening, and begins it anew in order to continue it with a different\nturn, like the popular author who, on request, gives a happier ending to\nhis play. Or, at another time, if placed by the dream in a sexually\nexciting situation, he thinks in his sleep: \"I do not care to continue\nthis dream and exhaust myself by a pollution; I prefer to defer it in\nfavor of a real situation.\"\n[1] They share this character of indestructibility with all psychic acts\nthat are really unconscious--that is, with psychic acts belonging to the\nsystem of the unconscious only. These paths are constantly open and\nnever fall into disuse; they conduct the discharge of the exciting\nprocess as often as it becomes endowed with unconscious excitement To\nspeak metaphorically they suffer the same form of annihilation as the\nshades of the lower region in the _Odyssey_, who awoke to new life the\nmoment they drank blood. The processes depending on the foreconscious\nsystem are destructible in a different way. The psychotherapy of the\nneuroses is based on this difference.\n[2] Le Lorrain justly extols the wish-fulfilment of the dream: \"Sans\nfatigue s\u00e9rieuse, sans \u00eatre oblig\u00e9 de recourir \u00e0 cette lutte opin\u00e2tre et\nlongue qui use et corrode les jouissances poursuivies.\"\n[3] This idea has been borrowed from _The Theory of Sleep_ by Li\u00e9bault,\nwho revived hypnotic investigation in our days. (_Du Sommeil provoqu\u00e9_,\netc.; Paris, 1889.)\nVII\nTHE FUNCTION OF THE DREAM\nSince we know that the foreconscious is suspended during the night by\nthe wish to sleep, we can proceed to an intelligent investigation of the\ndream process. But let us first sum up the knowledge of this process\nalready gained. We have shown that the waking activity leaves day\nremnants from which the sum of energy cannot be entirely removed; or the\nwaking activity revives during the day one of the unconscious wishes; or\nboth conditions occur simultaneously; we have already discovered the\nmany variations that may take place. The unconscious wish has already\nmade its way to the day remnants, either during the day or at any rate\nwith the beginning of sleep, and has effected a transference to it. This\nproduces a wish transferred to the recent material, or the suppressed\nrecent wish comes to life again through a reinforcement from the\nunconscious. This wish now endeavors to make its way to consciousness on\nthe normal path of the mental processes through the foreconscious, to\nwhich indeed it belongs through one of its constituent elements. It is\nconfronted, however, by the censor, which is still active, and to the\ninfluence of which it now succumbs. It now takes on the distortion for\nwhich the way has already been paved by its transference to the recent\nmaterial. Thus far it is in the way of becoming something resembling an\nobsession, delusion, or the like, _i.e._ a thought reinforced by a\ntransference and distorted in expression by the censor. But its further\nprogress is now checked through the dormant state of the foreconscious;\nthis system has apparently protected itself against invasion by\ndiminishing its excitements. The dream process, therefore, takes the\nregressive course, which has just been opened by the peculiarity of the\nsleeping state, and thereby follows the attraction exerted on it by the\nmemory groups, which themselves exist in part only as visual energy not\nyet translated into terms of the later systems. On its way to regression\nthe dream takes on the form of dramatization. The subject of compression\nwill be discussed later. The dream process has now terminated the second\npart of its repeatedly impeded course. The first part expended itself\nprogressively from the unconscious scenes or phantasies to the\nforeconscious, while the second part gravitates from the advent of the\ncensor back to the perceptions. But when the dream process becomes a\ncontent of perception it has, so to speak, eluded the obstacle set up in\nthe Forec. by the censor and by the sleeping state. It succeeds in\ndrawing attention to itself and in being noticed by consciousness. For\nconsciousness, which means to us a sensory organ for the reception of\npsychic qualities, may receive stimuli from two sources--first, from the\nperiphery of the entire apparatus, viz. from the perception system, and,\nsecondly, from the pleasure and pain stimuli, which constitute the sole\npsychic quality produced in the transformation of energy within the\napparatus. All other processes in the system, even those in the\nforeconscious, are devoid of any psychic quality, and are therefore not\nobjects of consciousness inasmuch as they do not furnish pleasure or\npain for perception. We shall have to assume that those liberations of\npleasure and pain automatically regulate the outlet of the occupation\nprocesses. But in order to make possible more delicate functions, it was\nlater found necessary to render the course of the presentations more\nindependent of the manifestations of pain. To accomplish this the Forec.\nsystem needed some qualities of its own which could attract\nconsciousness, and most probably received them through the connection of\nthe foreconscious processes with the memory system of the signs of\nspeech, which is not devoid of qualities. Through the qualities of this\nsystem, consciousness, which had hitherto been a sensory organ only for\nthe perceptions, now becomes also a sensory organ for a part of our\nmental processes. Thus we have now, as it were, two sensory surfaces,\none directed to perceptions and the other to the foreconscious mental\nprocesses.\nI must assume that the sensory surface of consciousness devoted to the\nForec. is rendered less excitable by sleep than that directed to the\nP-systems. The giving up of interest for the nocturnal mental processes\nis indeed purposeful. Nothing is to disturb the mind; the Forec. wants\nto sleep. But once the dream becomes a perception, it is then capable of\nexciting consciousness through the qualities thus gained. The sensory\nstimulus accomplishes what it was really destined for, namely, it\ndirects a part of the energy at the disposal of the Forec. in the form\nof attention upon the stimulant. We must, therefore, admit that the\ndream invariably awakens us, that is, it puts into activity a part of\nthe dormant force of the Forec. This force imparts to the dream that\ninfluence which we have designated as secondary elaboration for the sake\nof connection and comprehensibility. This means that the dream is\ntreated by it like any other content of perception; it is subjected to\nthe same ideas of expectation, as far at least as the material admits.\nAs far as the direction is concerned in this third part of the dream, it\nmay be said that here again the movement is progressive.\nTo avoid misunderstanding, it will not be amiss to say a few words about\nthe temporal peculiarities of these dream processes. In a very\ninteresting discussion, apparently suggested by Maury's puzzling\nguillotine dream, Goblet tries to demonstrate that the dream requires no\nother time than the transition period between sleeping and awakening.\nThe awakening requires time, as the dream takes place during that\nperiod. One is inclined to believe that the final picture of the dream\nis so strong that it forces the dreamer to awaken; but, as a matter of\nfact, this picture is strong only because the dreamer is already very\nnear awakening when it appears. \"Un r\u00eave c'est un r\u00e9veil qui commence.\"\nIt has already been emphasized by Dugas that Goblet was forced to\nrepudiate many facts in order to generalize his theory. There are,\nmoreover, dreams from which we do not awaken, _e.g._, some dreams in\nwhich we dream that we dream. From our knowledge of the dream-work, we\ncan by no means admit that it extends only over the period of awakening.\nOn the contrary, we must consider it probable that the first part of\nthe dream-work begins during the day when we are still under the\ndomination of the foreconscious. The second phase of the dream-work,\nviz. the modification through the censor, the attraction by the\nunconscious scenes, and the penetration to perception must continue\nthroughout the night. And we are probably always right when we assert\nthat we feel as though we had been dreaming the whole night, although we\ncannot say what. I do not, however, think it necessary to assume that,\nup to the time of becoming conscious, the dream processes really follow\nthe temporal sequence which we have described, viz. that there is first\nthe transferred dream-wish, then the distortion of the censor, and\nconsequently the change of direction to regression, and so on. We were\nforced to form such a succession for the sake of _description_; in\nreality, however, it is much rather a matter of simultaneously trying\nthis path and that, and of emotions fluctuating to and fro, until\nfinally, owing to the most expedient distribution, one particular\ngrouping is secured which remains. From certain personal experiences, I\nam myself inclined to believe that the dream-work often requires more\nthan one day and one night to produce its result; if this be true, the\nextraordinary art manifested in the construction of the dream loses all\nits marvels. In my opinion, even the regard for comprehensibility as an\noccurrence of perception may take effect before the dream attracts\nconsciousness to itself. To be sure, from now on the process is\naccelerated, as the dream is henceforth subjected to the same treatment\nas any other perception. It is like fireworks, which require hours of\npreparation and only a moment for ignition.\nThrough the dream-work the dream process now gains either sufficient\nintensity to attract consciousness to itself and arouse the\nforeconscious, which is quite independent of the time or profundity of\nsleep, or, its intensity being insufficient it must wait until it meets\nthe attention which is set in motion immediately before awakening. Most\ndreams seem to operate with relatively slight psychic intensities, for\nthey wait for the awakening. This, however, explains the fact that we\nregularly perceive something dreamt on being suddenly aroused from a\nsound sleep. Here, as well as in spontaneous awakening, the first glance\nstrikes the perception content created by the dream-work, while the next\nstrikes the one produced from without.\nBut of greater theoretical interest are those dreams which are capable\nof waking us in the midst of sleep. We must bear in mind the expediency\nelsewhere universally demonstrated, and ask ourselves why the dream or\nthe unconscious wish has the power to disturb sleep, _i.e._ the\nfulfillment of the foreconscious wish. This is probably due to certain\nrelations of energy into which we have no insight. If we possessed such\ninsight we should probably find that the freedom given to the dream and\nthe expenditure of a certain amount of detached attention represent for\nthe dream an economy in energy, keeping in view the fact that the\nunconscious must be held in check at night just as during the day. We\nknow from experience that the dream, even if it interrupts sleep,\nrepeatedly during the same night, still remains compatible with sleep.\nWe wake up for an instant, and immediately resume our sleep. It is like\ndriving off a fly during sleep, we awake _ad hoc_, and when we resume\nour sleep we have removed the disturbance. As demonstrated by familiar\nexamples from the sleep of wet nurses, &c., the fulfillment of the wish\nto sleep is quite compatible with the retention of a certain amount of\nattention in a given direction.\nBut we must here take cognizance of an objection that is based on a\nbetter knowledge of the unconscious processes. Although we have\nourselves described the unconscious wishes as always active, we have,\nnevertheless, asserted that they are not sufficiently strong during the\nday to make themselves perceptible. But when we sleep, and the\nunconscious wish has shown its power to form a dream, and with it to\nawaken the foreconscious, why, then, does this power become exhausted\nafter the dream has been taken cognizance of? Would it not seem more\nprobable that the dream should continually renew itself, like the\ntroublesome fly which, when driven away, takes pleasure in returning\nagain and again? What justifies our assertion that the dream removes the\ndisturbance of sleep?\nThat the unconscious wishes always remain active is quite true. They\nrepresent paths which are passable whenever a sum of excitement makes\nuse of them. Moreover, a remarkable peculiarity of the unconscious\nprocesses is the fact that they remain indestructible. Nothing can be\nbrought to an end in the unconscious; nothing can cease or be forgotten.\nThis impression is most strongly gained in the study of the neuroses,\nespecially of hysteria. The unconscious stream of thought which leads to\nthe discharge through an attack becomes passable again as soon as there\nis an accumulation of a sufficient amount of excitement. The\nmortification brought on thirty years ago, after having gained access to\nthe unconscious affective source, operates during all these thirty years\nlike a recent one. Whenever its memory is touched, it is revived and\nshows itself to be supplied with the excitement which is discharged in\na motor attack. It is just here that the office of psychotherapy begins,\nits task being to bring about adjustment and forgetfulness for the\nunconscious processes. Indeed, the fading of memories and the flagging\nof affects, which we are apt to take as self-evident and to explain as a\nprimary influence of time on the psychic memories, are in reality\nsecondary changes brought about by painstaking work. It is the\nforeconscious that accomplishes this work; and the only course to be\npursued by psychotherapy is the subjugate the Unc, to the domination of\nthe Forec.\nThere are, therefore, two exits for the individual unconscious emotional\nprocess. It is either left to itself, in which case it ultimately breaks\nthrough somewhere and secures for once a discharge for its excitation\ninto motility; or it succumbs to the influence of the foreconscious, and\nits excitation becomes confined through this influence instead of being\ndischarged. It is the latter process that occurs in the dream. Owing to\nthe fact that it is directed by the conscious excitement, the energy\nfrom the Forec., which confronts the dream when grown to perception,\nrestricts the unconscious excitement of the dream and renders it\nharmless as a disturbing factor. When the dreamer wakes up for a moment,\nhe has actually chased away the fly that has threatened to disturb his\nsleep. We can now understand that it is really more expedient and\neconomical to give full sway to the unconscious wish, and clear its way\nto regression so that it may form a dream, and then restrict and adjust\nthis dream by means of a small expenditure of foreconscious labor, than\nto curb the unconscious throughout the entire period of sleep. We\nshould, indeed, expect that the dream, even if it was not originally an\nexpedient process, would have acquired some function in the play of\nforces of the psychic life. We now see what this function is. The dream\nhas taken it upon itself to bring the liberated excitement of the Unc.\nback under the domination of the foreconscious; it thus affords relief\nfor the excitement of the Unc. and acts as a safety-valve for the\nlatter, and at the same time it insures the sleep of the foreconscious\nat a slight expenditure of the waking state. Like the other psychic\nformations of its group, the dream offers itself as a compromise serving\nsimultaneously both systems by fulfilling both wishes in so far as they\nare compatible with each other. A glance at Robert's \"elimination\ntheory,\" will show that we must agree with this author in his main\npoint, viz. in the determination of the function of the dream, though we\ndiffer from him in our hypotheses and in our treatment of the dream\nprocess.\nThe above qualification--in so far as the two wishes are compatible with\neach other--contains a suggestion that there may be cases in which the\nfunction of the dream suffers shipwreck. The dream process is in the\nfirst instance admitted as a wish-fulfillment of the unconscious, but if\nthis tentative wish-fulfillment disturbs the foreconscious to such an\nextent that the latter can no longer maintain its rest, the dream then\nbreaks the compromise and fails to perform the second part of its task.\nIt is then at once broken off, and replaced by complete wakefulness.\nHere, too, it is not really the fault of the dream, if, while ordinarily\nthe guardian of sleep, it is here compelled to appear as the disturber\nof sleep, nor should this cause us to entertain any doubts as to its\nefficacy. This is not the only case in the organism in which an\notherwise efficacious arrangement became inefficacious and disturbing as\nsoon as some element is changed in the conditions of its origin; the\ndisturbance then serves at least the new purpose of announcing the\nchange, and calling into play against it the means of adjustment of the\norganism. In this connection, I naturally bear in mind the case of the\nanxiety dream, and in order not to have the appearance of trying to\nexclude this testimony against the theory of wish-fulfillment wherever\nI encounter it, I will attempt an explanation of the anxiety dream, at\nleast offering some suggestions.\nThat a psychic process developing anxiety may still be a\nwish-fulfillment has long ceased to impress us as a contradiction. We\nmay explain this occurrence by the fact that the wish belongs to one\nsystem (the Unc.), while by the other system (the Forec.), this wish has\nbeen rejected and suppressed. The subjection of the Unc. by the Forec.\nis not complete even in perfect psychic health; the amount of this\nsuppression shows the degree of our psychic normality. Neurotic symptoms\nshow that there is a conflict between the two systems; the symptoms are\nthe results of a compromise of this conflict, and they temporarily put\nan end to it. On the one hand, they afford the Unc. an outlet for the\ndischarge of its excitement, and serve it as a sally port, while, on the\nother hand, they give the Forec. the capability of dominating the Unc.\nto some extent. It is highly instructive to consider, _e.g._, the\nsignificance of any hysterical phobia or of an agoraphobia. Suppose a\nneurotic incapable of crossing the street alone, which we would justly\ncall a \"symptom.\" We attempt to remove this symptom by urging him to the\naction which he deems himself incapable of. The result will be an\nattack of anxiety, just as an attack of anxiety in the street has often\nbeen the cause of establishing an agoraphobia. We thus learn that the\nsymptom has been constituted in order to guard against the outbreak of\nthe anxiety. The phobia is thrown before the anxiety like a fortress on\nthe frontier.\nUnless we enter into the part played by the affects in these processes,\nwhich can be done here only imperfectly, we cannot continue our\ndiscussion. Let us therefore advance the proposition that the reason why\nthe suppression of the unconscious becomes absolutely necessary is\nbecause, if the discharge of presentation should be left to itself, it\nwould develop an affect in the Unc. which originally bore the character\nof pleasure, but which, since the appearance of the repression, bears\nthe character of pain. The aim, as well as the result, of the\nsuppression is to stop the development of this pain. The suppression\nextends over the unconscious ideation, because the liberation of pain\nmight emanate from the ideation. The foundation is here laid for a very\ndefinite assumption concerning the nature of the affective development.\nIt is regarded as a motor or secondary activity, the key to the\ninnervation of which is located in the presentations of the Unc. Through\nthe domination of the Forec. these presentations become, as it were,\nthrottled and inhibited at the exit of the emotion-developing impulses.\nThe danger, which is due to the fact that the Forec. ceases to occupy\nthe energy, therefore consists in the fact that the unconscious\nexcitations liberate such an affect as--in consequence of the repression\nthat has previously taken place--can only be perceived as pain or\nanxiety.\nThis danger is released through the full sway of the dream process. The\ndeterminations for its realization consist in the fact that repressions\nhave taken place, and that the suppressed emotional wishes shall become\nsufficiently strong. They thus stand entirely without the psychological\nrealm of the dream structure. Were it not for the fact that our subject\nis connected through just one factor, namely, the freeing of the Unc.\nduring sleep, with the subject of the development of anxiety, I could\ndispense with discussion of the anxiety dream, and thus avoid all\nobscurities connected with it.\nAs I have often repeated, the theory of the anxiety belongs to the\npsychology of the neuroses. I would say that the anxiety in the dream is\nan anxiety problem and not a dream problem. We have nothing further to\ndo with it after having once demonstrated its point of contact with the\nsubject of the dream process. There is only one thing left for me to do.\nAs I have asserted that the neurotic anxiety originates from sexual\nsources, I can subject anxiety dreams to analysis in order to\ndemonstrate the sexual material in their dream thoughts.\nFor good reasons I refrain from citing here any of the numerous examples\nplaced at my disposal by neurotic patients, but prefer to give anxiety\ndreams from young persons.\nPersonally, I have had no real anxiety dream for decades, but I recall\none from my seventh or eighth year which I subjected to interpretation\nabout thirty years later. The dream was very vivid, and showed me _my\nbeloved mother, with peculiarly calm sleeping countenance, carried into\nthe room and laid on the bed by two (or three) persons with birds'\nbeaks_. I awoke crying and screaming, and disturbed my parents. The very\ntall figures--draped in a peculiar manner--with beaks, I had taken from\nthe illustrations of Philippson's bible; I believe they represented\ndeities with heads of sparrowhawks from an Egyptian tomb relief. The\nanalysis also introduced the reminiscence of a naughty janitor's boy,\nwho used to play with us children on the meadow in front of the house; I\nwould add that his name was Philip. I feel that I first heard from this\nboy the vulgar word signifying sexual intercourse, which is replaced\namong the educated by the Latin \"coitus,\" but to which the dream\ndistinctly alludes by the selection of the birds' heads. I must have\nsuspected the sexual significance of the word from the facial expression\nof my worldly-wise teacher. My mother's features in the dream were\ncopied from the countenance of my grandfather, whom I had seen a few\ndays before his death snoring in the state of coma. The interpretation\nof the secondary elaboration in the dream must therefore have been that\nmy mother was dying; the tomb relief, too, agrees with this. In this\nanxiety I awoke, and could not calm myself until I had awakened my\nparents. I remember that I suddenly became calm on coming face to face\nwith my mother, as if I needed the assurance that my mother was not\ndead. But this secondary interpretation of the dream had been effected\nonly under the influence of the developed anxiety. I was not frightened\nbecause I dreamed that my mother was dying, but I interpreted the dream\nin this manner in the foreconscious elaboration because I was already\nunder the domination of the anxiety. The latter, however, could be\ntraced by means of the repression to an obscure obviously sexual desire,\nwhich had found its satisfying expression in the visual content of the\ndream.\nA man twenty-seven years old who had been severely ill for a year had\nhad many terrifying dreams between the ages of eleven and thirteen. He\nthought that a man with an ax was running after him; he wished to run,\nbut felt paralyzed and could not move from the spot. This may be taken\nas a good example of a very common, and apparently sexually indifferent,\nanxiety dream. In the analysis the dreamer first thought of a story told\nhim by his uncle, which chronologically was later than the dream, viz.\nthat he was attacked at night by a suspicious-looking individual. This\noccurrence led him to believe that he himself might have already heard\nof a similar episode at the time of the dream. In connection with the ax\nhe recalled that during that period of his life he once hurt his hand\nwith an ax while chopping wood. This immediately led to his relations\nwith his younger brother, whom he used to maltreat and knock down. In\nparticular, he recalled an occasion when he struck his brother on the\nhead with his boot until he bled, whereupon his mother remarked: \"I fear\nhe will kill him some day.\" While he was seemingly thinking of the\nsubject of violence, a reminiscence from his ninth year suddenly\noccurred to him. His parents came home late and went to bed while he was\nfeigning sleep. He soon heard panting and other noises that appeared\nstrange to him, and he could also make out the position of his parents\nin bed. His further associations showed that he had established an\nanalogy between this relation between his parents and his own relation\ntoward his younger brother. He subsumed what occurred between his\nparents under the conception \"violence and wrestling,\" and thus reached\na sadistic conception of the coitus act, as often happens among\nchildren. The fact that he often noticed blood on his mother's bed\ncorroborated his conception.\nThat the sexual intercourse of adults appears strange to children who\nobserve it, and arouses fear in them, I dare say is a fact of daily\nexperience. I have explained this fear by the fact that sexual\nexcitement is not mastered by their understanding, and is probably also\ninacceptable to them because their parents are involved in it. For the\nsame son this excitement is converted into fear. At a still earlier\nperiod of life sexual emotion directed toward the parent of opposite sex\ndoes not meet with repression but finds free expression, as we have seen\nbefore.\nFor the night terrors with hallucinations (_pavor nocturnus_) frequently\nfound in children, I would unhesitatingly give the same explanation.\nHere, too, we are certainly dealing with the incomprehensible and\nrejected sexual feelings, which, if noted, would probably show a\ntemporal periodicity, for an enhancement of the sexual _libido_ may\njust as well be produced accidentally through emotional impressions as\nthrough the spontaneous and gradual processes of development.\nI lack the necessary material to sustain these explanations from\nobservation. On the other hand, the pediatrists seem to lack the point\nof view which alone makes comprehensible the whole series of phenomena,\non the somatic as well as on the psychic side. To illustrate by a\ncomical example how one wearing the blinders of medical mythology may\nmiss the understanding of such cases I will relate a case which I found\nin a thesis on _pavor nocturnus_ by _Debacker_, 1881. A\nthirteen-year-old boy of delicate health began to become anxious and\ndreamy; his sleep became restless, and about once a week it was\ninterrupted by an acute attack of anxiety with hallucinations. The\nmemory of these dreams was invariably very distinct. Thus, he related\nthat the _devil_ shouted at him: \"Now we have you, now we have you,\" and\nthis was followed by an odor of sulphur; the fire burned his skin. This\ndream aroused him, terror-stricken. He was unable to scream at first;\nthen his voice returned, and he was heard to say distinctly: \"No, no,\nnot me; why, I have done nothing,\" or, \"Please don't, I shall never do\nit again.\" Occasionally, also, he said: \"Albert has not done that.\"\nLater he avoided undressing, because, as he said, the fire attacked him\nonly when he was undressed. From amid these evil dreams, which menaced\nhis health, he was sent into the country, where he recovered within a\nyear and a half, but at the age of fifteen he once confessed: \"Je\nn'osais pas l'avouer, mais j'\u00e9prouvais continuellement des picotements\net des surexcitations aux _parties_; \u00e0 la fin, cela m'\u00e9nervait tant que\nplusieurs fois, j'ai pens\u00e9 me jeter par la fen\u00eatre au dortoir.\"\nIt is certainly not difficult to suspect: 1, that the boy had practiced\nmasturbation in former years, that he probably denied it, and was\nthreatened with severe punishment for his wrongdoing (his confession: Je\nne le ferai plus; his denial: Albert n'a jamais fait \u00e7a). 2, That under\nthe pressure of puberty the temptation to self-abuse through the\ntickling of the genitals was reawakened. 3, That now, however, a\nstruggle of repression arose in him, suppressing the _libido_ and\nchanging it into fear, which subsequently took the form of the\npunishments with which he was then threatened.\nLet us, however, quote the conclusions drawn by our author. This\nobservation shows: 1, That the influence of puberty may produce in a\nboy of delicate health a condition of extreme weakness, and that it may\nlead to a _very marked cerebral an\u00e6mia_.\n2. This cerebral an\u00e6mia produces a transformation of character,\ndemonomaniacal hallucinations, and very violent nocturnal, perhaps also\ndiurnal, states of anxiety.\n3. Demonomania and the self-reproaches of the day can be traced to the\ninfluences of religious education which the subject underwent as a\nchild.\n4. All manifestations disappeared as a result of a lengthy sojourn in\nthe country, bodily exercise, and the return of physical strength after\nthe termination of the period of puberty.\n5. A predisposing influence for the origin of the cerebral condition of\nthe boy may be attributed to heredity and to the father's chronic\nsyphilitic state.\nThe concluding remarks of the author read: \"Nous avons fait entrer cette\nobservation dans le cadre des d\u00e9lires apyr\u00e9tiques d'inanition, car c'est\n\u00e0 l'isch\u00e9mie c\u00e9r\u00e9brale que nous rattachons cet \u00e9tat particulier.\"\nVIII\nTHE PRIMARY AND SECONDARY PROCESS--REGRESSION\nIn venturing to attempt to penetrate more deeply into the psychology of\nthe dream processes, I have undertaken a difficult task, to which,\nindeed, my power of description is hardly equal. To reproduce in\ndescription by a succession of words the simultaneousness of so complex\na chain of events, and in doing so to appear unbiassed throughout the\nexposition, goes fairly beyond my powers. I have now to atone for the\nfact that I have been unable in my description of the dream psychology\nto follow the historic development of my views. The view-points for my\nconception of the dream were reached through earlier investigations in\nthe psychology of the neuroses, to which I am not supposed to refer\nhere, but to which I am repeatedly forced to refer, whereas I should\nprefer to proceed in the opposite direction, and, starting from the\ndream, to establish a connection with the psychology of the neuroses. I\nam well aware of all the inconveniences arising for the reader from this\ndifficulty, but I know of no way to avoid them.\nAs I am dissatisfied with this state of affairs, I am glad to dwell\nupon another view-point which seems to raise the value of my efforts. As\nhas been shown in the introduction to the first chapter, I found myself\nconfronted with a theme which had been marked by the sharpest\ncontradictions on the part of the authorities. After our elaboration of\nthe dream problems we found room for most of these contradictions. We\nhave been forced, however, to take decided exception to two of the views\npronounced, viz. that the dream is a senseless and that it is a somatic\nprocess; apart from these cases we have had to accept all the\ncontradictory views in one place or another of the complicated argument,\nand we have been able to demonstrate that they had discovered something\nthat was correct. That the dream continues the impulses and interests of\nthe waking state has been quite generally confirmed through the\ndiscovery of the latent thoughts of the dream. These thoughts concern\nthemselves only with things that seem important and of momentous\ninterest to us. The dream never occupies itself with trifles. But we\nhave also concurred with the contrary view, viz., that the dream gathers\nup the indifferent remnants from the day, and that not until it has in\nsome measure withdrawn itself from the waking activity can an important\nevent of the day be taken up by the dream. We found this holding true\nfor the dream content, which gives the dream thought its changed\nexpression by means of disfigurement. We have said that from the nature\nof the association mechanism the dream process more easily takes\npossession of recent or indifferent material which has not yet been\nseized by the waking mental activity; and by reason of the censor it\ntransfers the psychic intensity from the important but also disagreeable\nto the indifferent material. The hypermnesia of the dream and the resort\nto infantile material have become main supports in our theory. In our\ntheory of the dream we have attributed to the wish originating from the\ninfantile the part of an indispensable motor for the formation of the\ndream. We naturally could not think of doubting the experimentally\ndemonstrated significance of the objective sensory stimuli during sleep;\nbut we have brought this material into the same relation to the\ndream-wish as the thought remnants from the waking activity. There was\nno need of disputing the fact that the dream interprets the objective\nsensory stimuli after the manner of an illusion; but we have supplied\nthe motive for this interpretation which has been left undecided by the\nauthorities. The interpretation follows in such a manner that the\nperceived object is rendered harmless as a sleep disturber and becomes\navailable for the wish-fulfillment. Though we do not admit as special\nsources of the dream the subjective state of excitement of the sensory\norgans during sleep, which seems to have been demonstrated by Trumbull\nLadd, we are nevertheless able to explain this excitement through the\nregressive revival of active memories behind the dream. A modest part in\nour conception has also been assigned to the inner organic sensations\nwhich are wont to be taken as the cardinal point in the explanation of\nthe dream. These--the sensation of falling, flying, or inhibition--stand\nas an ever ready material to be used by the dream-work to express the\ndream thought as often as need arises.\nThat the dream process is a rapid and momentary one seems to be true for\nthe perception through consciousness of the already prepared dream\ncontent; the preceding parts of the dream process probably take a slow,\nfluctuating course. We have solved the riddle of the superabundant dream\ncontent compressed within the briefest moment by explaining that this is\ndue to the appropriation of almost fully formed structures from the\npsychic life. That the dream is disfigured and distorted by memory we\nfound to be correct, but not troublesome, as this is only the last\nmanifest operation in the work of disfigurement which has been active\nfrom the beginning of the dream-work. In the bitter and seemingly\nirreconcilable controversy as to whether the psychic life sleeps at\nnight or can make the same use of all its capabilities as during the\nday, we have been able to agree with both sides, though not fully with\neither. We have found proof that the dream thoughts represent a most\ncomplicated intellectual activity, employing almost every means\nfurnished by the psychic apparatus; still it cannot be denied that these\ndream thoughts have originated during the day, and it is indispensable\nto assume that there is a sleeping state of the psychic life. Thus, even\nthe theory of partial sleep has come into play; but the characteristics\nof the sleeping state have been found not in the dilapidation of the\npsychic connections but in the cessation of the psychic system\ndominating the day, arising from its desire to sleep. The withdrawal\nfrom the outer world retains its significance also for our conception;\nthough not the only factor, it nevertheless helps the regression to make\npossible the representation of the dream. That we should reject the\nvoluntary guidance of the presentation course is uncontestable; but the\npsychic life does not thereby become aimless, for we have seen that\nafter the abandonment of the desired end-presentation undesired ones\ngain the mastery. The loose associative connection in the dream we have\nnot only recognized, but we have placed under its control a far greater\nterritory than could have been supposed; we have, however, found it\nmerely the feigned substitute for another correct and senseful one. To\nbe sure we, too, have called the dream absurd; but we have been able to\nlearn from examples how wise the dream really is when it simulates\nabsurdity. We do not deny any of the functions that have been attributed\nto the dream. That the dream relieves the mind like a valve, and that,\naccording to Robert's assertion, all kinds of harmful material are\nrendered harmless through representation in the dream, not only exactly\ncoincides with our theory of the twofold wish-fulfillment in the dream,\nbut, in his own wording, becomes even more comprehensible for us than\nfor Robert himself. The free indulgence of the psychic in the play of\nits faculties finds expression with us in the non-interference with the\ndream on the part of the foreconscious activity. The \"return to the\nembryonal state of psychic life in the dream\" and the observation of\nHavelock Ellis, \"an archaic world of vast emotions and imperfect\nthoughts,\" appear to us as happy anticipations of our deductions to the\neffect that _primitive_ modes of work suppressed during the day\nparticipate in the formation of the dream; and with us, as with Delage,\nthe _suppressed_ material becomes the mainspring of the dreaming.\nWe have fully recognized the r\u00f4le which Scherner ascribes to the dream\nphantasy, and even his interpretation; but we have been obliged, so to\nspeak, to conduct them to another department in the problem. It is not\nthe dream that produces the phantasy but the unconscious phantasy that\ntakes the greatest part in the formation of the dream thoughts. We are\nindebted to Scherner for his clew to the source of the dream thoughts,\nbut almost everything that he ascribes to the dream-work is attributable\nto the activity of the unconscious, which is at work during the day, and\nwhich supplies incitements not only for dreams but for neurotic symptoms\nas well. We have had to separate the dream-work from this activity as\nbeing something entirely different and far more restricted. Finally, we\nhave by no means abandoned the relation of the dream to mental\ndisturbances, but, on the contrary, we have given it a more solid\nfoundation on new ground.\nThus held together by the new material of our theory as by a superior\nunity, we find the most varied and most contradictory conclusions of the\nauthorities fitting into our structure; some of them are differently\ndisposed, only a few of them are entirely rejected. But our own\nstructure is still unfinished. For, disregarding the many obscurities\nwhich we have necessarily encountered in our advance into the darkness\nof psychology, we are now apparently embarrassed by a new contradiction.\nOn the one hand, we have allowed the dream thoughts to proceed from\nperfectly normal mental operations, while, on the other hand, we have\nfound among the dream thoughts a number of entirely abnormal mental\nprocesses which extend likewise to the dream contents. These,\nconsequently, we have repeated in the interpretation of the dream. All\nthat we have termed the \"dream-work\" seems so remote from the psychic\nprocesses recognized by us as correct, that the severest judgments of\nthe authors as to the low psychic activity of dreaming seem to us well\nfounded.\nPerhaps only through still further advance can enlightenment and\nimprovement be brought about. I shall pick out one of the constellations\nleading to the formation of dreams.\nWe have learned that the dream replaces a number of thoughts derived\nfrom daily life which are perfectly formed logically. We cannot\ntherefore doubt that these thoughts originate from our normal mental\nlife. All the qualities which we esteem in our mental operations, and\nwhich distinguish these as complicated activities of a high order, we\nfind repeated in the dream thoughts. There is, however, no need of\nassuming that this mental work is performed during sleep, as this would\nmaterially impair the conception of the psychic state of sleep we have\nhitherto adhered to. These thoughts may just as well have originated\nfrom the day, and, unnoticed by our consciousness from their inception,\nthey may have continued to develop until they stood complete at the\nonset of sleep. If we are to conclude anything from this state of\naffairs, it will at most prove _that the most complex mental operations\nare possible without the co\u00f6peration of consciousness_, which we have\nalready learned independently from every psychoanalysis of persons\nsuffering from hysteria or obsessions. These dream thoughts are in\nthemselves surely not incapable of consciousness; if they have not\nbecome conscious to us during the day, this may have various reasons.\nThe state of becoming conscious depends on the exercise of a certain\npsychic function, viz. attention, which seems to be extended only in a\ndefinite quantity, and which may have been withdrawn from the stream of\nthought in Question by other aims. Another way in which such mental\nstreams are kept from consciousness is the following:--Our conscious\nreflection teaches us that when exercising attention we pursue a\ndefinite course. But if that course leads us to an idea which does not\nhold its own with the critic, we discontinue and cease to apply our\nattention. Now, apparently, the stream of thought thus started and\nabandoned may spin on without regaining attention unless it reaches a\nspot of especially marked intensity which forces the return of\nattention. An initial rejection, perhaps consciously brought about by\nthe judgment on the ground of incorrectness or unfitness for the actual\npurpose of the mental act, may therefore account for the fact that a\nmental process continues until the onset of sleep unnoticed by\nconsciousness.\nLet us recapitulate by saying that we call such a stream of thought a\nforeconscious one, that we believe it to be perfectly correct, and that\nit may just as well be a more neglected one or an interrupted and\nsuppressed one. Let us also state frankly in what manner we conceive\nthis presentation course. We believe that a certain sum of excitement,\nwhich we call occupation energy, is displaced from an end-presentation\nalong the association paths selected by that end-presentation. A\n\"neglected\" stream of thought has received no such occupation, and from\na \"suppressed\" or \"rejected\" one this occupation has been withdrawn;\nboth have thus been left to their own emotions. The end-stream of\nthought stocked with energy is under certain conditions able to draw to\nitself the attention of consciousness, through which means it then\nreceives a \"surplus of energy.\" We shall be obliged somewhat later to\nelucidate our assumption concerning the nature and activity of\nconsciousness.\nA train of thought thus incited in the Forec. may either disappear\nspontaneously or continue. The former issue we conceive as follows: It\ndiffuses its energy through all the association paths emanating from it,\nand throws the entire chain of ideas into a state of excitement which,\nafter lasting for a while, subsides through the transformation of the\nexcitement requiring an outlet into dormant energy.[1] If this first\nissue is brought about the process has no further significance for the\ndream formation. But other end-presentations are lurking in our\nforeconscious that originate from the sources of our unconscious and\nfrom the ever active wishes. These may take possession of the\nexcitations in the circle of thought thus left to itself, establish a\nconnection between it and the unconscious wish, and transfer to it the\nenergy inherent in the unconscious wish. Henceforth the neglected or\nsuppressed train of thought is in a position to maintain itself,\nalthough this reinforcement does not help it to gain access to\nconsciousness. We may say that the hitherto foreconscious train of\nthought has been drawn into the unconscious.\nOther constellations for the dream formation would result if the\nforeconscious train of thought had from the beginning been connected\nwith the unconscious wish, and for that reason met with rejection by the\ndominating end-occupation; or if an unconscious wish were made active\nfor other--possibly somatic--reasons and of its own accord sought a\ntransference to the psychic remnants not occupied by the Forec. All\nthree cases finally combine in one issue, so that there is established\nin the foreconscious a stream of thought which, having been abandoned by\nthe foreconscious occupation, receives occupation from the unconscious\nwish.\nThe stream of thought is henceforth subjected to a series of\ntransformations which we no longer recognize as normal psychic processes\nand which give us a surprising result, viz. a psychopathological\nformation. Let us emphasize and group the same.\n1. The intensities of the individual ideas become capable of discharge\nin their entirety, and, proceeding from one conception to the other,\nthey thus form single presentations endowed with marked intensity.\nThrough the repeated recurrence of this process the intensity of an\nentire train of ideas may ultimately be gathered in a single\npresentation element. This is the principle of _compression or\ncondensation_. It is condensation that is mainly responsible for the\nstrange impression of the dream, for we know of nothing analogous to it\nin the normal psychic life accessible to consciousness. We find here,\nalso, presentations which possess great psychic significance as\njunctions or as end-results of whole chains of thought; but this\nvalidity does not manifest itself in any character conspicuous enough\nfor internal perception; hence, what has been presented in it does not\nbecome in any way more intensive. In the process of condensation the\nentire psychic connection becomes transformed into the intensity of the\npresentation content. It is the same as in a book where we space or\nprint in heavy type any word upon which particular stress is laid for\nthe understanding of the text. In speech the same word would be\npronounced loudly and deliberately and with emphasis. The first\ncomparison leads us at once to an example taken from the chapter on \"The\nDream-Work\" (trimethylamine in the dream of Irma's injection).\nHistorians of art call our attention to the fact that the most ancient\nhistorical sculptures follow a similar principle in expressing the rank\nof the persons represented by the size of the statue. The king is made\ntwo or three times as large as his retinue or the vanquished enemy. A\npiece of art, however, from the Roman period makes use of more subtle\nmeans to accomplish the same purpose. The figure of the emperor is\nplaced in the center in a firmly erect posture; special care is bestowed\non the proper modelling of his figure; his enemies are seen cowering at\nhis feet; but he is no longer represented a giant among dwarfs. However,\nthe bowing of the subordinate to his superior in our own days is only an\necho of that ancient principle of representation.\nThe direction taken by the condensations of the dream is prescribed on\nthe one hand by the true foreconscious relations of the dream thoughts,\nan the other hand by the attraction of the visual reminiscences in the\nunconscious. The success of the condensation work produces those\nintensities which are required for penetration into the perception\nsystems.\n2. Through this free transferability of the intensities, moreover, and\nin the service of condensation, _intermediary\npresentations_--compromises, as it were--are formed (_cf._ the numerous\nexamples). This, likewise, is something unheard of in the normal\npresentation course, where it is above all a question of selection and\nretention of the \"proper\" presentation element. On the other hand,\ncomposite and compromise formations occur with extraordinary frequency\nwhen we are trying to find the linguistic expression for foreconscious\nthoughts; these are considered \"slips of the tongue.\"\n3. The presentations which transfer their intensities to one another are\n_very loosely connected_, and are joined together by such forms of\nassociation as are spurned in our serious thought and are utilized in\nthe production of the effect of wit only. Among these we particularly\nfind associations of the sound and consonance types.\n4. Contradictory thoughts do not strive to eliminate one another, but\nremain side by side. They often unite to produce condensation _as if no\ncontradiction_ existed, or they form compromises for which we should\nnever forgive our thoughts, but which we frequently approve of in our\nactions.\nThese are some of the most conspicuous abnormal processes to which the\nthoughts which have previously been rationally formed are subjected in\nthe course of the dream-work. As the main feature of these processes we\nrecognize the high importance attached to the fact of rendering the\noccupation energy mobile and capable of discharge; the content and the\nactual significance of the psychic elements, to which these energies\nadhere, become a matter of secondary importance. One might possibly\nthink that the condensation and compromise formation is effected only in\nthe service of regression, when occasion arises for changing thoughts\ninto pictures. But the analysis and--still more distinctly--the\nsynthesis of dreams which lack regression toward pictures, _e.g._ the\ndream \"Autodidasker--Conversation with Court-Councilor N.,\" present the\nsame processes of displacement and condensation as the others.\nHence we cannot refuse to acknowledge that the two kinds of essentially\ndifferent psychic processes participate in the formation of the dream;\none forms perfectly correct dream thoughts which are equivalent to\nnormal thoughts, while the other treats these ideas in a highly\nsurprising and incorrect manner. The latter process we have already set\napart as the dream-work proper. What have we now to advance concerning\nthis latter psychic process?\nWe should be unable to answer this question here if we had not\npenetrated considerably into the psychology of the neuroses and\nespecially of hysteria. From this we learn that the same incorrect\npsychic processes--as well as others that have not been\nenumerated--control the formation of hysterical symptoms. In hysteria,\ntoo, we at once find a series of perfectly correct thoughts equivalent\nto our conscious thoughts, of whose existence, however, in this form we\ncan learn nothing and which we can only subsequently reconstruct. If\nthey have forced their way anywhere to our perception, we discover from\nthe analysis of the symptom formed that these normal thoughts have been\nsubjected to abnormal treatment and _have been transformed into the\nsymptom by means of condensation and compromise formation, through\nsuperficial associations, under cover of contradictions, and eventually\nover the road of regression_. In view of the complete identity found\nbetween the peculiarities of the dream-work and of the psychic activity\nforming the psychoneurotic symptoms, we shall feel justified in\ntransferring to the dream the conclusions urged upon us by hysteria.\nFrom the theory of hysteria we borrow the proposition that _such an\nabnormal psychic elaboration of a normal train of thought takes place\nonly when the latter has been used for the transference of an\nunconscious wish which dates from the infantile life and is in a state\nof repression_. In accordance with this proposition we have construed\nthe theory of the dream on the assumption that the actuating dream-wish\ninvariably originates in the unconscious, which, as we ourselves have\nadmitted, cannot be universally demonstrated though it cannot be\nrefuted. But in order to explain the real meaning of the term\n_repression_, which we have employed so freely, we shall be obliged to\nmake some further addition to our psychological construction.\nWe have above elaborated the fiction of a primitive psychic apparatus,\nwhose work is regulated by the efforts to avoid accumulation of\nexcitement and as far as possible to maintain itself free from\nexcitement. For this reason it was constructed after the plan of a\nreflex apparatus; the motility, originally the path for the inner bodily\nchange, formed a discharging path standing at its disposal. We\nsubsequently discussed the psychic results of a feeling of\ngratification, and we might at the same time have introduced the second\nassumption, viz. that accumulation of excitement--following certain\nmodalities that do not concern us--is perceived as pain and sets the\napparatus in motion in order to reproduce a feeling of gratification in\nwhich the diminution of the excitement is perceived as pleasure. Such a\ncurrent in the apparatus which emanates from pain and strives for\npleasure we call a wish. We have said that nothing but a wish is capable\nof setting the apparatus in motion, and that the discharge of excitement\nin the apparatus is regulated automatically by the perception of\npleasure and pain. The first wish must have been an hallucinatory\noccupation of the memory for gratification. But this hallucination,\nunless it were maintained to the point of exhaustion, proved incapable\nof bringing about a cessation of the desire and consequently of securing\nthe pleasure connected with gratification.\nThus there was required a second activity--in our terminology the\nactivity of a second system--which should not permit the memory\noccupation to advance to perception and therefrom to restrict the\npsychic forces, but should lead the excitement emanating from the\ncraving stimulus by a devious path over the spontaneous motility which\nultimately should so change the outer world as to allow the real\nperception of the object of gratification to take place. Thus far we\nhave elaborated the plan of the psychic apparatus; these two systems are\nthe germ of the Unc. and Forec, which we include in the fully developed\napparatus.\nIn order to be in a position successfully to change the outer world\nthrough the motility, there is required the accumulation of a large sum\nof experiences in the memory systems as well as a manifold fixation of\nthe relations which are evoked in this memory material by different\nend-presentations. We now proceed further with our assumption. The\nmanifold activity of the second system, tentatively sending forth and\nretracting energy, must on the one hand have full command over all\nmemory material, but on the other hand it would be a superfluous\nexpenditure for it to send to the individual mental paths large\nquantities of energy which would thus flow off to no purpose,\ndiminishing the quantity available for the transformation of the outer\nworld. In the interests of expediency I therefore postulate that the\nsecond system succeeds in maintaining the greater part of the occupation\nenergy in a dormant state and in using but a small portion for the\npurposes of displacement. The mechanism of these processes is entirely\nunknown to me; any one who wishes to follow up these ideas must try to\nfind the physical analogies and prepare the way for a demonstration of\nthe process of motion in the stimulation of the neuron. I merely hold to\nthe idea that the activity of the first [Greek: Psi]-system is directed\n_to the free outflow of the quantities of excitement_, and that the\nsecond system brings about an inhibition of this outflow through the\nenergies emanating from it, _i.e._ it produces a _transformation into\ndormant energy, probably by raising the level_. I therefore assume that\nunder the control of the second system as compared with the first, the\ncourse of the excitement is bound to entirely different mechanical\nconditions. After the second system has finished its tentative mental\nwork, it removes the inhibition and congestion of the excitements and\nallows these excitements to flow off to the motility.\nAn interesting train of thought now presents itself if we consider the\nrelations of this inhibition of discharge by the second system to the\nregulation through the principle of pain. Let us now seek the\ncounterpart of the primary feeling of gratification, namely, the\nobjective feeling of fear. A perceptive stimulus acts on the primitive\napparatus, becoming the source of a painful emotion. This will then be\nfollowed by irregular motor manifestations until one of these withdraws\nthe apparatus from perception and at the same time from pain, but on the\nreappearance of the perception this manifestation will immediately\nrepeat itself (perhaps as a movement of flight) until the perception has\nagain disappeared. But there will here remain no tendency again to\noccupy the perception of the source of pain in the form of an\nhallucination or in any other form. On the contrary, there will be a\ntendency in the primary apparatus to abandon the painful memory picture\nas soon as it is in any way awakened, as the overflow of its excitement\nwould surely produce (more precisely, begin to produce) pain. The\ndeviation from memory, which is but a repetition of the former flight\nfrom perception, is facilitated also by the fact that, unlike\nperception, memory does not possess sufficient quality to excite\nconsciousness and thereby to attract to itself new energy. This easy and\nregularly occurring deviation of the psychic process from the former\npainful memory presents to us the model and the first example of\n_psychic repression_. As is generally known, much of this deviation from\nthe painful, much of the behavior of the ostrich, can be readily\ndemonstrated even in the normal psychic life of adults.\nBy virtue of the principle of pain the first system is therefore\naltogether incapable of introducing anything unpleasant into the mental\nassociations. The system cannot do anything but wish. If this remained\nso the mental activity of the second system, which should have at its\ndisposal all the memories stored up by experiences, would be hindered.\nBut two ways are now opened: the work of the second system either frees\nitself completely from the principle of pain and continues its course,\npaying no heed to the painful reminiscence, or it contrives to occupy\nthe painful memory in such a manner as to preclude the liberation of\npain. We may reject the first possibility, as the principle of pain also\nmanifests itself as a regulator for the emotional discharge of the\nsecond system; we are, therefore, directed to the second possibility,\nnamely, that this system occupies a reminiscence in such a manner as to\ninhibit its discharge and hence, also, to inhibit the discharge\ncomparable to a motor innervation for the development of pain. Thus from\ntwo starting points we are led to the hypothesis that occupation through\nthe second system is at the same time an inhibition for the emotional\ndischarge, viz. from a consideration of the principle of pain and from\nthe principle of the smallest expenditure of innervation. Let us,\nhowever, keep to the fact--this is the key to the theory of\nrepression--that the second system is capable of occupying an idea only\nwhen it is in position to check the development of pain emanating from\nit. Whatever withdraws itself from this inhibition also remains\ninaccessible for the second system and would soon be abandoned by virtue\nof the principle of pain. The inhibition of pain, however, need not be\ncomplete; it must be permitted to begin, as it indicates to the second\nsystem the nature of the memory and possibly its defective adaptation\nfor the purpose sought by the mind.\nThe psychic process which is admitted by the first system only I shall\nnow call the _primary_ process; and the one resulting from the\ninhibition of the second system I shall call the _secondary_ process. I\nshow by another point for what purpose the second system is obliged to\ncorrect the primary process. The primary process strives for a discharge\nof the excitement in order to establish a _perception_ identity with the\nsum of excitement thus gathered; the secondary process has abandoned\nthis intention and undertaken instead the task of bringing about a\n_thought identity_. All thinking is only a circuitous path from the\nmemory of gratification taken as an end-presentation to the identical\noccupation of the same memory, which is again to be attained on the\ntrack of the motor experiences. The state of thinking must take an\ninterest in the connecting paths between the presentations without\nallowing itself to be misled by their intensities. But it is obvious\nthat condensations and intermediate or compromise formations occurring\nin the presentations impede the attainment of this end-identity; by\nsubstituting one idea for the other they deviate from the path which\notherwise would have been continued from the original idea. Such\nprocesses are therefore carefully avoided in the secondary thinking. Nor\nis it difficult to understand that the principle of pain also impedes\nthe progress of the mental stream in its pursuit of the thought\nidentity, though, indeed, it offers to the mental stream the most\nimportant points of departure. Hence the tendency of the thinking\nprocess must be to free itself more and more from exclusive adjustment\nby the principle of pain, and through the working of the mind to\nrestrict the affective development to that minimum which is necessary as\na signal. This refinement of the activity must have been attained\nthrough a recent over-occupation of energy brought about by\nconsciousness. But we are aware that this refinement is seldom\ncompletely successful even in the most normal psychic life and that our\nthoughts ever remain accessible to falsification through the\ninterference of the principle of pain.\nThis, however, is not the breach in the functional efficiency of our\npsychic apparatus through which the thoughts forming the material of the\nsecondary mental work are enabled to make their way into the primary\npsychic process--with which formula we may now describe the work leading\nto the dream and to the hysterical symptoms. This case of insufficiency\nresults from the union of the two factors from the history of our\nevolution; one of which belongs solely to the psychic apparatus and has\nexerted a determining influence on the relation of the two systems,\nwhile the other operates fluctuatingly and introduces motive forces of\norganic origin into the psychic life. Both originate in the infantile\nlife and result from the transformation which our psychic and somatic\norganism has undergone since the infantile period.\nWhen I termed one of the psychic processes in the psychic apparatus the\nprimary process, I did so not only in consideration of the order of\nprecedence and capability, but also as admitting the temporal relations\nto a share in the nomenclature. As far as our knowledge goes there is no\npsychic apparatus possessing only the primary process, and in so far it\nis a theoretic fiction; but so much is based on fact that the primary\nprocesses are present in the apparatus from the beginning, while the\nsecondary processes develop gradually in the course of life, inhibiting\nand covering the primary ones, and gaining complete mastery over them\nperhaps only at the height of life. Owing to this retarded appearance of\nthe secondary processes, the essence of our being, consisting in\nunconscious wish feelings, can neither be seized nor inhibited by the\nforeconscious, whose part is once for all restricted to the indication\nof the most suitable paths for the wish feelings originating in the\nunconscious. These unconscious wishes establish for all subsequent\npsychic efforts a compulsion to which they have to submit and which\nthey must strive if possible to divert from its course and direct to\nhigher aims. In consequence of this retardation of the foreconscious\noccupation a large sphere of the memory material remains inaccessible.\nAmong these indestructible and unincumbered wish feelings originating\nfrom the infantile life, there are also some, the fulfillments of which\nhave entered into a relation of contradiction to the end-presentation of\nthe secondary thinking. The fulfillment of these wishes would no longer\nproduce an affect of pleasure but one of pain; _and it is just this\ntransformation of affect that constitutes the nature of what we\ndesignate as \"repression,\" in which we recognize the infantile first\nstep of passing adverse sentence or of rejecting through reason_. To\ninvestigate in what way and through what motive forces such a\ntransformation can be produced constitutes the problem of repression,\nwhich we need here only skim over. It will suffice to remark that such a\ntransformation of affect occurs in the course of development (one may\nthink of the appearance in infantile life of disgust which was\noriginally absent), and that it is connected with the activity of the\nsecondary system. The memories from which the unconscious wish brings\nabout the emotional discharge have never been accessible to the Forec.,\nand for that reason their emotional discharge cannot be inhibited. It\nis just on account of this affective development that these ideas are\nnot even now accessible to the foreconscious thoughts to which they have\ntransferred their wishing power. On the contrary, the principle of pain\ncomes into play, and causes the Forec. to deviate from these thoughts of\ntransference. The latter, left to themselves, are \"repressed,\" and thus\nthe existence of a store of infantile memories, from the very beginning\nwithdrawn from the Forec., becomes the preliminary condition of\nrepression.\nIn the most favorable case the development of pain terminates as soon as\nthe energy has been withdrawn from the thoughts of transference in the\nForec., and this effect characterizes the intervention of the principle\nof pain as expedient. It is different, however, if the repressed\nunconscious wish receives an organic enforcement which it can lend to\nits thoughts of transference and through which it can enable them to\nmake an effort towards penetration with their excitement, even after\nthey have been abandoned by the occupation of the Forec. A defensive\nstruggle then ensues, inasmuch as the Forec. reinforces the antagonism\nagainst the repressed ideas, and subsequently this leads to a\npenetration by the thoughts of transference (the carriers of the\nunconscious wish) in some form of compromise through symptom formation.\nBut from the moment that the suppressed thoughts are powerfully occupied\nby the unconscious wish-feeling and abandoned by the foreconscious\noccupation, they succumb to the primary psychic process and strive only\nfor motor discharge; or, if the path be free, for hallucinatory revival\nof the desired perception identity. We have previously found,\nempirically, that the incorrect processes described are enacted only\nwith thoughts that exist in the repression. We now grasp another part of\nthe connection. These incorrect processes are those that are primary in\nthe psychic apparatus; _they appear wherever thoughts abandoned by the\nforeconscious occupation are left to themselves, and can fill themselves\nwith the uninhibited energy, striving for discharge from the\nunconscious_. We may add a few further observations to support the view\nthat these processes designated \"incorrect\" are really not\nfalsifications of the normal defective thinking, but the modes of\nactivity of the psychic apparatus when freed from inhibition. Thus we\nsee that the transference of the foreconscious excitement to the\nmotility takes place according to the same processes, and that the\nconnection of the foreconscious presentations with words readily\nmanifest the same displacements and mixtures which are ascribed to\ninattention. Finally, I should like to adduce proof that an increase of\nwork necessarily results from the inhibition of these primary courses\nfrom the fact that we gain a _comical effect_, a surplus to be\ndischarged through laughter, _if we allow these streams of thought to\ncome to consciousness_.\nThe theory of the psychoneuroses asserts with complete certainty that\nonly sexual wish-feelings from the infantile life experience repression\n(emotional transformation) during the developmental period of childhood.\nThese are capable of returning to activity at a later period of\ndevelopment, and then have the faculty of being revived, either as a\nconsequence of the sexual constitution, which is really formed from the\noriginal bisexuality, or in consequence of unfavorable influences of the\nsexual life; and they thus supply the motive power for all\npsychoneurotic symptom formations. It is only by the introduction of\nthese sexual forces that the gaps still demonstrable in the theory of\nrepression can be filled. I will leave it undecided whether the\npostulate of the sexual and infantile may also be asserted for the\ntheory of the dream; I leave this here unfinished because I have already\npassed a step beyond the demonstrable in assuming that the dream-wish\ninvariably originates from the unconscious.[2] Nor will I further\ninvestigate the difference in the play of the psychic forces in the\ndream formation and in the formation of the hysterical symptoms, for to\ndo this we ought to possess a more explicit knowledge of one of the\nmembers to be compared. But I regard another point as important, and\nwill here confess that it was on account of this very point that I have\njust undertaken this entire discussion concerning the two psychic\nsystems, their modes of operation, and the repression. For it is now\nimmaterial whether I have conceived the psychological relations in\nquestion with approximate correctness, or, as is easily possible in such\na difficult matter, in an erroneous and fragmentary manner. Whatever\nchanges may be made in the interpretation of the psychic censor and of\nthe correct and of the abnormal elaboration of the dream content, the\nfact nevertheless remains that such processes are active in dream\nformation, and that essentially they show the closest analogy to the\nprocesses observed in the formation of the hysterical symptoms. The\ndream is not a pathological phenomenon, and it does not leave behind an\nenfeeblement of the mental faculties. The objection that no deduction\ncan be drawn regarding the dreams of healthy persons from my own dreams\nand from those of neurotic patients may be rejected without comment.\nHence, when we draw conclusions from the phenomena as to their motive\nforces, we recognize that the psychic mechanism made use of by the\nneuroses is not created by a morbid disturbance of the psychic life, but\nis found ready in the normal structure of the psychic apparatus. The two\npsychic systems, the censor crossing between them, the inhibition and\nthe covering of the one activity by the other, the relations of both to\nconsciousness--or whatever may offer a more correct interpretation of\nthe actual conditions in their stead--all these belong to the normal\nstructure of our psychic instrument, and the dream points out for us one\nof the roads leading to a knowledge of this structure. If, in addition\nto our knowledge, we wish to be contented with a minimum perfectly\nestablished, we shall say that the dream gives us proof that the\n_suppressed, material continues to exist even in the normal person and\nremains capable of psychic activity_. The dream itself is one of the\nmanifestations of this suppressed material; theoretically, this is true\nin _all_ cases; according to substantial experience it is true in at\nleast a great number of such as most conspicuously display the prominent\ncharacteristics of dream life. The suppressed psychic material, which in\nthe waking state has been prevented from expression and cut off from\ninternal perception _by the antagonistic adjustment of the\ncontradictions_, finds ways and means of obtruding itself on\nconsciousness during the night under the domination of the compromise\nformations.\n_\"Flectere si nequeo superos, Acheronta movebo.\"_\nAt any rate the interpretation of dreams is the _via regia_ to a\nknowledge of the unconscious in the psychic life.\nIn following the analysis of the dream we have made some progress toward\nan understanding of the composition of this most marvelous and most\nmysterious of instruments; to be sure, we have not gone very far, but\nenough of a beginning has been made to allow us to advance from other\nso-called pathological formations further into the analysis of the\nunconscious. Disease--at least that which is justly termed\nfunctional--is not due to the destruction of this apparatus, and the\nestablishment of new splittings in its interior; it is rather to be\nexplained dynamically through the strengthening and weakening of the\ncomponents in the play of forces by which so many activities are\nconcealed during the normal function. We have been able to show in\nanother place how the composition of the apparatus from the two systems\npermits a subtilization even of the normal activity which would be\nimpossible for a single system.\n[1] _Cf._ the significant observations by J. Bueuer in our _Studies on\nHysteria_, 1895, and 2nd ed. 1909.\n[2] Here, as in other places, there are gaps in the treatment of the\nsubject, which I have left intentionally, because to fill them up would\nrequire on the one hand too great effort, and on the other hand an\nextensive reference to material that is foreign to the dream. Thus I\nhave avoided stating whether I connect with the word \"suppressed\"\nanother sense than with the word \"repressed.\" It has been made clear\nonly that the latter emphasizes more than the former the relation to the\nunconscious. I have not entered into the cognate problem why the dream\nthoughts also experience distortion by the censor when they abandon the\nprogressive continuation to consciousness and choose the path of\nregression. I have been above all anxious to awaken an interest in the\nproblems to which the further analysis of the dreamwork leads and to\nindicate the other themes which meet these on the way. It was not always\neasy to decide just where the pursuit should be discontinued. That I\nhave not treated exhaustively the part played in the dream by the\npsychosexual life and have avoided the interpretation of dreams of an\nobvious sexual content is due to a special reason which may not come up\nto the reader's expectation. To be sure, it is very far from my ideas\nand the principles expressed by me in neuropathology to regard the\nsexual life as a \"pudendum\" which should be left unconsidered by the\nphysician and the scientific investigator. I also consider ludicrous the\nmoral indignation which prompted the translator of Artemidoros of Daldis\nto keep from the reader's knowledge the chapter on sexual dreams\ncontained in the _Symbolism of the Dreams_. As for myself, I have been\nactuated solely by the conviction that in the explanation of sexual\ndreams I should be bound to entangle myself deeply in the still\nunexplained problems of perversion and bisexuality; and for that reason\nI have reserved this material for another connection.\nIX\nTHE UNCONSCIOUS AND CONSCIOUSNESS--REALITY\nOn closer inspection we find that it is not the existence of two systems\nnear the motor end of the apparatus but of two kinds of processes or\nmodes of emotional discharge, the assumption of which was explained in\nthe psychological discussions of the previous chapter. This can make no\ndifference for us, for we must always be ready to drop our auxiliary\nideas whenever we deem ourselves in position to replace them by\nsomething else approaching more closely to the unknown reality. Let us\nnow try to correct some views which might be erroneously formed as long\nas we regarded the two systems in the crudest and most obvious sense as\ntwo localities within the psychic apparatus, views which have left their\ntraces in the terms \"repression\" and \"penetration.\" Thus, when we say\nthat an unconscious idea strives for transference into the foreconscious\nin order later to penetrate consciousness, we do not mean that a second\nidea is to be formed situated in a new locality like an interlineation\nnear which the original continues to remain; also, when we speak of\npenetration into consciousness, we wish carefully to avoid any idea of\nchange of locality. When we say that a foreconscious idea is repressed\nand subsequently taken up by the unconscious, we might be tempted by\nthese figures, borrowed from the idea of a struggle over a territory, to\nassume that an arrangement is really broken up in one psychic locality\nand replaced by a new one in the other locality. For these comparisons\nwe substitute what would seem to correspond better with the real state\nof affairs by saying that an energy occupation is displaced to or\nwithdrawn from a certain arrangement so that the psychic formation falls\nunder the domination of a system or is withdrawn from the same. Here\nagain we replace a topical mode of presentation by a dynamic; it is not\nthe psychic formation that appears to us as the moving factor but the\ninnervation of the same.\nI deem it appropriate and justifiable, however, to apply ourselves still\nfurther to the illustrative conception of the two systems. We shall\navoid any misapplication of this manner of representation if we remember\nthat presentations, thoughts, and psychic formations should generally\nnot be localized in the organic elements of the nervous system, but, so\nto speak, between them, where resistances and paths form the correlate\ncorresponding to them. Everything that can become an object of our\ninternal perception is virtual, like the image in the telescope produced\nby the passage of the rays of light. But we are justified in assuming\nthe existence of the systems, which have nothing psychic in themselves\nand which never become accessible to our psychic perception,\ncorresponding to the lenses of the telescope which design the image. If\nwe continue this comparison, we may say that the censor between two\nsystems corresponds to the refraction of rays during their passage into\na new medium.\nThus far we have made psychology on our own responsibility; it is now\ntime to examine the theoretical opinions governing present-day\npsychology and to test their relation to our theories. The question of\nthe unconscious, in psychology is, according to the authoritative words\nof Lipps, less a psychological question than the question of psychology.\nAs long as psychology settled this question with the verbal explanation\nthat the \"psychic\" is the \"conscious\" and that \"unconscious psychic\noccurrences\" are an obvious contradiction, a psychological estimate of\nthe observations gained by the physician from abnormal mental states was\nprecluded. The physician and the philosopher agree only when both\nacknowledge that unconscious psychic processes are \"the appropriate and\nwell-justified expression for an established fact.\" The physician cannot\nbut reject with a shrug of his shoulders the assertion that\n\"consciousness is the indispensable quality of the psychic\"; he may\nassume, if his respect for the utterings of the philosophers still be\nstrong enough, that he and they do not treat the same subject and do not\npursue the same science. For a single intelligent observation of the\npsychic life of a neurotic, a single analysis of a dream must force upon\nhim the unalterable conviction that the most complicated and correct\nmental operations, to which no one will refuse the name of psychic\noccurrences, may take place without exciting the consciousness of the\nperson. It is true that the physician does not learn of these\nunconscious processes until they have exerted such an effect on\nconsciousness as to admit communication or observation. But this effect\nof consciousness may show a psychic character widely differing from the\nunconscious process, so that the internal perception cannot possibly\nrecognize the one as a substitute for the other. The physician must\nreserve for himself the right to penetrate, by a process of deduction,\nfrom the effect on consciousness to the unconscious psychic process; he\nlearns in this way that the effect on consciousness is only a remote\npsychic product of the unconscious process and that the latter has not\nbecome conscious as such; that it has been in existence and operative\nwithout betraying itself in any way to consciousness.\nA reaction from the over-estimation of the quality of consciousness\nbecomes the indispensable preliminary condition for any correct insight\ninto the behavior of the psychic. In the words of Lipps, the unconscious\nmust be accepted as the general basis of the psychic life. The\nunconscious is the larger circle which includes within itself the\nsmaller circle of the conscious; everything conscious has its\npreliminary step in the unconscious, whereas the unconscious may stop\nwith this step and still claim full value as a psychic activity.\nProperly speaking, the unconscious is the real psychic; _its inner\nnature is just as unknown to us as the reality of the external world,\nand it is just as imperfectly reported to us through the data of\nconsciousness as is the external world through the indications of our\nsensory organs_.\nA series of dream problems which have intensely occupied older authors\nwill be laid aside when the old opposition between conscious life and\ndream life is abandoned and the unconscious psychic assigned to its\nproper place. Thus many of the activities whose performances in the\ndream have excited our admiration are now no longer to be attributed to\nthe dream but to unconscious thinking, which is also active during the\nday. If, according to Scherner, the dream seems to play with a symboling\nrepresentation of the body, we know that this is the work of certain\nunconscious phantasies which have probably given in to sexual emotions,\nand that these phantasies come to expression not only in dreams but also\nin hysterical phobias and in other symptoms. If the dream continues and\nsettles activities of the day and even brings to light valuable\ninspirations, we have only to subtract from it the dream disguise as a\nfeat of dream-work and a mark of assistance from obscure forces in the\ndepth of the mind (_cf._ the devil in Tartini's sonata dream). The\nintellectual task as such must be attributed to the same psychic forces\nwhich perform all such tasks during the day. We are probably far too\nmuch inclined to over-estimate the conscious character even of\nintellectual and artistic productions. From the communications of some\nof the most highly productive persons, such as Goethe and Helmholtz, we\nlearn, indeed, that the most essential and original parts in their\ncreations came to them in the form of inspirations and reached their\nperceptions almost finished. There is nothing strange about the\nassistance of the conscious activity in other cases where there was a\nconcerted effort of all the psychic forces. But it is a much abused\nprivilege of the conscious activity that it is allowed to hide from us\nall other activities wherever it participates.\nIt will hardly be worth while to take up the historical significance of\ndreams as a special subject. Where, for instance, a chieftain has been\nurged through a dream to engage in a bold undertaking the success of\nwhich has had the effect of changing history, a new problem results only\nso long as the dream, regarded as a strange power, is contrasted with\nother more familiar psychic forces; the problem, however, disappears\nwhen we regard the dream as a form of expression for feelings which are\nburdened with resistance during the day and which can receive\nreinforcements at night from deep emotional sources. But the great\nrespect shown by the ancients for the dream is based on a correct\npsychological surmise. It is a homage paid to the unsubdued and\nindestructible in the human mind, and to the demoniacal which furnishes\nthe dream-wish and which we find again in our unconscious.\nNot inadvisedly do I use the expression \"in our unconscious,\" for what\nwe so designate does not coincide with the unconscious of the\nphilosophers, nor with the unconscious of Lipps. In the latter uses it\nis intended to designate only the opposite of conscious. That there are\nalso unconscious psychic processes beside the conscious ones is the\nhotly contested and energetically defended issue. Lipps gives us the\nmore far-reaching theory that everything psychic exists as unconscious,\nbut that some of it may exist also as conscious. But it was not to prove\nthis theory that we have adduced the phenomena of the dream and of the\nhysterical symptom formation; the observation of normal life alone\nsuffices to establish its correctness beyond any doubt. The new fact\nthat we have learned from the analysis of the psychopathological\nformations, and indeed from their first member, viz. dreams, is that the\nunconscious--hence the psychic--occurs as a function of two separate\nsystems and that it occurs as such even in normal psychic life.\nConsequently there are two kinds of unconscious, which we do not as yet\nfind distinguished by the psychologists. Both are unconscious in the\npsychological sense; but in our sense the first, which we call Unc., is\nlikewise incapable of consciousness, whereas the second we term \"Forec.\"\nbecause its emotions, after the observance of certain rules, can reach\nconsciousness, perhaps not before they have again undergone censorship,\nbut still regardless of the Unc. system. The fact that in order to\nattain consciousness the emotions must traverse an unalterable series of\nevents or succession of instances, as is betrayed through their\nalteration by the censor, has helped us to draw a comparison from\nspatiality. We described the relations of the two systems to each other\nand to consciousness by saying that the system Forec. is like a screen\nbetween the system Unc. and consciousness. The system Forec. not only\nbars access to consciousness, but also controls the entrance to\nvoluntary motility and is capable of sending out a sum of mobile energy,\na portion of which is familiar to us as attention.\nWe must also steer clear of the distinctions superconscious and\nsubconscious which have found so much favor in the more recent\nliterature on the psychoneuroses, for just such a distinction seems to\nemphasize the equivalence of the psychic and the conscious.\nWhat part now remains in our description of the once all-powerful and\nall-overshadowing consciousness? None other than that of a sensory organ\nfor the perception of psychic qualities. According to the fundamental\nidea of schematic undertaking we can conceive the conscious perception\nonly as the particular activity of an independent system for which the\nabbreviated designation \"Cons.\" commends itself. This system we conceive\nto be similar in its mechanical characteristics to the perception system\nP, hence excitable by qualities and incapable of retaining the trace of\nchanges, _i.e._ it is devoid of memory. The psychic apparatus which,\nwith the sensory organs of the P-system, is turned to the outer world,\nis itself the outer world for the sensory organ of Cons.; the\nteleological justification of which rests on this relationship. We are\nhere once more confronted with the principle of the succession of\ninstances which seems to dominate the structure of the apparatus. The\nmaterial under excitement flows to the Cons, sensory organ from two\nsides, firstly from the P-system whose excitement, qualitatively\ndetermined, probably experiences a new elaboration until it comes to\nconscious perception; and, secondly, from the interior of the apparatus\nitself, the quantitative processes of which are perceived as a\nqualitative series of pleasure and pain as soon as they have undergone\ncertain changes.\nThe philosophers, who have learned that correct and highly complicated\nthought structures are possible even without the co\u00f6peration of\nconsciousness, have found it difficult to attribute any function to\nconsciousness; it has appeared to them a superfluous mirroring of the\nperfected psychic process. The analogy of our Cons. system with the\nsystems of perception relieves us of this embarrassment. We see that\nperception through our sensory organs results in directing the\noccupation of attention to those paths on which the incoming sensory\nexcitement is diffused; the qualitative excitement of the P-system\nserves the mobile quantity of the psychic apparatus as a regulator for\nits discharge. We may claim the same function for the overlying sensory\norgan of the Cons. system. By assuming new qualities, it furnishes a new\ncontribution toward the guidance and suitable distribution of the mobile\noccupation quantities. By means of the perceptions of pleasure and pain,\nit influences the course of the occupations within the psychic\napparatus, which normally operates unconsciously and through the\ndisplacement of quantities. It is probable that the principle of pain\nfirst regulates the displacements of occupation automatically, but it is\nquite possible that the consciousness of these qualities adds a second\nand more subtle regulation which may even oppose the first and perfect\nthe working capacity of the apparatus by placing it in a position\ncontrary to its original design for occupying and developing even that\nwhich is connected with the liberation of pain. We learn from\nneuropsychology that an important part in the functional activity of the\napparatus is attributed to such regulations through the qualitative\nexcitation of the sensory organs. The automatic control of the primary\nprinciple of pain and the restriction of mental capacity connected with\nit are broken by the sensible regulations, which in their turn are again\nautomatisms. We learn that the repression which, though originally\nexpedient, terminates nevertheless in a harmful rejection of inhibition\nand of psychic domination, is so much more easily accomplished with\nreminiscences than with perceptions, because in the former there is no\nincrease in occupation through the excitement of the psychic sensory\norgans. When an idea to be rejected has once failed to become conscious\nbecause it has succumbed to repression, it can be repressed on other\noccasions only because it has been withdrawn from conscious perception\non other grounds. These are hints employed by therapy in order to bring\nabout a retrogression of accomplished repressions.\nThe value of the over-occupation which is produced by the regulating\ninfluence of the Cons. sensory organ on the mobile quantity, is\ndemonstrated in the teleological connection by nothing more clearly than\nby the creation of a new series of qualities and consequently a new\nregulation which constitutes the precedence of man over the animals. For\nthe mental processes are in themselves devoid of quality except for the\nexcitements of pleasure and pain accompanying them, which, as we know,\nare to be held in check as possible disturbances of thought. In order to\nendow them with a quality, they are associated in man with verbal\nmemories, the qualitative remnants of which suffice to draw upon them\nthe attention of consciousness which in turn endows thought with a new\nmobile energy.\nThe manifold problems of consciousness in their entirety can be examined\nonly through an analysis of the hysterical mental process. From this\nanalysis we receive the impression that the transition from the\nforeconscious to the occupation of consciousness is also connected with\na censorship similar to the one between the Unc. and the Forec. This\ncensorship, too, begins to act only with the reaching of a certain\nquantitative degree, so that few intense thought formations escape it.\nEvery possible case of detention from consciousness, as well as of\npenetration to consciousness, under restriction is found included within\nthe picture of the psychoneurotic phenomena; every case points to the\nintimate and twofold connection between the censor and consciousness. I\nshall conclude these psychological discussions with the report of two\nsuch occurrences.\nOn the occasion of a consultation a few years ago the subject was an\nintelligent and innocent-looking girl. Her attire was strange; whereas a\nwoman's garb is usually groomed to the last fold, she had one of her\nstockings hanging down and two of her waist buttons opened. She\ncomplained of pains in one of her legs, and exposed her leg unrequested.\nHer chief complaint, however, was in her own words as follows: She had a\nfeeling in her body as if something was stuck into it which moved to and\nfro and made her tremble through and through. This sometimes made her\nwhole body stiff. On hearing this, my colleague in consultation looked\nat me; the complaint was quite plain to him. To both of us it seemed\npeculiar that the patient's mother thought nothing of the matter; of\ncourse she herself must have been repeatedly in the situation described\nby her child. As for the girl, she had no idea of the import of her\nwords or she would never have allowed them to pass her lips. Here the\ncensor had been deceived so successfully that under the mask of an\ninnocent complaint a phantasy was admitted to consciousness which\notherwise would have remained in the foreconscious.\nAnother example: I began the psychoanalytic treatment of a boy of\nfourteen years who was suffering from _tic convulsif_, hysterical\nvomiting, headache, &c., by assuring him that, after closing his eyes,\nhe would see pictures or have ideas, which I requested him to\ncommunicate to me. He answered by describing pictures. The last\nimpression he had received before coming to me was visually revived in\nhis memory. He had played a game of checkers with his uncle, and now saw\nthe checkerboard before him. He commented on various positions that were\nfavorable or unfavorable, on moves that were not safe to make. He then\nsaw a dagger lying on the checker-board, an object belonging to his\nfather, but transferred to the checker-board by his phantasy. Then a\nsickle was lying on the board; next a scythe was added; and, finally, he\nbeheld the likeness of an old peasant mowing the grass in front of the\nboy's distant parental home. A few days later I discovered the meaning\nof this series of pictures. Disagreeable family relations had made the\nboy nervous. It was the case of a strict and crabbed father who lived\nunhappily with his mother, and whose educational methods consisted in\nthreats; of the separation of his father from his tender and delicate\nmother, and the remarrying of his father, who one day brought home a\nyoung woman as his new mamma. The illness of the fourteen-year-old boy\nbroke out a few days later. It was the suppressed anger against his\nfather that had composed these pictures into intelligible allusions. The\nmaterial was furnished by a reminiscence from mythology, The sickle was\nthe one with which Zeus castrated his father; the scythe and the\nlikeness of the peasant represented Kronos, the violent old man who eats\nhis children and upon whom Zeus wreaks vengeance in so unfilial a\nmanner. The marriage of the father gave the boy an opportunity to return\nthe reproaches and threats of his father--which had previously been made\nbecause the child played with his genitals (the checkerboard; the\nprohibitive moves; the dagger with which a person may be killed). We\nhave here long repressed memories and their unconscious remnants which,\nunder the guise of senseless pictures have slipped into consciousness by\ndevious paths left open to them.\nI should then expect to find the theoretical value of the study of\ndreams in its contribution to psychological knowledge and in its\npreparation for an understanding of neuroses. Who can foresee the\nimportance of a thorough knowledge of the structure and activities of\nthe psychic apparatus when even our present state of knowledge produces\na happy therapeutic influence in the curable forms of the\npsychoneuroses? What about the practical value of such study some one\nmay ask, for psychic knowledge and for the discovering of the secret\npeculiarities of individual character? Have not the unconscious feelings\nrevealed by the dream the value of real forces in the psychic life?\nShould we take lightly the ethical significance of the suppressed wishes\nwhich, as they now create dreams, may some day create other things?\nI do not feel justified in answering these questions. I have not thought\nfurther upon this side of the dream problem. I believe, however, that at\nall events the Roman Emperor was in the wrong who ordered one of his\nsubjects executed because the latter dreamt that he had killed the\nEmperor. He should first have endeavored to discover the significance of\nthe dream; most probably it was not what it seemed to be. And even if a\ndream of different content had the significance of this offense against\nmajesty, it would still have been in place to remember the words of\nPlato, that the virtuous man contents himself with dreaming that which\nthe wicked man does in actual life. I am therefore of the opinion that\nit is best to accord freedom to dreams. Whether any reality is to be\nattributed to the unconscious wishes, and in what sense, I am not\nprepared to say offhand. Reality must naturally be denied to all\ntransition--and intermediate thoughts. If we had before us the\nunconscious wishes, brought to their last and truest expression, we\nshould still do well to remember that more than one single form of\nexistence must be ascribed to the psychic reality. Action and the\nconscious expression of thought mostly suffice for the practical need\nof judging a man's character. Action, above all, merits to be placed in\nthe first rank; for many of the impulses penetrating consciousness are\nneutralized by real forces of the psychic life before they are converted\ninto action; indeed, the reason why they frequently do not encounter any\npsychic obstacle on their way is because the unconscious is certain of\ntheir meeting with resistances later. In any case it is instructive to\nbecome familiar with the much raked-up soil from which our virtues\nproudly arise. For the complication of human character moving\ndynamically in all directions very rarely accommodates itself to\nadjustment through a simple alternative, as our antiquated moral\nphilosophy would have it.\nAnd how about the value of the dream for a knowledge of the future?\nThat, of course, we cannot consider. One feels inclined to substitute:\n\"for a knowledge of the past.\" For the dream originates from the past in\nevery sense. To be sure the ancient belief that the dream reveals the\nfuture is not entirely devoid of truth. By representing to us a wish as\nfulfilled the dream certainly leads us into the future; but this future,\ntaken by the dreamer as present, has been formed into the likeness of\nthat past by the indestructible wish.", "source": "dream_psychology.txt"}

Post-Graduate Medical\nSchool; Lecturer in Psychoanalysis and Abnormal\nPsychology, New York University;\nformer Chief of Clinic of Psychiatry,\nColumbia University\n[Illustration: colophon]\nLONDON\nGEORGE ROUTLEDGE & SONS, LIMITED\n1919\n_Printed in Great Britain\nby_ Butler & Tanner.\n_Frome and London_\nAUTHOR\u2019S PREFACE\nThe essays treated here appeared under the subtitle of this book in the\nfirst numbers of the periodical _Imago_ edited by me. They represent my\nfirst efforts to apply view-points and results of psychoanalysis to\nunexplained problems of racial psychology. In method this book contrasts\nwith that of W. Wundt and the works of the Zurich Psychoanalytic School.\nThe former tries to accomplish the same object through assumptions and\nprocedures from non-analytic psychology, while the latter follow the\nopposite course and strive to settle problems of individual psychology\nby referring to material of racial psychology[1]. I am pleased to say\nthat the first stimulus for my own works came from these two sources.\nI am fully aware of the shortcomings in these essays. I shall not touch\nupon those which are characteristic of first efforts at investigation.\nThe others, however, demand a word of explanation. The four essays\nwhich are here collected will be of interest to a wide circle of\neducated people, but they can only be thoroughly understood and judged\nby those who are really acquainted with psychoanalysis as such. It is\nhoped that they may serve as a bond between students of ethnology,\nphilology, folklore and of the allied sciences, and psychoanalysts; they\ncannot, however, supply both groups the entire requisites for such\nco-operation. They will not furnish the former with sufficient insight\ninto the new psychological technique, nor will the psychoanalysts\nacquire through them an adequate command over the material to be\nelaborated. Both groups will have to content themselves with whatever\nattention they can stimulate here and there and with the hope that\nfrequent meetings between them will not remain unproductive for science.\nThe two principal themes, totem and taboo, which give the name to this\nsmall book are not treated alike here. The problem of taboo is presented\nmore exhaustively, and the effort to solve it is approached with perfect\nconfidence. The investigation of totemism may be modestly expressed as:\n\u201cThis is all that psychoanalytic study can contribute at present to the\nelucidation of the problem of totemism.\u201d This difference in the\ntreatment of the two subjects is due to the fact that taboo still exists\nin our midst. To be sure, it is negatively conceived and directed to\ndifferent contents, but according to its psychological nature, it is\nstill nothing else than Kant\u2019s \u2018Categorical Imperative\u2019, which tends to\nact compulsively and rejects all conscious motivations. On the other\nhand, totemism is a religio-social institution which is alien to our\npresent feelings; it has long been abandoned and replaced by new forms.\nIn the religions, morals, and customs of the civilized races of to-day\nit has left only slight traces, and even among those races where it is\nstill retained, it has had to undergo great changes. The social and\nmaterial progress of the history of mankind could obviously change taboo\nmuch less than totemism.\nIn this book the attempt is ventured to find the original meaning of\ntotemism through its infantile traces, that is, through the indications\nin which it reappears in the development of our own children. The close\nconnection between totem and taboo indicates the further paths to the\nhypothesis maintained here. And although this hypothesis leads to\nsomewhat improbable conclusions, there is no reason for rejecting the\npossibility that it comes more or less near to the reality which is so\nhard to reconstruct.\nCONTENTS\nCHAP.

Beginning with the\nobservation of hysteria and the other neuroses[3] Professor Freud\ngradually extended his investigations to normal psychology and evolved\nnew concepts and new methods of study. The neurotic symptoms were no\nlonger imaginary troubles the nature of which one could not grasp, but\nwere conceived as mental and emotional maladjustments to one\u2019s\nenvironment. The stamp of degeneracy impressed upon neurotics by other\nschools of medicine was altogether eradicated. Deeper investigation\nshowed conclusively that a person might become neurotic if subjected to\ncertain environments, and that there was no definite dividing line\nbetween normal and abnormal. The hysterical symptoms, obsessions,\ndoubts, phobias, as well as hallucinations of the insane, show the same\nmechanisms as those similar psychic structures which one constantly\nencounters in normal persons in the form of mistakes in talking,\nreading, writing, forgetting[4], dreams and wit. The dream, always\nhighly valued by the populace, and as much despised by the educated\nclasses, has a definite structure and meaning when subjected to\nanalysis. Professor Freud\u2019s monumental work, _The Interpretation of\nDreams_[5], marked a new epoch in the history of mental science. One\nmight use the same words in reference to his profound analysis of\nwit[6].\nFaulty psychic actions, dreams and wit are products of the unconscious\nmental activity, and like neurotic or psychotic manifestations represent\nefforts at adjustment to one\u2019s environment. The slip of the tongue shows\nthat on account of unconscious inhibitions the individual concerned is\nunable to express his true thoughts; the dream is a distorted or plain\nexpression of those wishes which are prohibited in the waking states,\nand the witticism, owing to its veiled or indirect way of expression,\nenables the individual to obtain pleasure from forbidden sources. But\nwhereas dreams, witticisms, and faulty actions give evidences of inner\nconflicts which the individual overcomes, the neurotic or psychotic\nsymptom is the result of a failure and represents a morbid adjustment.\nThe aforementioned psychic formations are therefore nothing but\nmanifestations of the struggle with reality, the constant effort to\nadjust one\u2019s primitive feelings to the demands of civilization. In spite\nof all later development the individual retains all his infantile\npsychic structures. Nothing is lost; the infantile wishes and primitive\nimpulses can always be demonstrated in the grown-up and on occasion can\nbe brought back to the surface. In his dreams the normal person is\nconstantly reviving his childhood, and the neurotic or psychotic\nindividual merges back into a sort of psychic infantilism through his\nmorbid productions. The unconscious mental activity which is made up of\nrepressed infantile material for ever tries to express itself. Whenever\nthe individual finds it impossible to dominate the difficulties of the\nworld of reality there is a regression to the infantile, and psychic\ndisturbances ensue which are conceived as peculiar thoughts and acts.\nThus the civilized adult is the result of his childhood or the sum total\nof his early impressions; psychoanalysis thus confirms the old saying:\nThe child is father to the man.\nIt is at this point in the development of psychoanalysis that the paths\ngradually broadened until they finally culminated in this work. There\nwere many indications that the childhood of the individual showed a\nmarked resemblance to the primitive history or the childhood of races.\nThe knowledge gained from dream analysis and phantasies[7], when applied\nto the productions of racial phantasies, like myths and fairy tales,\nseemed to indicate that the first impulse to form myths was due to the\nsame emotional strivings which produced dreams, fancies and symptoms[8].\nFurther study in this direction has thrown much light on our great\ncultural institutions, such as religion, morality, law and philosophy,\nall of which Professor Freud has modestly formulated in this volume and\nthus initiated a new epoch in the study of racial psychology.\nI take great pleasure in acknowledging my indebtedness to Mr Alfred B.\nKuttner for the invaluable assistance he rendered in the translation of\nthis work.\nA. A. B<small>RILL</small>.\nTOTEM AND TABOO\nCHAPTER I\nTHE SAVAGE\u2019S DREAD OF INCEST\nPrimitive man is known to us by the stages of development through which\nhe has passed: that is, through the inanimate monuments and implements\nwhich he has left behind for us, through our knowledge of his art, his\nreligion and his attitude towards life, which we have received either\ndirectly or through the medium of legends, myths and fairy tales; and\nthrough the remnants of his ways of thinking that survive in our own\nmanners and customs. Moreover, in a certain sense he is still our\ncontemporary: there are people whom we still consider more closely\nrelated to primitive man than to ourselves, in whom we therefore\nrecognize the direct descendants and representatives of earlier man. We\ncan thus judge the so-called savage and semi-savage races; their psychic\nlife assumes a peculiar interest for us, for we can recognize in their\npsychic life a well-preserved, early stage of our own development.\nIf this assumption is correct, a comparison of the \u2018Psychology of\nPrimitive Races\u2019 as taught by folklore, with the psychology of the\nneurotic as it has become known through psychoanalysis will reveal\nnumerous points of correspondence and throw new light on subjects that\nare more or less familiar to us.\nFor outer as well as for inner reasons, I am choosing for this\ncomparison those tribes which have been described by ethnographists as\nbeing most backward and wretched: the aborigines of the youngest\ncontinent, namely Australia, whose fauna has also preserved for us so\nmuch that is archaic and no longer to be found elsewhere.\nThe aborigines of Australia are looked upon as a peculiar race which\nshows neither physical nor linguistic relationship with its nearest\nneighbours, the Melanesian, Polynesian and Malayan races. They do not\nbuild houses or permanent huts; they do not cultivate the soil or keep\nany domestic animals except dogs; and they do not even know the art of\npottery. They live exclusively on the flesh of all sorts of animals\nwhich they kill in the chase, and on the roots which they dig. Kings or\nchieftains are unknown among them, and all communal affairs are decided\nby the elders in assembly. It is quite doubtful whether they evince any\ntraces of religion in the form of worship of higher beings. The tribes\nliving in the interior who have to contend with the greatest\nvicissitudes of life owing to a scarcity of water, seem in every way\nmore primitive than those who live near the coast.\nWe surely would not expect that these poor naked cannibals should be\nmoral in their sex life according to our ideas, or that they should have\nimposed a high degree of restriction upon their sexual impulses. And yet\nwe learn that they have considered it their duty to exercise the most\nsearching care and the most painful rigour in guarding against\nincestuous sexual relations. In fact their whole social organization\nseems to serve this object or to have been brought into relation with\nits attainment.\nAmong the Australians the system of _Totemism_ takes the place of all\nreligious and social institutions. Australian tribes are divided into\nsmaller _septs_ or clans, each taking the name of its _totem_. Now what\nis a totem? As a rule it is an animal, either edible and harmless, or\ndangerous and feared; more rarely the totem is a plant or a force of\nnature (rain, water), which stands in a peculiar relation to the whole\nclan. The totem is first of all the tribal ancestor of the clan, as well\nas its tutelary spirit and protector; it sends oracles and, though\notherwise dangerous, the totem knows and spares its children. The\nmembers of a totem are therefore under a sacred obligation not to kill\n(destroy) their totem, to abstain from eating its meat or from any other\nenjoyment of it. Any violation of these prohibitions is automatically\npunished. The character of a totem is inherent not only in a single\nanimal or a single being but in all the members of the species. From\ntime to time festivals are held at which the members of a totem\nrepresent or imitate, in ceremonial dances, the movements and\ncharacteristics of their totems.\nThe totem is hereditary either through the maternal or the paternal\nline; (maternal transmission probably always preceded and was only later\nsupplanted by the paternal). The attachment to a totem is the foundation\nof all the social obligations of an Australian: it extends on the one\nhand beyond the tribal relationship, and on the other hand it supersedes\nconsanguineous relationship[9].\nThe totem is not limited to district or to locality; the members of a\ntotem may live separated from one another and on friendly terms with\nadherents of other totems[10].\nAnd now, finally, we must consider that peculiarity of the totemic\nsystem which attracts the interest of the psychoanalyst. Almost\neverywhere the totem prevails there also exists the law that _the\nmembers of the same totem are not allowed to enter into sexual relations\nwith each other; that is, that they cannot marry each other_. This\nrepresents the _exogamy_ which is associated with the totem.\nThis sternly maintained prohibition is very remarkable. There is nothing\nto account for it in anything that we have hitherto learned from the\nconception of the totem or from any of its attributes; that is, we do\nnot understand how it happened to enter the system of totemism. We are\ntherefore not astonished if some investigators simply assume that at\nfirst exogamy--both as to its origin and to its meaning--had nothing to\ndo with totemism, but that it was added to it at some time without any\ndeeper association, when marriage restrictions proved necessary. However\nthat may be, the association of totemism and exogamy exists, and proves\nto be very strong.\nLet us elucidate the meaning of this prohibition through further\ndiscussion.\n(_a_) The violation of the prohibition is not left to what is, so to\nspeak, an automatic punishment, as is the case with other violations of\nthe prohibitions of the totem (e.g., not to kill the totem animal), but\nis most energetically avenged by the whole tribe as if it were a\nquestion of warding off a danger that threatens the community as a whole\nor a guilt that weighs upon all. A few sentences from Frazer\u2019s book[11]\nwill show how seriously such trespasses are treated by these savages\nwho, according to our standard are otherwise very immoral.\n\u201cIn Australia the regular penalty for sexual intercourse with a person\nof a forbidden clan is death. It matters not whether the woman is of the\nsame local group or has been captured in war from another tribe; a man\nof the wrong clan who uses her as his wife is hunted down and killed by\nhis clansmen, and so is the woman; though in some cases, if they succeed\nin eluding capture for a certain time, the offence may be condoned. In\nthe Ta-Ta-thi tribe, New South Wales, in the rare cases which occur, the\nman is killed, but the woman is only beaten or speared, or both, till\nshe is nearly dead; the reason given for not actually killing her being\nthat she was probably coerced. Even in casual amours the clan\nprohibitions are strictly observed; any violations of these prohibitions\n\u2018are regarded with the utmost abhorrence and are punished by death\u2019\n(Howitt).\u201d\n(_b_) As the same severe punishment is also meted out for temporary love\naffairs which have not resulted in childbirth, the assumption of other\nmotives, perhaps of a practical nature, becomes improbable.\n(_c_) As the totem is hereditary and is not changed by marriage, the\nresults of the prohibition, for instance in the case of maternal\nheredity, are easily perceived. If, for example, the man belongs to a\nclan with the totem of the Kangaroo and marries a woman of the Emu\ntotem, the children, both boys and girls, are all Emu. According to the\ntotem law incestuous relations with his mother and his sister, who are\nEmu like himself, are therefore made impossible for a son of this\nmarriage[12].\n(_d_) But we need only a reminder to realize that the exogamy connected\nwith the totem accomplishes more; that is, aims at more than the\nprevention of incest with the mother or the sisters. It also makes it\nimpossible for the man to have sexual union with all the women of his\nown group, with a number of females, therefore, who are not\nconsanguineously related to him, by treating all these women like blood\nrelations. The psychological justification for this extraordinary\nrestriction, which far exceeds anything comparable to it among civilized\nraces, is not, at first, evident. All we seem to understand is that the\nr\u00f4le of the totem (the animal) as ancestor is taken very seriously.\nEverybody descended from the same totem is consanguineous; that is, of\none family; and in this family the most distant grades of relationship\nare recognized as an absolute obstacle to sexual union.\nThus these savages reveal to us an unusually high grade of incest dread\nor incest sensitiveness, combined with the peculiarity, which we do not\nvery well understand, of substituting the totem relationship for the\nreal blood relationship. But we must not exaggerate this contradiction\ntoo much, and let us bear in mind that the totem prohibitions include\nreal incest as a special case.\nIn what manner the substitution of the totem group for the actual family\nhas come about remains a riddle, the solution of which is perhaps bound\nup with the explanation of the totem itself. Of course it must be\nremembered that with a certain freedom of sexual intercourse, extending\nbeyond the limitations of matrimony, the blood relationship, and with it\nalso the prevention of incest, becomes so uncertain that we cannot\ndispense with some other basis for the prohibition. It is therefore not\nsuperfluous to note that the customs of Australians recognize social\nconditions and festive occasions at which the exclusive conjugal right\nof a man to a woman is violated.\nThe linguistic customs of these tribes, as well as of most totem races,\nreveals a peculiarity which undoubtedly is pertinent in this connection.\nFor the designations of relationship of which they make use do not take\ninto consideration the relationship between two individuals, but between\nan individual and his group; they belong, according to the expression of\nL. H. Morgan, to the \u2018classifying\u2019 system. That means that a man calls\nnot only his begetter \u2018father\u2019 but also every other man who, according\nto the tribal regulations, might have married his mother and thus become\nhis father; he calls \u2018mother\u2019 not only the woman who bore him but also\nevery other woman who might have become his mother without violation of\nthe tribal laws; he calls \u2018brothers\u2019 and \u2018sisters\u2019 not only the children\nof his real parents, but also the children of all the persons named who\nstand in the parental group relation with him, and so on. The kinship\nnames which two Australians give each other do not, therefore,\nnecessarily point to a blood relationship between them, as they would\nhave to according to the custom of our language; they signify much more\nthe social than the physical relations. An approach to this classifying\nsystem is perhaps to be found in our nursery, when the child is induced\nto greet every male and female friend of the parents as \u2018uncle\u2019 and\n\u2018aunt\u2019, or it may be found in a transferred sense when we speak of\n\u2018Brothers in Apollo\u2019, or \u2018Sisters in Christ\u2019.\nThe explanation of this linguistic custom, which seems so strange to us,\nis simple if looked upon as a remnant and indication of those marriage\ninstitutions which the Rev. L. Fison has called \u2018group marriage\u2019,\ncharacterized by a number of men exercising conjugal rights over a\nnumber of women. The children of this group marriage would then rightly\nlook upon each other as brothers and sisters although not born of the\nsame mother, and would take all the men of the group for their fathers.\nAlthough a number of authors, as, for instance, B. Westermarck in his\n_History of Human Marriage_[13], oppose the conclusions which others\nhave drawn from the existence of group-relationship names, the best\nauthorities on the Australian savages are agreed that the classificatory\nrelationship names must be considered as survivals from the period of\ngroup marriages. And, according to Spencer and Gillen[14], a certain\nform of group marriage can be established as still existing to-day among\nthe tribes of the Urabunna and the Dieri. Group marriage therefore\npreceded individual marriage among these races, and did not disappear\nwithout leaving distinct traces in language and custom.\nBut if we replace individual marriage, we can then grasp the apparent\nexcess of cases of incest shunning which we have met among these same\nraces. The totem exogamy, or prohibition of sexual intercourse between\nmembers of the same clan, seemed the most appropriate means for the\nprevention of group incest; and this totem exogamy then became fixed and\nlong survived its original motivation.\nAlthough we believe we understand the motives of the marriage\nrestrictions among the Australian savages, we have still to learn that\nthe actual conditions reveal a still more bewildering complication. For\nthere are only few tribes in Australia which show no other prohibition\nbesides the totem barrier. Most of them are so organized that they fall\ninto two divisions which have been called marriage classes, or\nphratries. Each of these marriage groups is exogamous and includes a\nmajority of totem groups. Usually each marriage group is again divided\ninto two subclasses (subphratries), and the whole tribe is therefore\ndivided into four classes; the subclasses thus standing between the\nphratries and the totem groups.\nThe typical and very often intricate scheme of organization of an\nAustralian tribe therefore looks as follows:\n[Illustration]\nThe twelve totem groups are brought under four subclasses and two main\nclasses. All the divisions are exogamous[15]. The subclass c forms an\nexogamous unit with e, and the subclass d with f. The success or the\ntendency of these arrangements is quite obvious; they serve as a further\nrestriction on the marriage choice and on sexual freedom. If there were\nonly these twelve totem groups--assuming the same number of people in\neach group--every member of a group would have 11/12 of all the women of\nthe tribe to choose from. The existence of the two phratries reduces\nthis number to 6/12 or 1/2; a man of the totem [Greek: \u03b1 alpha] can only\nmarry a woman from the groups 1 to 6. With the introduction of the two\nsubclassess the selection sinks to 3/12 or 1/4; a man of the totem\n[Greek: \u03b1 alpha] must limit his marriage choice to a woman of the totems\n4, 5, 6.\nThe historical relations of the marriage classes--of which there are\nfound as many as eight in some tribes--are quite unexplained. We only\nsee that these arrangements seek to attain the same object as the totem\nexogamy, and even strive for more. But whereas the totem exogamy makes\nthe impression of a sacred statute which sprang into existence, no one\nknows how, and is therefore a custom, the complicated institutions of\nthe marriage classes, with their sub-divisions and the conditions\nattached to them, seem to spring from legislation with a definite aim in\nview. They have perhaps taken up afresh the task of incest prohibition\nbecause the influence of the totem was on the wane. And while the totem\nsystem is, as we know, the basis of all other social obligations and\nmoral restrictions of the tribe, the importance of the phratries\ngenerally ceases when the regulation of the marriage choice at which\nthey aimed has been accomplished.\nIn the further development of the classification of the marriage system\nthere seems to be a tendency to go beyond the prevention of natural and\ngroup incest, and to prohibit marriage between more distant group\nrelations, in a manner similar to the Catholic church, which extended\nthe marriage prohibitions always in force for brother and sisters, to\ncousins, and invented for them the grades of spiritual kinship[16].\nIt would hardly serve our purpose to go into the extraordinarily\nintricate and unsettled discussion concerning the origin and\nsignificance of the marriage classes, or to go more deeply into their\nrelation to totemism. It is sufficient for our purposes to point out the\ngreat care expended by the Australians as well as by other savage people\nto prevent incest[17]. We must say that these savages are even more\nsensitive to incest than we, perhaps because they are more subject to\ntemptations than we are, and hence require more extensive protection\nagainst it.\nBut the incest dread of these races does not content itself with the\ncreation of the institutions described, which, in the main, seem to be\ndirected against group incest. We must add a series of \u2018customs\u2019 which\nwatch over the individual behaviour to near relatives in our sense,\nwhich are maintained with almost religious severity and of whose object\nthere can hardly be any doubt. These customs or custom prohibitions may\nbe called \u2018avoidances\u2019. They spread far beyond the Australian totem\nraces. But here again I must ask the reader to be content with a\nfragmentary excerpt from the abundant material.\nSuch restrictive prohibitions are directed in Melanesia against the\nrelations of boys with their mothers and sisters. Thus, for instance, on\nLepers Island, one of the New Hebrides, the boy leaves his maternal home\nat a fixed age and moves to the \u2018clubhouse\u2019, where he there regularly\nsleeps and takes his meals. He may still visit his home to ask for food;\nbut if his sister is at home he must go away before he has eaten; if no\nsister is about he may sit down to eat near the door. If brother and\nsister meet by chance in the open, she must run away or turn aside and\nconceal herself. If the boy recognizes certain footprints in the sand as\nhis sister\u2019s he is not to follow them, nor is she to follow his. He\nwill not even mention her name and will guard against using any current\nword if it forms part of her name. This avoidance, which begins with the\nceremony of puberty, is strictly observed for life. The reserve between\nmother and son increases with age and generally is more obligatory on\nthe mother\u2019s side. If she brings him something to eat she does not give\nit to him herself but puts it down before him, nor does she address him\nin the familiar manner of mother and son, but uses the formal address.\nSimilar customs obtain in New Caledonia. If brother and sister meet, she\nflees into the bush and he passes by without turning his head toward\nher[18].\nOn the Gazella Peninsula in New Britain a sister, beginning with her\nmarriage, may no longer speak with her brother, nor does she utter his\nname but designates him by means of a circumlocution[19].\nIn New Mecklenburg some cousins are subject to such restrictions, which\nalso apply to brothers and sisters. They may neither approach each\nother, shake hands, nor give each other presents, though they may talk\nto each other at a distance of several paces. The penalty for incest\nwith a sister is death through hanging[20].\nThese rules of avoidance are especially severe in the Fiji Islands where\nthey concern not only consanguineous sisters but group sisters as well.\nTo hear that these savages hold sacred orgies in which persons of just\nthese forbidden degrees of kinship seek sexual union would seem still\nmore peculiar to us, if we did not prefer to make use of this\ncontradiction to explain the prohibition instead of being astonished at\nit[21].\nAmong the Battas of Sumatra these laws of avoidance affect all near\nrelationships. For instance, it would be most offensive for a Battan to\naccompany his own sister to an evening party. A brother will feel most\nuncomfortable in the company of his sister even when other persons are\nalso present. If either comes into the house, the other prefers to\nleave. Nor will a father remain alone in the house with his daughter any\nmore than the mother with her son. The Dutch missionary who reported\nthese customs added that unfortunately he had to consider them well\nfounded. It is assumed without question by these races that a man and a\nwoman left alone together will indulge in the most extreme intimacy,\nand as they expect all kinds of punishments and evil consequences from\nconsanguineous intercourse they do quite right to avoid all temptations\nby means of such prohibitions[22].\nAmong the Barongos in Delagoa Bay, in Africa, the most rigorous\nprecautions are directed, curiously enough, against the sister-in-law,\nthe wife of the brother of one\u2019s own wife. If a man meets this person\nwho is so dangerous to him, he carefully avoids her. He does not dare to\neat out of the same dish with her; he speaks only timidly to her, does\nnot dare to enter her hut, and greets her only with a trembling\nvoice[23].\nAmong the Akamba (or Wakamba) in British East Africa, a law of avoidance\nis in force which one would have expected to encounter more frequently.\nA girl must carefully avoid her own father between the time of her\npuberty and her marriage. She hides herself if she meets him on the\nstreet and never attempts to sit down next to him, behaving in this way\nright up to her engagement. But after her marriage no further obstacle\nis put in the way of her social intercourse with her father[24].\nThe most widespread and strictest avoidance, which is perhaps the most\ninteresting one for civilized races is that which restricts the social\nrelations between a man and his mother-in-law. It is quite general in\nAustralia, but it is also in force among the Melanesian, Polynesian and\nNegro races of Africa as far as the traces of totemism and group\nrelationship reach, and probably further still. Among some of these\nraces similar prohibitions exist against the harmless social intercourse\nof a wife with her father-in-law, but these are by far not so constant\nor so serious. In a few cases both parents-in-law become objects of\navoidance.\nAs we are less interested in the ethnographic dissemination than in the\nsubstance and the purpose of the mother-in-law avoidance, I will here\nalso limit myself to a few examples.\nOn the Banks Island these prohibitions are very severe and painfully\nexact. A man will avoid the proximity of his mother-in-law as she avoids\nhis. If they meet by chance on a path, the woman steps aside and turns\nher back until he is passed, or he does the same.\nIn Vanna Lava (Port Patterson) a man will not even walk behind his\nmother-in-law along the beach until the rising tide has washed away the\ntrace of her footsteps. But they may talk to each other at a certain\ndistance. It is quite out of the question that he should ever pronounce\nthe name of his mother-in-law, or she his[25].\nOn the Solomon Islands, beginning with his marriage, a man must neither\nsee nor speak with his mother-in-law. If he meets her he acts as if he\ndid not know her and runs away as fast as he can in order to hide\nhimself[26].\nAmong the Zulu Kaffirs custom demands that a man should be ashamed of\nhis mother-in-law and that he should do everything to avoid her company.\nHe does not enter a hut in which she is, and when they meet he or she\ngoes aside, she perhaps hiding behind a bush while he holds his shield\nbefore his face. If they cannot avoid each other and the woman has\nnothing with which to cover herself, she at least binds a bunch of grass\naround her head in order to satisfy the ceremonial requirements.\nCommunication between them must either be made through a third person or\nelse they may shout at each other at a considerable distance if they\nhave some barrier between them as, for instance, the enclosure of a\nkraal. Neither may utter the other\u2019s name[27].\nAmong the Basogas, a negro tribe living in the region of the Nile\nsources, a man may talk to his mother-in-law only if she is in another\nroom of the house and is not visible to him. Moreover, this race\nabominates incest to such an extent as not to let it go unpunished even\namong domestic animals[28].\nWhereas all observers have interpreted the purpose and meaning of the\navoidances between near relatives as protective measures against incest,\ndifferent interpretations have been given for those prohibitions which\nconcern the relationship with the mother-in-law. It was quite\nincomprehensible why all these races should manifest such great fear of\ntemptation on the part of the man for an elderly woman, old enough to be\nhis mother[29].\nThe same objection was also raised against the conception of Fison who\ncalled attention to the fact that certain marriage class systems show a\ngap in that they make marriage between a man and his mother-in-law\ntheoretically not impossible and that a special guarantee was therefore\nnecessary to guard against this possibility.\nSir J. Lubbock, in his book _The Origin of Civilization_, traces back\nthe behaviour of the mother-in-law toward the son-in-law to the former\n\u2018marriage by capture\u2019. \u201cAs long as the capture of women actually took\nplace, the indignation of the parents was probably serious enough. When\nnothing but symbols of this form of marriage survived, the indignation\nof the parents was also symbolized and this custom continued after its\norigin had been forgotten.\u201d Crawley has found it easy to show how little\nthis tentative explanation agrees with the details of actual\nobservation.\nE. B. Tylor thinks that the treatment of the son-in-law on the part of\nthe mother-in-law is nothing more than a form of \u2018cutting\u2019 on the part\nof the woman\u2019s family. The man counts as a stranger, and this continues\nuntil the first child is born. But even if no account is taken of cases\nin which this last condition does not remove the prohibition, this\nexplanation is subject to the objection that it does not throw any light\non the custom dealing with the relation between mother-in-law and\nson-in-law, thus overlooking the sexual factor, and that it does not\ntake into account the almost sacred loathing which finds expression in\nthe laws of avoidance[30].\nA Zulu woman who was asked about the basis for this prohibition showed\ngreat delicacy of feeling in her answer: \u201cIt is not right that he\nshould see the breasts which nursed his wife.\u201d[31]\nIt is known that also among civilized races the relation of son-in-law\nand mother-in-law belongs to one of the most difficult sides of family\norganization. Although laws of avoidance no longer exist in the society\nof the white races of Europe and America, much quarrelling and\ndispleasure would often be avoided if they did exist and did not have to\nbe re-established by individuals. Many a European will see an act of\nhigh wisdom in the laws of avoidance which savage races have established\nto preclude any understanding between two persons who have become so\nclosely related. There is hardly any doubt that there is something in\nthe psychological situation of mother-in-law and son-in-law which\nfurthers hostilities between them and renders living together difficult.\nThe fact that the witticisms of civilized races show such a preference\nfor this very mother-in-law theme seems to me to point to the fact that\nthe emotional relations between mother-in-law and son-in-law are\ncontrolled by components which stand in sharp contrast to each other. I\nmean that the relation is really \u2018ambivalent\u2019, that is, it is composed\nof conflicting feelings of tenderness and hostility.\nA certain part of these feelings is evident. The mother-in-law is\nunwilling to give up the possession of her daughter; she distrusts the\nstranger to whom her daughter has been delivered, and shows a tendency\nto maintain the dominating position, to which she became accustomed at\nhome. On the part of the man, there is the determination not to subject\nhimself any longer to any foreign will, his jealousy of all persons who\npreceded him in the possession of his wife\u2019s tenderness, and, last but\nnot least, his aversion to being disturbed in his illusion of sexual\nover-valuation. As a rule such a disturbance emanates for the most part\nfrom his mother-in-law who reminds him of her daughter through so many\ncommon traits but who lacks all the charm of youth, such as beauty and\nthat psychic spontaneity which makes his wife precious to him.\nThe knowledge of hidden psychic feelings which psychoanalytic\ninvestigation of individuals has given us, makes it possible to add\nother motives to the above. Where the psycho-sexual needs of the woman\nare to be satisfied in marriage and family life, there is always the\ndanger of dissatisfaction through the premature termination of the\nconjugal relation, and the monotony in the wife\u2019s emotional life. The\nageing mother protects herself against this by living through the lives\nof her children, by identifying herself with them and making their\nemotional experiences her own. Parents are said to remain young with\ntheir children, and this is, in fact, one of the most valuable psychic\nbenefits which parents derive from their children. Childlessness thus\neliminates one of the best means to endure the necessary resignation\nimposed upon the individual through marriage. This emotional\nindentification with the daughter may easily go so far with the mother\nthat she also falls in love with the man her daughter loves, which\nleads, in extreme cases, to severe forms of neurotic ailments on account\nof the violent psychic resistance against this emotional predisposition.\nAt all events the tendency to such infatuation is very frequent with the\nmother-in-law, and either this infatuation itself or the tendency\nopposed to it joins the conflict of contending forces in the psyche of\nthe mother-in-law. Very often it is just this harsh and sadistic\ncomponent of the love emotion which is turned against the son-in-law in\norder better to suppress the forbidden tender feelings.\nThe relation of the husband to his mother-in-law is complicated through\nsimilar feelings which, however, spring from other sources. The path of\nobject selection has normally led him to his love object through the\nimage of his mother and perhaps of his sister; in consequence of the\nincest barriers his preference for these two beloved persons of his\nchildhood has been deflected and he is then able to find their image in\nstrange objects. He now sees the mother-in-law taking the place of his\nown mother and of his sister\u2019s mother, and there develops a tendency to\nreturn to the primitive selection, against which everything in him\nresists. His incest dread demands that he should not be reminded of the\ngenealogy of his love selection; the actuality of his mother-in-law,\nwhom he had not known all his life like his mother so that her picture\ncan be preserved unchanged in his unconscious, facilitates this\nrejection. An added mixture of irritability and animosity in his\nfeelings leads us to suspect that the mother-in-law actually represents\nan incest temptation for the son-in-law, just as it not infrequently\nhappens that a man falls in love with his subsequent mother-in-law\nbefore his inclination is transferred to her daughter.\nI see no objection to the assumption that it is just this incestuous\nfactor of the relationship which motivates the avoidance between son-and\nmother-in-law among savages. Among the explanations for the \u2018avoidances\u2019\nwhich these primitive races observe so strictly, we would therefore give\npreference to the opinion originally expressed by Fison, who sees\nnothing in these regulations but a protection against possible incest.\nThis would also hold good for all the other avoidances between those\nrelated by blood or by marriage. There is only one difference, namely,\nin the first case the incest is direct, so that the purpose of the\nprevention might be conscious; in the other case, which includes the\nmother-in-law relation, the incest would be a phantasy temptation\nbrought about by unconscious intermediary links.\nWe have had little opportunity in this exposition to show that the facts\nof folk-psychology can be seen in a new light through the application of\nthe psychoanalytic point of view, for the incest dread of savages has\nlong been known as such, and is in need of no further interpretation.\nWhat we can add to the further appreciation of incest dread is the\nstatement that it is a subtle infantile trait and is in striking\nagreement with the psychic life of the neurotic. Psychoanalysis has\ntaught us that the first object selection of the boy is of an incestuous\nnature and that it is directed to the forbidden objects, the mother and\nthe sister; pyschoanalysis has taught us also the methods through which\nthe maturing individual frees himself from these incestuous attractions.\nThe neurotic, however, regularly presents to us a piece of psychic\ninfantilism; he has either not been able to free himself from the\nchildlike conditions of psychosexuality, or else he has returned to them\n(inhibited development and regression). Hence the incestuous fixations\nof the libido still play or again are playing the main r\u00f4le in his\nunconscious psychic life. We have gone so far as to declare that the\nrelation to the parents instigated by incestuous longings is the central\ncomplex of the neurosis. This discovery of the significance of incest\nfor the neurosis naturally meets with the most general incredulity on\nthe part of the grown-up, normal man; a similar rejection will also meet\nthe researches of Otto Rank, which show in even larger scope to what\nextent the incest theme stands in the centre of poetical interest and\nhow it forms the material of poetry in countless variations and\ndistortions. We are forced to believe that such a rejection is above all\nthe product of man\u2019s deep aversion to his former incest wishes which\nhave since succumbed to repression. It is therefore of importance to us\nto be able to show that man\u2019s incest wishes, which later are destined to\nbecome unconscious, are still felt to be dangerous by savage races who\nconsider them worthy of the most severe defensive measures.\nCHAPTER II\nTABOO AND THE AMBIVALENCE OF EMOTIONS\n1\nTaboo is a Polynesian word, the translation of which provides\ndifficulties for us because we no longer possess the idea which it\nconnotes. It was still current with the ancient Romans: their word\n\u2018sacer\u2019 was the same as the taboo of the Polynesians. The [Greek: \u1f01\u03b3\u03bf\u03c2 hagos]\nof the Greeks and the Kodaush of the Hebrews must also have signified\nthe same thing which the Polynesians express through their word taboo\nand what many races in America, Africa (Madagascar), North and Central\nAsia express through analogous designations.\nFor us the meaning of taboo branches off into two opposite directions.\nOn the one hand it means to us sacred, consecrated: but on the other\nhand it means, uncanny, dangerous, forbidden, and unclean. The opposite\nfor taboo is designated in Polynesian by the word _noa_ and signifies\nsomething ordinary and generally accessible. Thus something like the\nconcept of reserve inheres in taboo; taboo expresses itself essentially\nin prohibitions and restrictions. Our combination of \u2018holy dread\u2019 would\noften express the meaning of taboo.\nThe taboo restrictions are different from religious or moral\nprohibitions. They are not traced to a commandment of a god but really\nthey themselves impose their own prohibitions; they are differentiated\nfrom moral prohibitions by failing to be included in a system which\ndeclares abstinences in general to be necessary and gives reasons for\nthis necessity. The taboo prohibitions lack all justification and are of\nunknown origin. Though incomprehensible to us they are taken as a matter\nof course by those who are under their dominance.\nWundt[32] calls taboo the oldest unwritten code of law of humanity. It\nis generally assumed that taboo is older than the gods and goes back to\nthe pre-religious age.\nAs we are in need of an impartial presentation of the subject of taboo\nbefore subjecting it to psychoanalytic consideration I shall now cite an\nexcerpt from the article _Taboo_ in the _Encyclopedia Britannica_\nwritten by the anthropologist Northcote W. Thomas[33]:\n\u201cProperly speaking taboo includes only (a) the sacred (or unclean)\ncharacter of persons or things, (b) the kind of prohibition which\nresults from this character, and (c) the sanctity (or uncleanliness)\nwhich results from a violation of the prohibition. The converse of taboo\nin Polynesia is \u2018noa\u2019 and allied forms which mean \u2018general\u2019 or \u2018common\u2019\n...\n\u201cVarious classes of taboo in the wider sense may be distinguished: 1.\nnatural or direct, the result of \u2018mana\u2019 mysterious (power) inherent in a\nperson or thing; 2. communicated or indirect, equally the result of\n\u2018mana\u2019 but (_a_) acquired or (_b_) imposed by a priest, chief or other\nperson; 3. intermediate, where both factors are present, as in the\nappropriation of a wife to her husband. The term taboo is also applied\nto ritual prohibitions of a different nature; but its use in these\nsenses is better avoided. It might be argued that the term should be\nextended to embrace cases in which the sanction of the prohibition is\nthe creation of a god or spirit, i.e., to religious interdictions as\ndistinguished from magical, but there is neither automatic action nor\ncontagion in such a case, and a better term for it is religious\ninterdiction.\n\u201cThe objects of the taboo are many: 1. direct taboos aim at (_a_)\nprotection of important persons--chiefs, priests, etc.--and things\nagainst harm; (_b_) safeguarding of the weak--women children and common\npeople generally--from the powerful mana (magical influence) of chiefs\nand priests; (_c_) providing against the dangers incurred by handling or\ncoming in contact with corpses, by eating certain food, etc.; (_d_)\nguarding the chief acts of life--births, initiation, marriage and sexual\nfunctions--against interference; (_e_) securing human beings against the\nwrath or power of gods and spirits[34]; (_f_) securing unborn infants\nand young children who stand in a specially sympathetic relation with\ntheir parents, from the consequence of certain actions, and more\nespecially from the communication of qualities supposed to be derived\nfrom certain foods. 2. Taboos are imposed in order to secure against\nthieves the property of an individual, his fields, tools, etc.\u201d\nOther parts of the article may be summarized as follows. Originally the\npunishment for the violation of a taboo was probably left to an inner,\nautomatic arrangement. The violated taboo avenged itself. Wherever the\ntaboo was related to ideas of gods and demons an automatic punishment\nwas expected from the power of the godhead. In other cases, probably as\na result of a further development of the idea, society took over the\npunishment of the offender, whose action has endangered his companions.\nThus man\u2019s first systems of punishment are also connected with taboo.\n\u201cThe violation of a taboo makes the offender himself taboo.\u201d The author\ngoes on to say that certain dangers resulting from the violation of a\ntaboo may be exercised through acts of penance and ceremonies of\npurification.\nA peculiar power inherent in persons and ghosts, which can be\ntransmitted from them to inanimate objects is regarded as the source of\nthe taboo. This part of the article reads as follows: \u201cPersons or things\nwhich are regarded as taboo may be compared to objects charged with\nelectricity; they are the seat of tremendous power which is\ntransmissible by contact, and may be liberated with destructive effect\nif the organisms which provoke its discharge are too weak to resist it;\nthe result of a violation of a taboo depends partly on the strength of\nthe magical influence inherent in the taboo object or person, partly on\nthe strength of the opposing mana of the violator of the taboo. Thus,\nkings and chiefs are possessed of great power, and it is death for their\nsubjects to address them directly; but a minister or other person of\ngreater _mana_ than common, can approach them unharmed, and can in turn\nbe approached by their inferiors without risk.... So, too, indirect\ntaboos depend for their strength on the mana of him who opposes them; if\nit is a chief or a priest, they are more powerful than those imposed by\na common person.\u201d\nThe fact that a taboo is transmissible has surely given rise to the\neffort of removing it through expiatory ceremonies.\nThe author states that there are permanent and temporary taboos. The\nformer comprise priests and chiefs as well as the dead and everything\nthat has belonged to them. Temporary taboos attach themselves to certain\nconditions such as menstruation and child-bed, the status of the warrior\nbefore and after the expedition, the activities of fishing and of the\nchase, and similar activities. A general taboo may also be imposed upon\na large district like an ecclesiastical interdict, and may then last for\nyears.\nIf I judge my readers\u2019 impressions correctly, I dare say that after\nhearing all that was said about taboo they are far from knowing what to\nunderstand by it and where to store it in their minds. This is surely\ndue to the insufficient information I have given and to the omission of\nall discussions concerning the relation of taboo to superstition, to\nbelief in the soul, and to religion. On the other hand I fear that a\nmore detailed description of what is known about taboo would be still\nmore confusing; I can therefore assure the reader that the state of\naffairs is really far from clear. We may say, however, that we deal with\na series of restrictions which these primitive races impose upon\nthemselves; this and that is forbidden without any apparent reason; nor\ndoes it occur to them to question this matter, for they subject\nthemselves to these restrictions as a matter of course and are convinced\nthat any transgression will be punished automatically in the most severe\nmanner. There are reliable reports that innocent transgressions of such\nprohibitions have actually been punished automatically. For instance,\nthe innocent offender who had eaten from a forbidden animal became\ndeeply depressed, expected his death and then actually died. The\nprohibitions mostly concern matters which are capable of enjoyment such\nas freedom of movement and unrestrained intercourse; in some cases they\nappear very ingenious, evidently representing abstinences and\nrenunciations; in other cases their content is quite incomprehensible,\nthey seem to concern themselves with trifles and give the impression of\nceremonials. Something like a theory seems to underlie all these\nprohibitions, it seems as if these prohibitions are necessary because\nsome persons and objects possess a dangerous power which is transmitted\nby contact with the object so charged, almost like a contagion. The\nquantity of this dangerous property is also taken into consideration.\nSome persons or things have more of it than others and the danger is\nprecisely in accordance with the charge. The most peculiar part of it is\nthat any one who has violated such a prohibition assumes the nature of\nthe forbidden object as if he had absorbed the whole dangerous charge.\nThis power is inherent in all persons who are more or less prominent,\nsuch as kings, priests and the newly born, in all exceptional physical\nstates such as menstruation, puberty and birth, in everything sinister\nlike illness and death and in everything connected with these conditions\nby virtue of contagion or dissemination.\nHowever, the term \u2018taboo\u2019 includes all persons, localities, objects and\ntemporary conditions which are carriers or sources of this mysterious\nattribute. The prohibition derived from this attribute is also\ndesignated as taboo, and lastly taboo, in the literal sense, includes\neverything that is sacred, above the ordinary, and at the same time\ndangerous, unclean and mysterious.\nBoth this word and the system corresponding to it express a fragment of\npsychic life which really is not comprehensible to us. And indeed it\nwould seem that no understanding of it could be possible without\nentering into the study of the belief in spirits and demons which is so\ncharacteristic of these low grades of culture.\nNow why should we take any interest at all in the riddle of taboo? Not\nonly, I think, because every psychological problem is well worth the\neffort of investigation for its own sake, but for other reasons as well.\nIt may be surmised that the taboo of Polynesian savages is after all not\nso remote from us as we were at first inclined to believe; the moral and\ncustomary prohibitions which we ourselves obey may have some essential\nrelation to this primitive taboo the explanation of which may in the end\nthrow light upon the dark origin of our own \u2018categorical imperative.\u2019\nWe are therefore inclined to listen with keen expectations when an\ninvestigator like W. Wundt gives his interpretation of taboo, especially\nas he promises to \u201cgo back to the very roots of the taboo concepts\u201d[35].\nWundt states that the idea of taboo \u201cincludes all customs which express\ndread of particular objects connected with cultic ideas or of actions\nhaving reference to them\u201d[36].\nOn another occasion he says: \u201cIn accordance with the general sense of\nthe word we understand by taboo every prohibition laid down in customs\nor manners or in expressly formulated laws, not to touch an object or to\ntake it for one\u2019s own use, or to make use of certain proscribed\nwords....\u201d Accordingly there would not be a single race or stage of\nculture which had escaped the injurious effects of taboo.\nWundt then shows why he finds it more practical to study the nature of\ntaboo in the primitive states of Australian savages rather than in the\nhigher culture of the Polynesian races. In the case of the Australians\nhe divides taboo prohibitions into three classes according as they\nconcern animals, persons or other objects. The animal taboo, which\nconsists essentially of the taboo against killing and eating, forms the\nnucleus of Totemism[37]. The taboo of the second class, which has human\nbeings for its object, is of an essentially different nature. To begin\nwith it is restricted to conditions which bring about an unusual\nsituation in life for the person tabooed. Thus young men at the feast of\ninitiation, women during menstruation and immediately after delivery,\nnewly born children, the deceased and especially the dead, are all\ntaboo. The constantly used property of any person, such as his clothes,\ntools and weapons, is permanently taboo for everybody else. In\nAustralia the new name which a youth receives at his initiation into\nmanhood becomes part of his most personal property, it is taboo and must\nbe kept secret. The taboos of the third class, which apply to trees,\nplants, houses and localities, are more variable and seem only to follow\nthe rule that anything which for any reason arouses dread or is\nmysterious, becomes subject to taboo.\nWundt himself has to acknowledge that the changes which taboo undergoes\nin the richer culture of the Polynesians and in the Malayan Archipelago\nare not very profound. The greater social differentiation of these races\nmanifests itself in the fact that chiefs, kings and priests exercise an\nespecially effective taboo and are themselves exposed to the strongest\ntaboo compulsion.\nBut the real sources of taboo lie deeper than in the interests of the\nprivileged classes: \u201cThey begin where the most primitive and at the same\ntime the most enduring human impulses have their origin, namely, _in the\nfear of the effect of demonic powers_\u201d[38]. \u201cThe taboo, which originally\nwas nothing more than the objectified fear of the demonic power thought\nto be concealed in the tabooed object, forbids the irritation of this\npower and demands the placation of the demon whenever the taboo has been\nknowingly or unknowingly violated.\u201d\nThe taboo then gradually became an autonomous power which has detached\nitself from demonism. It becomes the compulsion of custom and tradition\nand finally of the law. \u201cBut the commandment concealed behind taboo\nprohibitions which differ materially according to place and time, had\noriginally the meaning: Beware of the wrath of the demons.\u201d\nWundt therefore teaches that taboo is the expression and evolution of\nthe belief of primitive races in demonic powers, and that later taboo\nhas dissociated itself from this origin and has remained a power simply\nbecause it was one by virtue of a kind of a psychic persistence and in\nthis manner it became the root of our customs and laws. As little as one\ncan object to the first part of this statement I feel, however, that I\nam only voicing the impression of many of my readers if I call Wundt\u2019s\nexplanation disappointing. Wundt\u2019s explanation is far from going back to\nthe sources of taboo concepts or to their deepest roots. For neither\nfear nor demons can be accepted in psychology as finalities defying any\nfurther deduction. It would be different if demons really existed; but\nwe know that, like gods, they are only the product of the psychic\npowers of man; they have been created from and out of something.\nWundt also expresses a number of important though not altogether clear\nopinions about the double meaning of taboo. According to him the\ndivision between _sacred_ and _unclean_ does not yet exist in the first\nprimitive stages of taboo. For this reason these conceptions entirely\nlack the significance which they could only acquire later on when they\ncame to be contrasted. The animal, person or place on which there is a\ntaboo is demonic, that is, not sacred, and therefore not yet, in the\nlater sense, unclean. The expression taboo is particularly suitable for\nthis undifferentiated and intermediate meaning of the demonic, in the\nsense of something which may not be touched, since it emphasizes a\ncharacteristic which finally adheres both to what is sacred and to the\nunclean, namely, the dread of contact. But the fact that this important\ncharacteristic is permanently held in common points to the existence of\nan original agreement here between these two spheres which gave way to a\ndifferentiation only as the result of further conditions through which\nboth finally developed into opposites.\nThe belief associated with the original taboo, according to which a\ndemonic power concealed in the object avenges the touching of it or its\nforbidden use by bewitching the offender was still an entirely\nobjectified fear. This had not yet separated into the two forms which it\nassumed at a more developed stage, namely, awe and aversion.\nHow did this separation come about? According to Wundt, this was done\nthrough the transference of taboo prohibitions from the sphere of demons\nto that of theistic conceptions. The antithesis of sacred and unclean\ncoincides with the succession of two mythological stages the first of\nwhich did not entirely disappear when the second was reached but\ncontinued in a state of greatly lowered esteem which gradually turned\ninto contempt. It is a general law in mythology that a preceding stage,\njust because it has been overcome and pushed back by a higher stage,\nmaintains itself next to it in a debased form so that the objects of its\nveneration become objects of aversion[39].\nWundt\u2019s further elucidations refer to the relation of taboo to\nlustration and sacrifice.\n2\nHe who approaches the problem of taboo from the field of psychoanalysis,\nwhich is concerned with the study of the unconscious part of the\nindividual\u2019s psychic life, needs but a moment\u2019s reflection to realize\nthat these phenomena are by no means foreign to him. He knows people who\nhave individually created such taboo prohibitions for themselves, which\nthey follow as strictly as savages observe the taboos common to their\ntribe or society. If he were not accustomed to call these individuals\n\u2018compulsion neurotics\u2019 he would find the term \u2018taboo disease\u2019 quite\nappropriate for their malady. Psychoanalytic investigation has taught\nhim the clinical etiology and the essential part of the psychological\nmechanism of this compulsion disease, so that he cannot resist applying\nwhat he has learnt there to explain corresponding manifestations in folk\npsychology.\nThere is one warning to which we shall have to give heed in making this\nattempt. The similarity between taboo and compulsion disease may be\npurely superficial, holding good only for the manifestations of both\nwithout extending into their deeper characteristics. Nature loves to use\nidentical forms in the most widely different biological connections, as,\nfor instance, for coral stems and plants and even for certain crystals\nor for the formation of certain chemical precipitates. It would\ncertainly be both premature and unprofitable to base conclusions\nrelating to inner relationships upon the correspondence of merely\nmechanical conditions. We shall bear this warning in mind without,\nhowever, giving up our intended comparison on account of the possibility\nof such confusions.\nThe first and most striking correspondence between the compulsion\nprohibitions of neurotics and taboo lies in the fact that the origin of\nthese prohibitions is just as unmotivated and enigmatic. They have\nappeared at some time or other and must now be retained on account of an\nunconquerable anxiety. An external threat of punishment is superfluous,\nbecause an inner certainty (a conscience) exists that violation will be\nfollowed by unbearable disaster. The very most that compulsion patients\ncan tell us is the vague premonition that some person of their\nenvironment will suffer harm if they should violate the prohibition. Of\nwhat the harm is to consist is not known, and this inadequate\ninformation is more likely to be obtained during the later discussions\nof the expiatory and defensive actions than when the prohibitions\nthemselves are being discussed.\nAs in the case of taboo the nucleus of the neurotic prohibition is the\nact of touching, whence we derive the name \u2018touching phobia\u2019 or _d\u00e9lire\nde toucher_. The prohibition extends not only to direct contact with the\nbody but also to the figurative use of the phrase as \u2018to come into\ncontact\u2019 or \u2018be in touch with some one or something\u2019. Anything that\nleads the thoughts to what is prohibited and thus calls forth mental\ncontact is just as much prohibited as immediate bodily contact; this\nsame extension is also found in taboo.\nSome prohibitions are easily understood from their purpose but others\nstrike us as incomprehensible, foolish and senseless. We designate such\ncommands as \u2018ceremonials\u2019 and we find that taboo customs show the same\nvariations.\nObsessive prohibitions possess an extraordinary capacity for\ndisplacement; they make use of almost any form of connection to extend\nfrom one object to another and then in turn make this new object\n\u2018impossible\u2019, as one of my patients aptly puts it. This impossibility\nfinally lays an embargo upon the whole world. The compulsion neurotics\nact as if the \u2018impossible\u2019 persons and things were the carriers of a\ndangerous contagion which is ready to displace itself through contact to\nall neighbouring things. We have already emphasized the same\ncharacteristics of contagion and transference in the description of\ntaboo prohibitions. We also know that any one who has violated a taboo\nby touching something which is taboo becomes taboo himself, and no one\nmay come into contact with him.\nI shall put side by side two examples of transference or, to use a\nbetter term, displacement, one from the life of the Maori, and the\nother from my observation of a woman suffering from a compulsion\nneurosis:\n\u201cFor a similar reason a Maori chief would not blow on a fire with his\nmouth; for his sacred breath would communicate its sanctity to the fire,\nwhich would pass it on to the meat in the pot, which would pass it on to\nthe man who ate the meat which was in the pot, which stood on the fire,\nwhich was breathed on by the chief; so that the eater, infected by the\nchiefs breath conveyed through these intermediaries, would surely\ndie\u201d[40].\nMy patient demanded that a utensil which her husband had purchased and\nbrought home should be removed lest it make the place where she lives\nimpossible. For she has heard that this object was bought in a store\nwhich is situated, let us say, in Stag Street. But as the word \u2018stag\u2019 is\nthe name of a friend now in a distant city, whom she has known in her\nyouth under her maiden name and whom she now finds \u2018impossible\u2019, that is\ntaboo, the object bought in Vienna is just as taboo as this friend with\nwhom she does not want to come into contact.\nCompulsion prohibitions, like taboo prohibitions, entail the most\nextraordinary renunciations and restrictions of life, but a part of\nthese can be removed by carrying out certain acts which now also must be\ndone because they have acquired a compulsive character (obsessive acts);\nthere is no doubt that these acts are in the nature of penances,\nexpiations, defence reactions, and purifications. The most common of\nthese obsessive acts is washing with water (washing obsession). A part\nof the taboo prohibitions can also be replaced in this way, that is to\nsay, their violation can be made good through such a \u2018ceremonial\u2019, and\nhere too lustration through water is the preferred way.\nLet us now summarize the points in which the correspondence between\ntaboo customs and the symptoms of compulsion neurosis are most clearly\nmanifested: 1. In the lack of motivation of the commandments, 2. in\ntheir enforcement through an inner need, 3. in their capacity of\ndisplacement and in the danger of contagion from what is prohibited, 4.\nand in the causation of ceremonial actions and commandments which\nemanate from the forbidden.\nHowever, psychoanalysis has made us familiar with the clinical history\nas well as the psychic mechanism of compulsion neurosis. Thus the\nhistory of a typical case of touching phobia reads as follows: In the\nvery beginning, during the early period of childhood, the person\nmanifested a strong pleasure in touching himself, the object of which\nwas much more specialized than one would be inclined to suspect.\nPresently the carrying out of this very pleasurable act of touching was\nopposed by a prohibition from without[41]. The prohibition was accepted\nbecause it was supported by strong inner forces[42]; it proved to be\nstronger than the impulse which wanted to manifest itself through this\nact of touching. But due to the primitive psychic constitution of the\nchild this prohibition did not succeed in abolishing the impulse. Its\nonly success lay in repressing the impulse (the pleasure of touching)\nand banishing it into the unconscious. Both the prohibition and the\nimpulse remained; the impulse because it had only been repressed and not\nabolished, the prohibition, because if it had ceased the impulse would\nhave broken through into consciousness and would have been carried out.\nAn unsolved situation, a psychic fixation, had thus been created and now\neverything else emanated from the continued conflict between prohibition\nand impulse.\nThe main characteristic of the psychic constellation which has thus gone\nunder fixation lies in what one might call the ambivalent behaviour[43]\nof the individual to the object, or rather to an action regarding it.\nThe individual constantly wants to carry out this action (the act of\ntouching), he sees in it the highest pleasure, but he may not carry it\nout, and he even abominates it. The opposition between these two streams\ncannot be easily adjusted because--there is no other way to express\nit--they are so localized in the psychic life that they cannot meet. The\nprohibition becomes fully conscious, while the surviving pleasure of\ntouching remains unconscious, the person knowing nothing about it. If\nthis psychological factor did not exist the ambivalence could neither\nmaintain itself so long nor lead to such subsequent manifestations.\nIn the clinical history of the case we have emphasized the appearance of\nthe prohibition in early childhood as the determining factor; but for\nthe further elaboration of the neurosis this r\u00f4le is played by the\nrepression which appears at this age. On account of the repression which\nhas taken place, which is connected with forgetting (amnesia), the\nmotivation of the prohibition that has become conscious remains unknown,\nand all attempts to unravel it intellectually must fail, as the point of\nattack cannot be found. The prohibition owes its strength--its\ncompulsive character--to its association with its unknown counterpart,\nthe hidden and unabated pleasure, that is to say, to an inner need into\nwhich conscious insight is lacking. The transferability and reproductive\npower of the prohibition reflect a process which harmonizes with the\nunconscious pleasure and is very much facilitated through the\npsychological determinants of the unconscious. The pleasure of the\nimpulse constantly undergoes displacement in order to escape the\nblocking which it encounters and seeks to acquire surrogates for the\nforbidden in the form of substitutive objects and actions. For the same\nreason the prohibition also wanders and spreads to the new aims of the\nproscribed impulse. Every new advance of the repressed libido is\nanswered by the prohibition with a new severity. The mutual inhibition\nof these two contending forces creates a need for discharge and for\nlessening the existing tension, in which we may recognize the motivation\nfor the compulsive acts. In the neurosis there are distinctly acts of\ncompromise which on the one hand may be regarded as proofs of remorse\nand efforts to expiate and similar actions; but on the other hand they\nare at the same time substitutive actions which recompense the impulse\nfor what has been forbidden. It is a law of neurotic diseases that these\nobsessive acts serve the impulse more and more and come nearer and\nnearer to the original and forbidden act.\nWe may now make the attempt to study taboo as if it were of the same\nnature as the compulsive prohibitions of our patients. It must naturally\nbe clearly understood that many of the taboo prohibitions which we shall\nstudy are already secondary, displaced and distorted, so that we shall\nhave to be satisfied if we can shed some light upon the earliest and\nmost important taboo prohibitions. We must also remember that the\ndifferences in the situation of the savage and of the neurotic may be\nimportant enough to exclude complete correspondence and prevent a point\nby point transfer from one to the other such as would be possible if we\nwere dealing with exact copies.\nFirst of all it must be said that it is useless to question savages as\nto the real motivation of their prohibitions or as to the genesis of\ntaboo. According to our assumption they must be incapable of telling us\nanything about it since this motivation is \u2018unconscious\u2019 to them. But\nfollowing the model of the compulsive prohibition we shall construct the\nhistory of taboo as follows: Taboos are very ancient prohibitions which\nat one time were forced upon a generation of primitive people from\nwithout, that is, they probably were forcibly impressed upon them by an\nearlier generation. These prohibitions concerned actions for which there\nexisted a strong desire. The prohibitions maintained themselves from\ngeneration to generation, perhaps only as the result of a tradition set\nup by paternal and social authority. But in later generations they have\nperhaps already become \u2018organized\u2019 as a piece of inherited psychic\nproperty. Whether there are such \u2018innate ideas\u2019 or whether these have\nbrought about the fixation of the taboo by themselves or by co-operating\nwith education no one could decide in the particular case in question.\nThe persistence of taboo teaches, however, one thing, namely, that the\noriginal pleasure to do the forbidden still continues among taboo races.\nThey therefore assume an _ambivalent attitude_ toward their taboo\nprohibitions; in their unconscious they would like nothing better than\nto transgress them but they are also afraid to do it; they are afraid\njust because they would like to transgress, and the fear is stronger\nthan the pleasure. But in every individual of the race the desire for it\nis unconscious, just as in the neurotic.\nThe oldest and most important taboo prohibitions are the two basic laws\nof _totemism_: namely not to kill the totem animal, and to avoid sexual\nintercourse with totem companions of the other sex.\nIt would therefore seem that these must have been the oldest and\nstrongest desires of mankind. We cannot understand this and therefore we\ncannot use these examples to test our assumptions as long as the meaning\nand the origin of the totemic system is so wholly unknown to us. But the\nvery wording of these taboos and the fact that they occur together will\nremind any one who knows the results of the psychoanalytic investigation\nof individuals, of something quite definite which psychoanalysts call\nthe central point of the infantile wish life and the nucleus of the\nlater neurosis[44].\nAll other varieties of taboo phenomena which have led to the attempted\nclassifications noted above become unified if we sum them up in the\nfollowing sentence. The basis of taboo is a forbidden action for which\nthere exists a strong inclination in the unconscious.\nWe know, without understanding it, that whoever does what is prohibited\nand violates the taboo, becomes himself taboo. But how can we connect\nthis fact with the other, namely that the taboo adheres not only to\npersons who have done what is prohibited but also to persons who are in\nexceptional circumstances, to these circumstances themselves, and to\nimpersonal things? What can this dangerous attribute be which always\nremains the same under all these different conditions? Only one thing,\nnamely, the propensity to arouse the ambivalence of man and to tempt him\nto violate the prohibition.\nAn individual who has violated a taboo becomes himself taboo because he\nhas the dangerous property of tempting others to follow his example. He\narouses envy; why should he be allowed to do what is prohibited to\nothers? He is therefore really _contagious_, in so far as every example\nincites to imitation and therefore he himself must be avoided.\nBut a person may become permanently or temporarily taboo without having\nviolated any taboos, for the simple reason that he is in a condition\nwhich has the property of inciting the forbidden desires of others and\nof awakening the ambivalent conflict in them. Most of the exceptional\npositions and conditions have this character and possess this dangerous\npower. The king or chieftain rouses envy of his prerogatives; everybody\nwould perhaps like to be king. The dead, the newly born, and women when\nthey are incapacitated all act as incitements on account of their\npeculiar helplessness, while the individual who has just reached sexual\nmaturity tempts through the promise of a new pleasure. Therefore all\nthese persons and all these conditions are taboo, for one must not yield\nto the temptations which they offer.\nNow, too, we understand why the forces inherent in the \u2018mana\u2019 of various\npersons can neutralize one another so that the mana of one individual\ncan partly cancel that of the other. The taboo of a king is too strong\nfor his subject because the social difference between them is too great.\nBut a minister, for example, can become the harmless mediator between\nthem. Translated from the language of taboo into the language of normal\npsychology this means: the subject who shrinks from the tremendous\ntemptation which contact with the king creates for him can brook the\nintercourse of an official, whom he does not have to envy so much and\nwhose position perhaps seems attainable to him. The minister, on his\npart, can moderate his envy of the king by taking into consideration the\npower that has been granted to him. Thus smaller differences in the\nmagic power that lead to temptation are less to be feared than\nexceptionally big differences.\nIt is equally clear how the violation of certain taboo prohibitions\nbecomes a social danger which must be punished or expiated by all the\nmembers of society lest it harm them all. This danger really exists if\nwe substitute the known impulses for the unconscious desires. It\nconsists in the possibility of imitation, as a result of which society\nwould soon be dissolved. If the others did not punish the violation they\nwould perforce become aware that they want to imitate the evil doer.\nThough the secret meaning of a taboo prohibition cannot possibly be of\nso special a nature as in the case of a neurosis, we must not be\nastonished to find that touching plays a similar r\u00f4le in taboo\nprohibition as in the _d\u00e9lire de toucher_. To touch is the beginning of\nevery act of possession, of every attempt to make use of a person or\nthing.\nWe have interpreted the power of contagion which inheres in the taboo as\nthe property of leading into temptation, and of inciting to imitation.\nThis does not seem to be in accord with the fact that the contagiousness\nof the taboo is above all manifested in the transference to objects\nwhich thus themselves become carriers of the taboo.\nThis transferability of the taboo reflects what is found in the\nneurosis, namely, the constant tendency of the unconscious impulse to\nbecome displaced through associative channels upon new objects. Our\nattention is thus drawn to the fact that the dangerous magic power of\nthe \u2018mana\u2019 corresponds to two real faculties, the capacity of reminding\nman of his forbidden wishes, and the apparently more important one of\ntempting him to violate the prohibition in the service of these wishes.\nBoth functions reunite into one, however, if we assume it to be in\naccord with a primitive psychic life that with the awakening of a memory\nof a forbidden action there should also be combined the awakening of the\ntendency to carry out the action. Memory and temptation then again\ncoincide. We must also admit that if the example of a person who has\nviolated a prohibition leads another to the same action, the\ndisobedience of the prohibition has been transmitted like a contagion,\njust as the taboo is transferred from a person to an object, and from\nthis to another.\nIf the violation of a taboo can be condoned through expiation or\npenance, which means, of course, a _renunciation_ of a possession or a\nliberty, we have the proof that the observance of a taboo regulation was\nitself a renunciation of something really wished for. The omission of\none renunciation is cancelled through a renunciation at some other\npoint. This would lead us to conclude that, as far as taboo ceremonials\nare concerned, penance is more primitive than purification.\nLet us now summarize what understanding we have gained of taboo through\nits comparison with the compulsive prohibition of the neurotic. Taboo\nis a very primitive prohibition imposed from without (by an authority)\nand directed against the strongest desires of man. The desire to violate\nit continues in the unconscious; persons who obey the taboo have an\nambivalent feeling toward what is affected by the taboo. The magic power\nattributed to taboo goes back to its ability to lead man into\ntemptation; it behaves like a contagion, because the example is\ncontagious, and because the prohibited desire becomes displacing in the\nunconscious upon something else. The expiation for the violation of a\ntaboo through a renunciation proves that a renunciation is at the basis\nof the observance of the taboo.\n3\nWe may ask what we have gained from the comparison of taboo with\ncompulsion neurosis and what value can be claimed for the interpretation\nwe have given on the basis of this comparison? Our intrepretation is\nevidently of no value unless it affords an advantage not to be had in\nany other way and unless it affords a better understanding of taboo than\nwas otherwise possible. We might claim that we have already given proof\nof its usefulness in what has been said above; but we shall have to try\nto strengthen our proof by continuing the explanation of taboo\nprohibitions and customs in detail.\nBut we can avail ourselves of another method. We can shape our\ninvestigation so as to ascertain whether a part of the assumptions which\nwe have transferred from the neurosis to the taboo, or the conclusions\nat which we have thereby arrived can be demonstrated directly in the\nphenomena of taboo. We must decide, however, what we want to look for.\nThe assertion concerning the genesis of taboo, namely, that it was\nderived from a primitive prohibition which was once imposed from\nwithout, cannot, of course, be proved. We shall therefore seek to\nconfirm those psychological conditions for taboo with which we have\nbecome acquainted in the case of compulsion neurosis. How did we gain\nour knowledge of these psychological factors in the case of neurosis?\nThrough the analytical study of the symptoms, especially the compulsive\nactions, the defence reactions and the obsessive commands. These\nmechanisms gave every indication of having been derived from\n_ambivalent_ impulses or tendencies, they either represented\nsimultaneously the wish and counter-wish or they served preponderantly\none of the two contrary tendencies. If we should now succeed in showing\nthat ambivalence, i.e., the sway of contrary tendencies, exists also in\nthe case of taboo regulations or if we should find among taboo\nmechanisms some which like neurotic obsessions give simultaneous\nexpression to both currents, we would have established what is\npractically the most important point in the psychological correspondence\nbetween taboo and compulsion neurosis.\nWe have already mentioned that the two fundamental taboo prohibitions\nare inaccessible to our analysis because they belong to totemism;\nanother part of the taboo rules is of secondary origin and cannot be\nused for our purpose. For among these races taboo has become the general\nform of law giving and has helped to promote social tendencies which are\ncertainly younger; than taboo itself, as for instance, the taboos\nimposed by chiefs and priests to insure their property and privileges.\nBut there still remains a large group of laws which we may undertake to\ninvestigate. Among these I lay stress on those taboos which are attached\n(_a_) to enemies, (_b_) to chiefs, and (_c_) to the dead; the material\nfor our investigation is taken from the excellent collection of J. G.\nFrazer in his great work, _The Golden Bough_[45].\n(_A_) THE TREATMENT OF ENEMIES\nInclined as we may have been to ascribe to savage and semi-savage races\nuninhibited and remorseless cruelty towards their enemies, it is of\ngreat interest to us to learn that with them, too, the killing of a\nperson compels the observation of a series of rules which are associated\nwith taboo customs. These rules are easily brought under four groups;\nthey demand 1. reconciliation with the slain enemy, 2. restrictions, 3.\nacts of expiation, and purifications of the manslayer, and 4. certain\nceremonial rites. The incomplete reports do not allow us to decide with\ncertainty how general or how isolated such taboo customs may be among\nthese races, but this is a matter of indifference as far as our interest\nin these occurrences is concerned. Still, it may be assumed that we are\ndealing with widespread customs and not with isolated peculiarities.\nThe reconciliation customs practised on the island of Timor, after a\nvictorious band of warriors has returned with the severed heads of the\nvanquished enemy, are especially significant because the leader of the\nexpedition is subject to heavy additional restrictions. \u201cAt the solemn\nentry of the victors, sacrifices are made to conciliate the souls of the\nenemy; otherwise one would have to expect harm to come to the victors.\nA dance is given and a song is sung in which the slain enemy is mourned\nand his forgiveness is implored: \u2018Be not angry\u2019, they say \u2018because your\nhead is here with us; had we been less lucky, our heads might have been\nexposed in your village. We have offered the sacrifice to appease you.\nYour spirit may now rest and leave us at peace. Why were you our enemy?\nWould it not have been better that we should remain friends? Then your\nblood would not have been spilt and your head would not have been cut\noff\u2019\u201d[46].\nSimilar customs are found among the Palu in Celebes; the Gallas\nsacrifice to the spirits of their dead enemies before they return to\ntheir home villages[47].\nOther races have found methods of making friends, guardians and\nprotectors out of their former enemies after they are dead. This\nconsists in the tender treatment of the severed heads, of which many\nwild tribes of Borneo boast. When the See-Dayaks of Sarawak bring home a\nhead from a war expedition, they treat it for months with the greatest\nkindness and courtesy and address it with the most endearing names in\ntheir language. The best morsels from their meals are put into its\nmouth, together with titbits and cigars. The dead enemy is repeatedly\nentreated to hate his former friends and to bestow his love upon his new\nhosts because he has now become one of them. It would be a great mistake\nto think that any derision is attached to this treatment, horrible\nthough it may seem to us[48].\nObservers have been struck by the mourning for the enemy after he is\nslain and scalped, among several of the wild tribe of North America.\nWhen a Choctaw had killed an enemy he began a month\u2019s mourning during\nwhich he submitted himself to serious restrictions. The Dakota Indians\nmourned in the same way. One authority mentions that the Osaga Indians\nafter mourning for their own dead mourned for their foes as if they had\nbeen friends[49].\nBefore proceeding to the other classes of taboo customs for the\ntreatment of enemies, we must define our position in regard to a\npertinent objection. Both Frazer as well as other authorities may well\nbe quoted against us to show that the motive for these rules of\nreconciliation is quite simple and has nothing to do with \u2018ambivalence.\u2019\nThese races are dominated by a superstitious fear of the spirits of the\nslain, a fear which was also familiar to classical antiquity, and which\nthe great British dramatist brought upon the stage in the hallucinations\nof Macbeth and Richard the Third. From this superstition all the\nreconciliation rules as well as the restrictions and expiations which we\nshall discuss later can be logically deduced; moreover, the ceremonies\nincluded in the fourth group also argue for this interpretation, since\nthe only explanation of which they admit is the effort to drive away the\nspirits of the slain which pursue the manslayers[50]. Besides, the\nsavages themselves directly admit their fear for the spirits of their\nslain foes and trace back the taboo customs under discussion to this\nfear.\nThis objection is certainly pertinent and if it were adequate as well we\nwould gladly spare ourselves the trouble of our attempt to find a\nfurther explanation. We postpone the consideration of this objection\nuntil later and for the present merely contrast it to the interpretation\nderived from our previous discussion of taboo. All these rules of taboo\nlead us to conclude that other impulses besides those that are merely\nhostile find expression in the behaviour towards enemies. We see in them\nmanifestations of repentance, of regard for the enemy, and of a bad\nconscience for having slain him. It seems that the commandment, Thou\nshalt not slay, which could not be violated without punishment, existed\nalso among these savages, long before any legislation was received from\nthe hands of a god.\nWe now return to the remaining classes of taboo rules. The\n_restrictions_ laid upon the victorious manslayer are unusually frequent\nand are mostly of a serious nature. In Timor (compare the reconciliation\ncustoms mentioned above) the leader of the expedition cannot return to\nhis house under any circumstances. A special hut is erected for him in\nwhich he spends two months engaged in the observance of various rules of\npurification. During this period he may not see his wife or nourish\nhimself; another person must put his food in his mouth.[51] Among some\nDayak tribes warriors returning from a successful expedition must remain\nsequestered for several days and abstain from certain foods; they may\nnot touch iron and must remain away from their wives. In Logea, an\nisland near New Guinea, men who have killed an enemy or have taken part\nin the killing, lock themselves up in their houses for a week. They\navoid every intercourse with their wives and friends, they do not touch\ntheir victuals with their hands and live on nothing but vegetable foods\nwhich are cooked for them in special dishes. As a reason for this last\nrestriction it is alleged that they must smell the blood of the slain,\notherwise they would sicken and die. Among the Toaripi-or\nMotumotu-tribes in New Guinea a manslayer must not approach his wife and\nmust not touch his food with his fingers. A second person must feed him\nwith special food. This continues until the next new moon.\nI avoid the complete enumeration of all the cases of restrictions of the\nvictorious slayer mentioned by Frazer, and emphasize only such cases in\nwhich the character of taboo is especially noticeable or where the\nrestriction appears in connection with expiation, purification and\nceremonial.\nAmong the Monumbos in German New Guinea a man who has killed an enemy in\ncombat becomes \u2018unclean\u2019, the same word being employed which is applied\nto women during menstruation or confinement. For a considerable period\nhe is not allowed to leave the men\u2019s club-house, while the inhabitants\nof his village gather about him and celebrate his victory with songs and\ndances. He must not touch any one, not even his wife and children; if he\ndid so they would be afflicted with boils. He finally becomes clean\nthrough washing and other ceremonies.\nAmong the Natchez in North America young warriors who had procured their\nfirst scalp were bound for six months to the observance of certain\nrenunciations. They were not allowed to sleep with their wives or to eat\nmeat, and received only fish and maize pudding as nourishment. When a\nChoctaw had killed and scalped an enemy he began a period of mourning\nfor one month, during which he was not allowed to comb his hair. When\nhis head itched he was not allowed to scratch it with his hand but used\na small stick for this purpose.\nAfter a Pima Indian had killed an Apache he had to submit himself to\nsevere ceremonies of purification and expiation. During a fasting period\nof sixteen days he was not allowed to touch meat or salt, to look at a\nfire or to speak to any one. He lived alone in the woods, where he was\nwaited upon by an old woman who brought him a small allowance of food;\nhe often bathed in the nearest river, and carried a lump of clay on his\nhead as a sign of mourning. On the seventeenth day there took place a\npublic ceremony through which he and his weapons were solemnly purified.\nAs the Pima Indians took the manslayer taboo much more seriously than\ntheir enemies and, unlike them, did not postpone expiation and\npurification until the end of the expedition, their prowess in war\nsuffered very much through their moral severity or what might be called\ntheir piety. In spite of their extraordinary bravery they proved to be\nunsatisfactory allies to the Americans in their wars against the\nApaches.\nThe detail and variations of these expiatory and purifying ceremonies\nafter the killing of an enemy would be most interesting for purposes of\na more searching study, but I need not enumerate any more of them here\nbecause they cannot furnish us with any new points of view. I might\nmention that the temporary or permanent isolation of the professional\nexecutioner, which was maintained up to our time, is a case in point.\nThe position of the \u2018free-holder\u2019 in medi\u00e6val society really conveys a\ngood idea of the \u2018taboo\u2019 of savages[52].\nThe current explanation of all these rules of reconciliation,\nrestriction, expiation and purification, combines two principles,\nnamely, the extension of the taboo of the dead to everything that has\ncome into contact with him, and the fear of the spirit of the slain. In\nwhat combination these two elements are to explain the ceremonial,\nwhether they are to be considered as of equal value or whether one of\nthem is primary and the other secondary, and which one, is nowhere\nstated, nor would this be an easy matter to decide. In contradistinction\nto all this we emphasize the unity which our interpretation gains by\ndeducing all these rules from the ambivalence of the emotion of savages\ntowards their enemies.\n(_B_) THE TABOO OF RULERS\nThe behaviour of primitive races towards their chiefs, kings, and\npriests, is controlled by two principles which seem rather to supplement\nthan to contradict each other. They must both be guarded and be guarded\nagainst[53].\nBoth objects are accomplished through innumerable rules of taboo. Why\none must guard against rulers is already known to us; because they are\nthe bearers of that mysterious and dangerous magic power which\ncommunicates itself by contact, like an electric charge, bringing death\nand destruction to any one not protected by a similar charge. All direct\nor indirect contact with this dangerous sacredness is therefore avoided,\nand where it cannot be avoided a ceremonial has been found to ward off\nthe dreaded consequences. The Nubas in East Africa, for instance,\nbelieve that they must die if they enter the house of their\npriest-king, but that they escape this danger if, on entering, they bare\nthe left shoulder and induce the king to touch it with his hand. Thus we\nhave the remarkable case of the king\u2019s touch becoming the healing and\nprotective measure against the very dangers that arise from contact with\nthe king; but it is probably a question of the healing power of the\nintentional touching on the king\u2019s part in contradistinction to the\ndanger of touching him, in other words, of the opposition between\npassivity and activity towards the king.\nWhere the healing power of the royal touch is concerned we do not have\nto look for examples among savages. In comparatively recent times the\nkings of England exercised this power upon scrofula, whence it was\ncalled \u2018The King\u2019s Evil\u2019. Neither Queen Elizabeth nor any of her\nsuccessors renounced this part of the royal prerogative. Charles I is\nsaid to have healed a hundred sufferers at one time, in the year 1633.\nUnder his dissolute son Charles II, after the great English revolution\nhad passed, royal healings of scrofula attained their greatest vogue.\nThis king is said to have touched close to a hundred thousand victims of\nscrofula in the course of his reign. The crush of those seeking to be\ncured used to be so great that on one occasion six or seven patients\nsuffered death by suffocation instead of being healed. The sceptical\nking of Orange, William III, who became king of England after the\nbanishment of the Stuarts, refused to exercise the spell; on the one\noccasion when he consented to practise the touch, he did so with words:\n\u201cMay God give you better health and more sense\u201d[54].\nThe following account will bear witness to the terrible effect of\ntouching by virtue of which a person, even though unintentionally,\nbecomes active against his king or against what belongs to him. A chief\nof high rank and great holiness in New Zealand happened to leave the\nremains of his meal by the roadside. A young slave came along, a strong\nhealthy fellow, who saw what was left over and started to eat it. Hardly\nhad he finished when a horrified spectator informed him of his offence\nin eating the meal of the chief. The man had been a strong, brave\nwarrior, but as soon as he heard this he collapsed and was afflicted by\nterrible convulsions, from which he died towards sunset of the following\nday[55]. A Maori woman ate a certain fruit and then learned that it came\nfrom a place on which there was a taboo. She cried out that the spirit\nof the chief whom she had thus offended would surely kill her. This\nincident occurred in the afternoon, and on the next day at twelve\no\u2019clock she was dead[56]. The tinder box of a Maori chief once cost\nseveral persons their lives. The chief had lost it, and those who found\nit used it to light their pipes. When they learned whose property the\ntinder box was they all died of fright[57].\nIt is hardly astonishing that the need was felt to isolate dangerous\npersons like chiefs and priests, by building a wall around them which\nmade them inaccessible to others. We surmise that this wall, which\noriginally was constructed out of taboo rules, still exists to-day in\nthe form of court ceremony.\nBut probably the greater part of this taboo of the rulers cannot be\ntraced back to the need of guarding against them. The other point of\nview in the treatment of privileged persons, the need of guarding them\nfrom dangers with which they are threatened, has had a distinct share in\nthe creation of taboo and therefore of the origin of court etiquette.\nThe necessity of guarding the king from every conceivable danger arises\nfrom his great importance for the weal and woe of his subjects. Strictly\nspeaking, he is a person who regulates the course of the world; his\npeople have to thank him not only for rain and sunshine, which allow the\nfruits of the earth to grow, but also for the wind which brings the\nships to their shores and for the solid ground on which they set their\nfeet[58].\nThese savage kings are endowed with a wealth of power and an ability to\nbestow happiness which only gods possess; certainly in later stages of\ncivilization none but the most servile courtiers would play the\nhypocrite to the extent of crediting their sovereigns with the\npossession of attributes similar to these.\nIt seems like an obvious contradiction that persons of such perfection\nof power should themselves require the greatest care to guard them\nagainst threatening dangers, but this is not the only contradiction\nrevealed in the treatment of royal persons on the part of savages. These\nraces consider it necessary to watch over their kings to see that they\nuse their powers in the right way; they are by no means sure of their\ngood intentions or of their conscientiousness. A strain of mistrust is\nmingled with the motivation of the taboo rules for the king. \u201cThe idea\nthat early kingdoms are despotisms\u201d, says Frazer[59], \u201cin which the\npeople exist only for the sovereign, is wholly inapplicable to the\nmonarchies we are considering. On the contrary, the sovereign in them\nexists only for his subjects: his life is only valuable so long as he\ndischarges the duties of his position by ordering the course of nature\nfor his people\u2019s benefit. So soon as he fails to do so, the care, the\ndevotion, the religious homage which they had hitherto lavished on him\ncease and are changed into hatred and contempt; he is ignominiously\ndismissed and may be thankful if he escapes with his life. Worshipped as\na god one day, he is killed as a criminal the next. But in this changed\nbehaviour of the people there is nothing capricious or inconsistent. On\nthe contrary, their conduct is quite consistent. If their king is their\ngod he is or should be, also their preserver; and if he will not\npreserve them he must make room for another who will. So long, however,\nas he answers their expectations, there is no limit to the care which\nthey take of him, and which they compel him to take of himself. A king\nof this sort lives hedged in by ceremonious etiquette, a network of\nprohibitions and observances, of which the intention is not to\ncontribute to his dignity, much less to his comfort, but to restrain him\nfrom conduct which, by disturbing the harmony of nature, might involve\nhimself, his people, and the universe in one common catastrophe. Far\nfrom adding to his comfort, these observances, by trammelling his every\nact, annihilate his freedom and often render the very life, which it is\ntheir object to preserve, a burden and sorrow to him.\u201d\nOne of the most glaring examples of thus fettering and paralysing a holy\nruler through taboo ceremonial seems to have been reached in the life\nroutine of the Mikado of Japan, as it existed in earlier centuries. A\ndescription which is now over two hundred years old[60] relates: \u201cHe\nthinks that it would be very prejudicial to his dignity and holiness to\ntouch the ground with his feet; for this reason when he intends to go\nanywhere, he must be carried thither on men\u2019s shoulders. Much less will\nthey suffer that he should expose his sacred person to the open air, and\nthe sun is not thought worthy to shine on his head. There is such a\nholiness ascribed to all the parts of his body that he dares to cut off\nneither his hair, nor his beard, nor his nails. However, lest he should\ngrow too dirty, they may clean him in the night when he is asleep;\nbecause they say that what is taken from his body at that time, hath\nbeen stolen from him, and that such a theft does not prejudice his\nholiness or dignity. In ancient times, he was obliged to sit on the\nthrone for some hours every morning, with the imperial crown on his\nhead; but to sit altogether like a statue without stirring either hands\nor feet, head or eyes, nor indeed any part of his body, because by this\nmeans it was thought that he could preserve peace and tranquillity in\nhis empire; for if unfortunately, he turned himself on one side or\nother, or if he looked a good while towards any part of his dominion, it\nwas apprehended that war, famine, fire or some other great misfortune\nwas near at hand to desolate the country.\u201d\nSome of the taboos to which barbarian kings are subject vividly recall\nthe restrictions placed on murderers. On Shark Point at Cape Padron in\nLower Guinea (West Africa), a priest-king called Kukulu lives alone in a\nwoods. He is not allowed to touch a woman or to leave his house and\ncannot even rise out of his chair, in which he must sleep in a sitting\nposition. If he should lie down the wind would cease and shipping would\nbe disturbed. It is his function to keep storms in check, and in\ngeneral, to see to an even, healthy condition of the atmosphere[61]. The\nmore powerful a king of Loango is, says Bastian, the more taboos he must\nobserve. The heir to the throne is also bound to them from childhood on;\nthey accumulate about him while he is growing up, and by the time of\nhis accession he is suffocated by them.\nOur interest in the matter does not require us to take up more space to\ndescribe more fully the taboos that cling to royal and priestly dignity.\nWe merely add that restrictions as to freedom of movement and diet play\nthe main r\u00f4le among them. But two examples of taboo ceremonial taken\nfrom civilized nations, and therefore from much higher stages of\nculture, will indicate to what an extent association with these\nprivileged persons tends to preserve ancient customs.\nThe Flamen _Dialis_, the high-priest of Jupiter in Rome, had to observe\nan extraordinarily large number of taboo rules. He was not allowed to\nride, to see a horse or an armed man, to wear a ring that was not\nbroken, to have a knot in his garments, to touch wheat flour or leaven,\nor even to mention by name a goat, a dog, raw meat, beans and ivy; his\nhair could only be cut by a free man and with a bronze knife, his hair\ncombings and nail parings had to be buried under a lucky tree; he could\nnot touch the dead, go into the open with bare head, and similar\nprohibitions. His wife, the Flaminica, also had her own prohibitions:\nshe was not allowed to ascend more than three steps on a certain kind of\nstairs and on certain holidays she could not comb her hair; the leather\nfor her shoes could not be taken from any animal that had died a\nnatural death but only from one that had been slaughtered or sacrificed;\nwhen she heard thunder she was unclean until she had made an expiatory\nsacrifice[62].\nThe old kings of Ireland were subject to a series of very curious\nrestrictions, the observance of which was expected to bring every\nblessing to the country while their violation entailed every form of\nevil. The complete description of these taboos is given in the _Book of\nRights_, of which the oldest manuscript copies bear the dates 1890 and\n1418. The prohibitions are very detailed and concern certain activities\nat specified places and times; in some cities, for instance, the king\ncannot stay on a certain day of the week, while at some specified hour\nthis or that river may not be crossed, or again there is a plane on\nwhich he cannot camp a full nine days, etc.[63]\nAmong many savage races the severity of the taboo restrictions for the\npriest-kings has had results of historic importance which are especially\ninteresting from our point of view. The honour of being a priest-king\nceased to be desirable; the person in line for the succession often used\nevery means to escape it. Thus in Combodscha, where there is a fire and\nwater king, it is often necessary to use force to compel the successor\nto accept the honour. On Niue or Savage Island, a coral island in the\nPacific Ocean, monarchy actually came to an end because nobody was\nwilling to undertake the responsible and dangerous office. In some parts\nof West Africa a general council is held after the death of the king to\ndetermine upon the successor. The man on whom the choice falls is\nseized, tied and kept in custody in the fetish house until he has\ndeclared himself willing to accept the crown. Sometimes the presumptive\nsuccessor to the throne finds ways and means to avoid the intended\nhonour; thus it is related of a certain chief that he used to go armed\nday and night and resist by force every attempt to place him on the\nthrone[64]. Among the negroes of Sierra Leone the resistance against\naccepting the kingly honour was so great that most of the tribes were\ncompelled to make strangers their kings.\nFrazer makes these conditions responsible for the fact that in the\ndevelopment of history a separation of the original priest-kingship into\na spiritual and a secular power finally took place. Kings, crushed by\nthe burden of their holiness, became incapable of exercising their power\nover real things and had to leave this to inferior but executive persons\nwho were willing to renounce the honours of royal dignity. From these\nthere grew up the secular rulers, while the spiritual over-lordship,\nwhich was now of no practical importance, was left to the former taboo\nkings. It is well known to what extent this hypothesis finds\nconfirmation in the history of old Japan.\nA survey of the picture of the relations of primitive peoples to their\nrulers gives rise to the expectation that our advance from description\nto psychoanalytic understanding will not be difficult. These relations\nare of an involved nature and are not free from contradictions. Rulers\nare granted great privileges which are practically cancelled by taboo\nprohibitions in regard to other privileges. They are privileged persons,\nthey can do or enjoy what is withheld from the rest through taboo. But\nin contrast to this freedom they are restricted by other taboos which do\nnot affect the ordinary individual. Here, therefore, is the first\ncontrast, which amounts almost to a contradiction, between an excess of\nfreedom and an excess of restriction as applied to the same persons.\nThey are credited with extraordinary magic powers, and contact with\ntheir person or their property is therefore feared, while on the other\nhand the most beneficial effect is expected from these contacts. This\nseems to be a second and an especially glaring contradiction; but we\nhave already learned that it is only apparent. The king\u2019s touch,\nexercised by him with benevolent intention, heals and protects; it is\nonly when a common man touches the king or his royal effects that the\ncontact becomes dangerous, and this is probably because the act may\nrecall aggressive tendencies. Another contradiction which is not so\neasily solved is expressed in the fact that great power over the\nprocesses of nature is ascribed to the ruler and yet the obligation is\nfelt to guard him with especial care against threatening dangers, as if\nhis own power, which can do so much, were incapable of accomplishing\nthis. A further difficulty in the relation arises because there is no\nconfidence that the ruler will use his tremendous power to the advantage\nof his subjects as well as for his own protection; he is therefore\ndistrusted and surveillance over him is considered to be justified. The\ntaboo etiquette, to which the life of the king is subject,\nsimultaneously serves all these objects of exercising a tutelage over\nthe king, of guarding him against dangers and of guarding his subjects\nagainst danger which he brings to them.\nWe are inclined to give the following explanation of the complicated and\ncontradictory relation of the primitive peoples to their rulers. Through\nsuperstition as well as through other motives, various tendencies find\nexpression in the treatment of kings, each of which is developed to the\nextreme without regard to the other. As a result of this, contradictions\narise at which the intellect of savages takes no more offence than a\nhighly civilized person would as long as it is only a question of\nreligious matters or of \u2018loyalty\u2019.\nThat would be so far so good; but the psychoanalytic technique may\nenable us to penetrate more deeply into the matter and to add something\nabout the nature of these various tendencies. If we subject the facts as\nstated to analysis, just as if they formed the symptoms of a neurosis,\nour first attention would be directed to the excess of anxious worry\nwhich is said to be the cause of the taboo ceremonial. The occurrence of\nsuch excessive tenderness is very common in the neurosis and especially\nin the compulsion neurosis upon which we are drawing primarily for our\ncomparison. We now thoroughly understand the origin of this tenderness.\nIt occurs wherever, besides the predominant tenderness, there exists a\ncontrary but unconscious stream of hostility, that is to say, wherever\nthe typical case of an ambivalent affective attitude is realized. The\nhostility is then cried down by an excessive increase of tenderness\nwhich is expressed as anxiety and becomes compulsive because otherwise\nit would not suffice for its task of keeping the unconscious opposition\nin a state of repression. Every psychoanalyst knows how infallibly this\nanxious excess of tenderness can be resolved even under the most\nimprobable circumstances, as for instance, when it appears between\nmother and child, or in the case of affectionate married people. Applied\nto the treatment of privileged persons this theory of an ambivalent\nfeeling would reveal that their veneration, their very deification, is\nopposed in the unconscious by an intense hostile tendency, so that, as\nwe had expected, the situation of an ambivalent feeling is here\nrealized. The distrust which certainly seems to contribute to the\nmotivation of the royal taboo, would be another direct manifestation of\nthe same unconscious hostility. Indeed the ultimate issues of this\nconflict show such a diversity among different races that we would not\nbe at a loss for examples in which the proof of such hostility would be\nmuch easier. We learn from Frazer[65] that the savage Timmes of Sierra\nLeone reserve the right to administer a beating to their elected king on\nthe evening before his coronation, and that they make use of this\nconstitutional right with such thoroughness that the unhappy ruler\nsometimes does not long survive his accession to the throne; for this\nreason the leaders of the race have made it a rule to elect some man\nagainst whom they have a particular grudge. Nevertheless, even in such\nglaring cases the hostility is not acknowledged as such, but is\nexpressed as if it were a ceremonial.\nAnother trait in the attitude of primitive races towards their rulers\nrecalls a mechanism which is universally present in mental disturbances,\nand is openly revealed in the so-called delusions of persecution. Here\nthe importance of a particular person is extraordinarily heightened and\nhis omnipotence is raised to the improbable in order to make it easier\nto attribute to him the responsibility for everything painful which\nhappens to the patient. Savages really do not act differently towards\ntheir rulers when they ascribe to them power over rain and shine, wind\nand weather, and then dethrone or kill them because nature has\ndisappointed their expectation of a good hunt or a ripe harvest. The\nprototype which the paranoiac reconstructs in his persecution mania, is\nfound in the relation of the child to its father. Such omnipotence is\nregularly attributed to the father in the imagination of the son, and\ndistrust of the father has been shown to be intimately connected with\nthe highest esteem for him. When a paranoiac names a person of his\nacquaintance as his \u2018persecutor\u2019, he thereby elevates him to the\npaternal succession and brings him under conditions which enable him to\nmake him responsible for all the misfortune which he experiences. Thus\nthis second analogy between the savage and the neurotic may allow us to\nsurmise how much in the relation of the savage to his ruler arises from\nthe infantile attitude of the child to its father.\nBut the strongest support for our point of view, which seeks to compare\ntaboo prohibitions with neurotic symptoms, is to be found in the taboo\nceremonial itself, the significance of which for the status of kinship\nhas already been the subject of our previous discussion. This ceremonial\nunmistakably reveals its double meaning and its origin from ambivalent\ntendencies if only we are willing to assume that the effects it produces\nare those which it intended from the very beginning. It not only\ndistinguishes kings and elevates them above all ordinary mortals, but it\nalso makes their life a torture and an unbearable burden and forces them\ninto a thraldom which is far worse than that of their subjects. It would\nthus be the correct counterpart to the compulsive action of the\nneurosis, in which the suppressed impulse and the impulse which\nsuppresses it meet in mutual and simultaneous satisfaction. The\ncompulsive action is nominally a protection against the forbidden\naction; but we would say that actually it is a repetition of what is\nforbidden. The word \u2018nominally\u2019 is here applied to the conscious whereas\nthe word \u2018actually\u2019 applies to the unconscious instance of the psychic\nlife. Thus also the taboo ceremonial of kings is nominally an expression\nof the highest veneration and a means of guarding them; actually it is\nthe punishment for their elevation, the revenge which their subjects\ntake upon them. The experiences which Cervantes makes Sancho Panza\nundergo as governor on his island have evidently made him recognize this\ninterpretation of courtly ceremonial as the only correct one. It is very\npossible that this point would be corroborated if we could induce kings\nand rulers of to-day to express themselves on this point.\nWhy the emotional attitude towards rulers should contain such a strong\nunconscious share of hostility is a very interesting problem which,\nhowever, exceeds the scope of this book. We have already referred to the\ninfantile father-complex; we may add that an investigation of the early\nhistory of kingship would bring the decisive explanations. Frazer has an\nimpressive discussion of the theory that the first kings were strangers\nwho, after a short reign, were destined to be sacrificed at solemn\nfestivals as representatives of the deity; but Frazer himself does not\nconsider his facts altogether convincing[66]. Christian myths are said\nto have been still influenced by the after-effects of this evolution of\nkings.\n(_C_) THE TABOO OF THE DEAD\nWe know that the dead are mighty rulers: we may be surprised to learn\nthat they are regarded as enemies.\nAmong most primitive people the taboo of the dead displays, if we may\nkeep to our infection analogy, a peculiar virulence. It manifests itself\nin the first place, in the consequences which result from contact with\nthe dead, and in the treatment of the mourners for the dead. Among the\nMaori any one who had touched a corpse or who had taken part in its\ninterment, became extremely unclean and was almost cut off from\nintercourse with his fellow beings; he was, as we say, boycotted. He\ncould not enter a house, or approach persons or objects without\ninfecting them with the same properties. He could not even touch his\nfood with his own hands, which were now unclean and therefore quite\nuseless to him. His food was put on the ground and he had no alternative\nexcept to seize it as best he could, with his lips and teeth, while he\nheld his hands behind on his back. Occasionally he could be fed by\nanother person who helped him to his food with outstretched arms so as\nnot to touch the unfortunate one himself, but this assistant was then in\nturn subjected to almost equally oppressive restrictions. Almost every\nvillage contained some altogether disreputable individual, ostracized by\nsociety, whose wretched existence depended upon people\u2019s charity. This\ncreature alone was allowed within arm\u2019s length of a person who had\nfulfilled the last duty towards the deceased. But as soon as the period\nof segregation was over and the person rendered unclean through the\ncorpse could again mingle with his fellow-beings, all the dishes which\nhe had used during the dangerous period were broken and all his clothing\nwas thrown away.\nThe taboo customs after bodily contact with the dead are the same all\nover Polynesia, in Melanesia, and in a part of Africa; their most\nconstant feature is the prohibition against handling one\u2019s food and the\nconsequent necessity of being fed by somebody else. It is noteworthy\nthat in Polynesia, or perhaps only in Hawaii[67], priest-kings were\nsubject to the same restrictions during the exercise of holy functons.\nIn the taboo of the dead on the Island of Tonga the abatement and\ngradual abolition of the prohibitions through the individual\u2019s own\ntaboo power are clearly shown. A person who touched the corpse of a dead\nchieftain was unclean for ten months; but if he was himself a chief, he\nwas unclean for only three, four, or five months, according to the rank\nof the deceased; if it was the corpse of the idolized head-chief even\nthe greatest chiefs became taboo for ten months. These savages are so\ncertain that any one who violates these taboo rules must become\nseriously ill and die, that according to the opinion of an observer,\nthey have never yet dared to convince themselves of the contrary[68].\nThe taboo restrictions imposed upon persons whose contact with the dead\nis to be understood in the transferred sense, namely the mourning\nrelatives such as widows and widowers, are essentially the same as those\nmentioned above, but they are of greater interest for the point we are\ntrying to make. In the rules hitherto mentioned we see only the typical\nexpression of the virulence and power of diffusion of the taboo; in\nthose about to be cited we catch a gleam of the motives, including both\nthe ostensible ones and those which may be regarded as the underlying\nand genuine motives.\nAmong the Shuswap in British-Columbia widows and widowers have to\nremain segregated during their period of mourning; they must not use\ntheir hands to touch the body or the head and all utensils used by them\nmust not be used by any one else. No hunter will want to approach the\nhut in which such mourners live, for that would bring misfortune; if the\nshadow of one of the mourners should fall on him he would become ill.\nThe mourners sleep on thorn bushes, with which they also surround their\nbeds. This last precaution is meant to keep off the spirit of the\ndeceased; plainer still is the reported custom of other North American\ntribes where the widow, after the death of her husband, has to wear a\nkind of trousers of dried grass in order to make herself inaccessible to\nthe approach of the spirit. Thus it is quite obvious that touching \u2018in\nthe transferred sense\u2019 is after all understood only as bodily contact,\nsince the spirit of the deceased does not leave his kin and does not\ndesist from \u2018hovering about them\u2019, during the period of mourning.\nAmong the Agutainos, who live on Palawan, one of the Philippine Islands,\na widow may not leave her hut for the first seven or eight days after\nher husband\u2019s death, except at night, when she need not expect\nencounters. Whoever sees her is in danger of immediate death and\ntherefore she herself warns others of her approach by hitting the trees\nwith a wooden stick with every step she takes; these trees all wither.\nAnother observation explains the nature of the danger inherent in a\nwidow. In the district of Mekeo, British New Guinea, a widower forfeits\nall civil rights and lives like an outlaw. He may not tend a garden, or\nshow himself in public, or enter the village or go on the street. He\nslinks about like an animal, in the high grass or in the bushes, and\nmust hide in a thicket if he sees anybody, especially a woman,\napproaching. This last hint makes it easy for us to trace back the\ndanger of the widower or widow to the danger of temptation. The husband\nwho has lost his wife must evade the desire for a substitute; the widow\nhas to contend with the same wish, and beside this, she may arouse the\ndesire of other men because she is without a master. Every such\nsatisfaction through a substitute runs contrary to the intention of\nmourning and would cause the anger of the spirit to flare up[69].\nOne of the most surprising, but at the same time one of the most\ninstructive taboo customs of mourning among primitive races is the\nprohibition against pronouncing the _name_ of the deceased. This is\nvery widespread, and has been subjected to many modifications with\nimportant consequences.\nAside from the Australians and the Polynesians, who usually show us\ntaboo customs in their best state of preservation, we also find this\nprohibition among races so far apart and unrelated to each other as the\nSamojedes in Siberia and the Todas in South India, the Mongolians of\nTartary and the Tuaregs of the Sahara, the Aino of Japan and the Akamba\nand Nandi in Central Africa, the Tinguanes in the Philippines and the\ninhabitants of the Nikobari Islands and of Madagascar and Borneo[70].\nAmong some of these races the prohibition and its consequences hold good\nonly for the period of mourning while in others it remains permanent;\nbut in all cases it seems to diminish with the lapse of time after the\ndeath.\nThe avoidance of the name of the deceased is as a rule kept up with\nextraordinary severity. Thus, among many South American tribes, it is\nconsidered the gravest insult to the survivors to pronounce the name of\nthe deceased in their presence, and the penalty set for it is no less\nthan that for the slaying itself[71]. At first it is not easy to guess\nwhy the mention of the name should be so abominated, but the dangers\nassociated with it have called into being a whole series of interesting\nand important expedients to avoid this. Thus the Masai in Africa have\nhit upon the evasion of changing the name of the deceased immediately\nupon his death; he may now be mentioned without dread by this new name,\nwhile all the prohibitions remain attached to the old name. It seems to\nbe assumed that the ghost does not know his new name and will not find\nit out. The Australian tribes on Adelaide and Encounter Bay are so\nconsistently cautious that when a death occurs almost every person who\nhas the same name as the deceased or a very similar one, exchanges it\nfor another. Sometimes by a further extension of the same idea as seen\namong several tribes in Victoria and in North America all the relatives\nof the deceased change their names regardless of whether their names\nresemble the name of the deceased in sound. Among the Guaycuru in\nParaguay the chief used to give new names to all the members of the\ntribe, on such sad occasions, which they then remembered as if they had\nalways had them[72].\nFurthermore, if the deceased had the same name as an animal or object,\netc., some of the races just enumerated thought it necessary to give\nthese animals and objects new names, in order not to be reminded of the\ndeceased when they mentioned them. Through this there must have resulted\na never ceasing change of vocabulary, which caused a good deal of\ndifficulty for the missionaries, especially where the interdiction upon\na name was permanent. In the seven years which the missionary\nDobrizhofer spent among the Abipons in Paraguay, the name for jaguar was\nchanged three times and the words for crocodile, thorns and animal\nslaughter underwent a similar fate[73]. But the dread of pronouncing a\nname which has belonged to a deceased person extends also to the mention\nof everything in which the deceased had any part, and a further\nimportant result of this process of suppression is that these races have\nno tradition or any historical reminiscences, so that we encounter the\ngreatest difficulties in investigating their past history. Among a\nnumber of these primitive races compensating customs have also been\nestablished in order to re-awaken the names of the deceased after a long\nperiod of mourning; they are bestowed upon children who were regarded as\nreincarnations of the dead.\nThe strangeness of this taboo on names diminishes if we bear in mind\nthat the savage looks upon his name as an essential part and an\nimportant possession of his personality, and that he ascribes the full\nsignificance of things to words. Our children do the same, as I have\nshown elsewhere, and therefore they are never satisfied with accepting a\nmeaningless verbal similarity, but consistently conclude that when two\nthings have identical names a deeper correspondence between them must\nexist. Numerous peculiarities of normal behaviour may lead civilized man\nto conclude that he too is not yet as far removed as he thinks from\nattributing the importance of things to mere names and feeling that his\nname has become peculiarly identified with his person. This is\ncorroborated by psychoanalytic experiences, where there is much occasion\nto point out the importance of names in unconscious thought\nactivity[74]. As was to be expected, the compulsion neurotics behave\njust like savages in regard to names. They show the full \u2018complex\nsensitiveness\u2019 towards the utterance and hearing of special words (as do\nalso other neurotics) and derive a good many, often serious, inhibitions\nfrom their treatment of their own name. One of these taboo patients whom\nI knew, had adopted the avoidance of writing down her name for fear that\nit might get into somebody\u2019s hands who thus would come into possession\nof a piece of her personality. In her frenzied faithfulness, which she\nneeded to protect herself against the temptations of her phantasy, she\nhad created for herself the commandment, \u2018not to give away anything of\nher personality\u2019. To this belonged first of all her name, then by\nfurther application her hand-writing, so that she finally gave up\nwriting.\nThus it no longer seems strange to us that savages should consider a\ndead person\u2019s name as a part of his personality and that it should be\nsubjected to the same taboo as the deceased. Calling a dead person by\nname can also be traced back to contact with him, so that we can turn\nour attention to the more inclusive problem of why this contact is\nvisited with such a severe taboo.\nThe nearest explanation would point to the natural horror which a corpse\ninspires, especially in view of the changes so soon noticeable after\ndeath. Mourning for a dead person must also be considered as a\nsufficient motive for everything which has reference to him. But horror\nof the corpse evidently does not cover all the details of taboo rules,\nand mourning can never explain to us why the mention of the dead is a\nsevere insult to his survivors. On the contrary, mourning loves to\npreoccupy itself with the deceased, to elaborate his memory, and\npreserve it for the longest possible time. Something besides mourning\nmust be made responsible for the peculiarities of taboo customs,\nsomething which evidently serves a different purpose. It is this very\ntaboo on names which reveals this still unknown motive, and if the\ncustoms did not tell us about it we would find it out from the\nstatements of the mourning savages themselves.\nFor they do not conceal the fact that they fear the presence and the\nreturn of the spirit of a dead person; they practise a host of\nceremonies to keep him off and banish him[75]. They look upon the\nmention of his name as a conjuration which must result in his immediate\npresence[76]. They therefore consistently do everything to avoid\nconjuring and awakening a dead person. They disguise themselves in order\nthat the spirit may not recognize them[77], they distort either his name\nor their own, and become infuriated when a ruthless stranger incites the\nspirit against his survivors by mentioning his name. We can hardly avoid\nthe conclusion that they suffer, according to Wundt\u2019s expression, from\nthe fear of \u201chis soul now turned into a demon,\u201d[78].\nWith this understanding we approach Wundt\u2019s conception who, as we have\nheard, sees the nature of taboo in the fear of demons.\nThe assumption which this theory makes, namely, that immediately after\ndeath the beloved member of a family becomes a demon, from whom the\nsurvivors have nothing but hostility to expect, so that they must\nprotect themselves by every means from his evil desires, is so peculiar\nthat our first impulse is not to believe it. Yet almost all competent\nauthors agree as to this interpretation of primitive races.\nWestermarck[79], who, in my opinion, gives altogether too little\nconsideration to taboo, makes this statement: \u201cOn the whole facts lead\nme to conclude that the dead are more frequently regarded as enemies\nthan as friends and that Jevons and Grant Allen are wrong in their\nassertion that it was formerly believed that the malevolence of the dead\nwas as a rule directed only against strangers, while they were\npaternally concerned about the life and welfare of their descendants\nand the members of their clan.\u201d\nR. Kleinpaul has written an impressive book in which he makes use of the\nremnants of the old belief in souls among civilized races to show the\nrelation between the living and the dead[80]. According to him too, this\nrelation culminates in the conviction that the dead, thirsting for\nblood, draw the living after them. The living did not feel themselves\nsafe from the persecutions of the dead until a body of water had been\nput between them. That is why it was preferred to bury the dead on\nislands or to bring them to the other side of a river: the expressions\n\u2018here\u2019 and \u2018beyond\u2019 originated in this way. Later moderation has\nrestricted the malevolence of the dead to those categories where a\npeculiar right to feel rancour had to be admitted, such as the murdered\nwho pursue their murderer as evil spirits, and those who, like brides,\nhad died with their longings unsatisfied. Kleinpaul believes that\noriginally, however, the dead were all vampires, who bore ill-will to\nthe living, and strove to harm them and deprive them of life. It was the\ncorpse that first furnished the conception of an evil spirit.\nThe hypothesis that those whom we love best turn into demons after\ndeath obviously allows us to put a further question. What prompted\nprimitive races to ascribe such a change of sentiment to the beloved\ndead? Why did they make demons out of them? According to Westermarck\nthis question is easily answered[81]. \u201cAs death is usually considered\nthe worst calamity that can overtake man, it is believed that the\ndeceased are very dissatisfied with their lot. Primitive races believe\nthat death comes only through being slain, whether by violence or by\nmagic, and this is considered already sufficient reason for the soul to\nbe vindictive and irritable. The soul presumably envies the living and\nlongs for the company of its former kin; we can therefore understand\nthat the soul should seek to kill with them diseases in order to be\nre-united with them....\n\u201c ...A further explanation of the malevolence ascribed to souls lies in\nthe instinctive fear of them, which is itself the result of the fear of\ndeath.\u201d\nOur study of psychoneurotic disturbances points to a more comprehensive\nexplanation, which includes that of Westermarck.\nWhen a wife loses her husband, or a daughter her mother, it not\ninfrequently happens that the survivor is afflicted with tormenting\nscruples, called \u2018obsessive reproaches\u2019 which raises the question\nwhether she herself has not been guilty through carelessness or neglect,\nof the death of the beloved person. No recalling of the care with which\nshe nursed the invalid, or direct refutation of the asserted guilt can\nput an end to the torture, which is the pathological expression of\nmourning and which in time slowly subsides. Psychoanalytic investigation\nof such cases has made us acquainted with the secret mainsprings of this\naffliction. We have ascertained that these obsessive reproaches are in a\ncertain sense justified and therefore are immune to refutation or\nobjections. Not that the mourner has really been guilty of the death or\nthat she has really been careless, as the obsessive reproach asserts;\nbut still there was something in her, a wish of which she herself was\nunaware, which was not displeased with the fact that death came, and\nwhich would have brought it about sooner had it been strong enough. The\nreproach now reacts against this unconscious wish after the death of the\nbeloved person. Such hostility, hidden in the unconscious behind tender\nlove, exists in almost all cases of intensive emotional allegiance to a\nparticular person, indeed it represents the classic case, the prototype\nof the ambivalence of human emotions. There is always more or less of\nthis ambivalence in everybody\u2019s disposition; normally it is not strong\nenough to give rise to the obsessive reproaches we have described. But\nwhere there is abundant predisposition for it, it manifests itself in\nthe relation to those we love most, precisely where you would least\nexpect it. The disposition to compulsion neurosis which we have so often\ntaken for comparison with taboo problems, is distinguished by a\nparticularly high degree of this original ambivalence of emotions.\nWe now know how to explain the supposed demonism of recently departed\nsouls and the necessity of being protected against their hostility\nthrough taboo rules. By assuming a similar high degree of ambivalence in\nthe emotional life of primitive races such as psychoanalysis ascribes to\npersons suffering from compulsion neurosis, it becomes comprehensible\nthat the same kind of reaction against the hostility latent in the\nunconscious behind the obsessive reproaches of the neurotic should also\nbe necessary here after the painful loss has occurred. But this\nhostility which is painfully felt in the unconscious in the form of\nsatisfaction with the demise, experiences a different fate in the case\nof primitive man: the defence against it is accomplished by displacement\nupon the object of hostility, namely the dead. We call this defence\nprocess, frequent both in normal and diseased psychic life, a\n_projection_. The survivor will deny that he has ever entertained\nhostile impulses toward the beloved dead; but now the soul of the\ndeceased entertains them and will try to give vent to them during the\nentire period of mourning. In spite of the successful defence through\nprojection, the punitive and remorseful character of this emotional\nreaction manifests itself in being afraid, in self-imposed renunciations\nand in subjection to restrictions which are partly disguised as\nprotective measures against the hostile demon. Thus we find again that\ntaboo has grown out of the soil of an ambivalent emotional attitude. The\ntaboo of the dead also originates from the opposition between the\nconscious grief and the unconscious satisfaction at death. If this is\nthe origin of the resentment of spirits it is self-evident that just the\nnearest and formerly most beloved survivors have to fear it most.\nAs in neurotic symptoms, the taboo regulations also evince opposite\nfeelings. Their restrictive character expresses mourning, while they\nalso betray very clearly what they are trying to conceal, namely, the\nhostility towards the dead, which is now motivated as self-defence. We\nhave learnt to understand part of the taboo regulations as temptation\nfears. A dead person is defenceless, which must act as an incitement to\nsatisfy hostile desires entertained against him; this temptation has to\nbe opposed by the prohibition.\nBut Westermarck is right in not admitting any difference in the savage\u2019s\nconception between those who have died by violence and those who have\ndied a natural death. As will be shown later[82], in the unconscious\nmode of thinking even a natural death is perceived as murder; the person\nwas killed by evil wishes. Any one interested in the origin and meaning\nof dreams dealing with the death of dear relatives such as parents and\nbrothers and sisters will find that the same feeling of ambivalence is\nresponsible for the fact that the dreamer, the child, and the savage all\nhave the same attitude towards the dead[83].\nA little while ago we challenged Wundt\u2019s conception, who explains the\nnature of taboo through the fear of demons, and yet we have just agreed\nwith the explanation which traces back the taboo of the dead to a fear\nof the soul of the dead after it has turned into a demon. This seems\nlike a contradiction, but it will not be difficult for us to explain it.\nIt is true that we have accepted the idea of demons, but we know that\nthis assumption is not something final which psychology cannot resolve\ninto further elements. We have, as it were, exposed the demons by\nrecognizing them as mere projections of hostile feelings which the\nsurvivor entertains towards the dead.\nThe double feeling--tenderness and hostility--against the deceased,\nwhich we consider well founded, endeavours to assert itself at the time\nof bereavement as mourning and satisfaction. A conflict must ensue\nbetween these contrary feelings, and as one of them, namely the\nhostility, is altogether or for the greater part unconscious, the\nconflict cannot result in a conscious difference in the form of\nhostility or tenderness as, for instance, when we forgive an injury\ninflicted upon us by some one we love. The process usually adjusts\nitself through a special psychic mechanism, which is designated in\npsychoanalysis as _projection_. This unknown hostility, of which we are\nignorant and of which we do not wish to know, is projected from our\ninner perception into the outer world and is thereby detached from our\nown person and attributed to the other. Not we, the survivors, rejoice\nbecause we are rid of the deceased, on the contrary, we mourn for him;\nbut now, curiously enough, he has become an evil demon who would rejoice\nin our misfortune and who seeks our death. The survivors must now defend\nthemselves against this evil enemy; they are freed from inner\noppression, but they have only succeeded in exchanging it for an\naffliction from without.\nIt is not to be denied that this process of projection, which turns the\ndead into malevolent enemies, finds some support in the real hostilities\nof the dead which the survivors remember and with which they really can\nreproach the dead. These hostilities are harshness, the desire to\ndominate, injustice, and whatever else forms the background of even the\nmost tender relations between men. But the process cannot be so simple\nthat this factor alone could explain the origin of demons by projection.\nThe offences of the dead certainly motivate in part the hostility of the\nsurvivors, but they would have been ineffective if they had not given\nrise to this hostility and the occasion of death would surely be the\nleast suitable occasion for awakening the memory of the reproaches which\njustly could have been brought against the deceased. We cannot dispense\nwith the unconscious hostility as the constant and really impelling\nmotive. This hostile tendency towards those nearest and dearest could\nremain latent during their lifetime, that is to say, it could avoid\nbetraying itself to consciousness either directly or indirectly through\nany substitutive formation. However, when the person who was\nsimultaneously loved and hated died, this was no longer possible, and\nthe conflict became acute. The mourning originating from the enhanced\ntenderness, became on the one hand more intolerant of the latent\nhostility, while on the other hand it could not tolerate that the latter\nshould not give origin to a feeling of pure gratification. Thus there\ncame about the repression of the unconscious hostility through\nprojection, and the formation of the ceremonial in which fear of\npunishment by demons finds expression. With the termination of the\nperiod of mourning, the conflict also loses its acuteness so that the\ntaboo of the dead can be abated or sink into oblivion.\n4\nHaving thus explained the basis on which the very instructive taboo of\nthe dead has grown up, we must not miss the opportunity of adding a few\nobservations which may become important for the understanding of taboo\nin general.\nThe projection of unconscious hostility upon demons in the taboo of the\ndead is only a single example from a whole series of processes to which\nwe must grant the greatest influence in the formation of primitive\npsychic life. In the foregoing case the mechanism of projection is used\nto settle an emotional conflict; it serves the same purpose in a large\nnumber of psychic situations which lead to neuroses. But projection is\nnot specially created for the purpose of defence, it also comes into\nbeing where there are no conflicts. The projection of inner perceptions\nto the outside is a primitive mechanism which, for instance, also\ninfluences our sense-perceptions, so that it normally has the greatest\nshare in shaping our outer world. Under conditions that have not yet\nbeen sufficiently determined even inner perceptions of ideational and\nemotional processes are projected outwardly, like sense perceptions, and\nare used to shape the outer world, whereas they ought to remain in the\ninner world. This is perhaps genetically connected with the fact that\nthe function of attention was originally directed not towards the inner\nworld, but to the stimuli streaming in from the outer world, and only\nreceived reports of pleasure and pain from the endopsychic processes.\nOnly with the development of the language of abstract thought through\nthe association of sensory remnants of word representations with inner\nprocesses, did the latter gradually become capable of perception. Before\nthis took place primitive man had developed a picture of the outer world\nthrough the outward projection of inner perceptions, which we, with our\nreinforced conscious perception, must now translate back into\npsychology.\nThe projection of their own evil impulses upon demons is only a part of\nwhat has become the world system (\u2018Weltanschauung\u2019) of primitive man\nwhich we shall discuss later as \u2018animism\u2019. We shall then have to\nascertain the psychological nature of such a system formation and the\npoints of support which we shall find in the analysis of these system\nformations will again bring us face to face with the neurosis. For the\npresent we merely wish to suggest that the \u2018secondary elaboration\u2019 of\nthe dream content is the prototype of all these system formations[84].\nAnd let us not forget that beginning at the stage of system formation\nthere are two origins for every act judged by consciousness, namely the\nsystematic, and the real but unconscious origin[85].\nWundt[86] remarks that \u201camong the influences which myth everywhere\nascribes to demons the evil ones preponderate, so that according to the\nreligions of races evil demons are evidently older than good demons.\u201d\nNow it is quite possible that the whole conception of demons was derived\nfrom the extremely important relation to the dead. In the further course\nof human development the ambivalence inherent in this relation then\nmanifested itself by allowing two altogether contrary psychic formations\nto issue from the same root, namely, the fear of demons and of\n_ghosts_, and the reverence for ancestors[87]. Nothing testifies so much\nto the influence of mourning on the origin of belief in demons as the\nfact that demons were always taken to be the spirits of persons not long\ndead. Mourning has a very distinct psychic task to perform, namely, to\ndetach the memories and expectations of the survivors from the dead.\nWhen this work is accomplished the grief, and with it the remorse and\nreproach, lessens, and therefore also the fear of the demon. But the\nvery spirits which at first were feared as demons now serve a friendlier\npurpose; they are revered as ancestors and appealed to for help in times\nof distress.\nIf we survey the relation of survivors to the dead through the course of\nthe ages, it is very evident that the ambivalent feeling has\nextraordinarily abated. We now find it easy to suppress whatever\nunconscious hostility towards the dead there may still exist without any\nspecial psychic effort on our part. Where formerly satisfied hate and\npainful tenderness struggled with each other, we now find piety, which\nappears like a cicatrice and demands: _De mortuis nil nisi_ _bene_.\nOnly neurotics still blur the mourning for the loss of their dear ones\nwith attacks of compulsive reproaches which psychoanalysis reveals as\nthe old ambivalent emotional feeling. How this change was brought about,\nand to what extent constitutional changes and real improvement of\nfamiliar relations share in causing the abatement of the ambivalent\nfeeling, need not be discussed here. But this example would lead us to\nassume _that the psychic impulses of primitive man possessed a higher\ndegree of ambivalence than is found at present among civilized human\nbeings. With the decline of this ambivalence the taboo, as the\ncompromise symptom of the ambivalent conflict, also slowly disappeared._\nNeurotics who are compelled to reproduce this conflict, together with\nthe taboo resulting from it, may be said to have brought with them an\natavistic remnant in the form of an archaic constitution the\ncompensation of which in the interest of cultural demands entails the\nmost prodigious psychic efforts on their part.\nAt this point we may recall the confusing information which Wundt\noffered us about the double meaning of the word taboo, namely, holy and\nunclean (see above). It was supposed that originally the word taboo did\nnot yet mean holy and unclean but signified something demonic, something\nwhich may not be touched, thus emphasizing a characteristic common to\nboth extremes of the later conception; this persistent common trait\nproves, however, that an original correspondence existed between what\nwas holy and what was unclean, which only later became differentiated.\nIn contrast to this, our discussion readily shows that the double\nmeaning in question belonged to the word taboo from the very beginning\nand that it serves to designate a definite ambivalence as well as\neverything which has come into existence on the basis of this\nambivalence. Taboo is itself an ambivalent word and by way of supplement\nwe may add that the established meaning of this word might of itself\nhave allowed us to guess what we have found as the result of extensive\ninvestigation, namely, that the taboo prohibition is to be explained as\nthe result of an emotional ambivalence. A study of the oldest languages\nhas taught us that at one time there were many such words which included\ntheir own contrasts so that they were in a certain sense ambivalent,\nthough perhaps not exactly in the same sense as the word taboo[88].\nSlight vocal modifications of this primitive word containing two\nopposite meanings later served to create a separate linguistic\nexpression for the two opposites originally united in one word.\nThe word taboo has had a different fate; with the diminished importance\nof the ambivalence which it connotes it has itself disappeared, or\nrather, the words analogous to it have vanished from the vocabulary. In\na later connection I hope to be able to show that a tangible historic\nchange is probably concealed behind the fate of this conception; that\nthe word at first was associated with definite human relations which\nwere characterized by great emotional ambivalence from which it expanded\nto other analogous relations.\nUnless we are mistaken, the understanding of taboo also throws light\nupon the nature and origin of _conscience_. Without stretching ideas we\ncan speak of a taboo conscience and a taboo sense of guilt after the\nviolation of a taboo. Taboo conscience is probably the oldest form in\nwhich we meet the phenomenon of conscience.\nFor what is \u2018conscience\u2019? According to linguistic testimony it belongs\nto what we know most surely; in some languages its meaning is hardly to\nbe distinguished from consciousness.\nConscience is the inner perception of objections to definite wish\nimpulses that exist in us; but the emphasis is put upon the fact that\nthis rejection does not have to depend on anything else, that it is\nsure of itself. This becomes even plainer in the case of a guilty\nconscience, where we become aware of the inner condemnation of such acts\nwhich realized some of our definite wish impulses. Confirmation seems\nsuperfluous here; whoever has a conscience must feel in himself the\njustification of the condemnation, and the reproach for the accomplished\naction. But this same character is evinced by the attitude of savages\ntowards taboo. Taboo is a command of conscience, the violation of which\ncauses a terrible sense of guilt which is as self-evident as its origin\nis unknown[89].\nIt is therefore probable that conscience also originates on the basis of\nan ambivalent feeling from quite definite human relations which contain\nthis ambivalence. It probably originates under conditions which are in\nforce both for taboo and the compulsion neurosis, that is, one component\nof the two contrasting feelings is unconscious and is kept repressed by\nthe compulsive domination of the other component. This is confirmed by\nmany things which we have learned from our analysis of neurosis. In the\nfirst place the character of compulsion neurotics shows a predominant\ntrait of painful conscientiousness which is a symptom of reaction\nagainst the temptation which lurks in the unconscious, and which\ndevelops into the highest degrees of guilty conscience as their illness\ngrows worse. Indeed, one may venture the assertion that if the origin of\nguilty conscience could not be discovered through compulsion neurotic\npatients, there would be no prospect of ever discovering it. This task\nis successfully solved in the case of the individual neurotic, and we\nare confident of finding a similar solution in the case of races.\nIn the second place we cannot help noticing that the sense of guilt\ncontains much of the nature of anxiety; without hesitation it may be\ndescribed as \u2018conscience phobia\u2019. But fear points to unconscious\nsources. The psychology of the neuroses taught us that when wish\nfeelings undergo repression their libido becomes transformed into\nanxiety. In addition we must bear in mind that the sense of guilt also\ncontains something unknown and unconscious, namely the motivation for\nthe rejection. The character of anxiety in the sense of guilt\ncorresponds to this unknown quantity.\nIf taboo expresses itself mainly in prohibitions it may well be\nconsidered self-evident, without remote proof from the analogy with\nneurosis that it is based on a positive, desireful impulse. For what\nnobody desires to do does not have to be forbidden, and certainly\nwhatever is expressly forbidden must be an object of desire. If we\napplied this plausible theory to primitive races we would have to\nconclude that among their strongest temptations were desires to kill\ntheir kings and priests, to commit incest, to abuse their dead and the\nlike. That is not very probable. And if we should apply the same theory\nto those cases in which we ourselves seem to hear the voice of\nconscience most clearly we would arouse the greatest contradiction. For\nthere we would assert with the utmost certainty that we did not feel the\nslightest temptation to violate any of these commandments, as for\nexample, the commandment: Thou shalt not kill, and that we felt nothing\nbut repugnance at the very idea.\nBut if we grant the testimony of our conscience the importance it\nclaims, then the prohibition--the taboo as well as our moral\nprohibitions--becomes superfluous, while the existence of a conscience,\nin turn, remains unexplained and the connection between conscience,\ntaboo and neurosis disappears. The net result of this would then be our\npresent state of understanding unless we view the problem\npsychoanalytically.\nBut if we take into account the following results of psychoanalysis, our\nunderstanding of the problem is greatly advanced. The analysis of\ndreams of normal individuals has shown that our own temptation to kill\nothers is stronger and more frequent than we had suspected and that it\nproduces psychic effects even where it does not reveal itself to our\nconsciousness. And when we have learnt that the obsessive rules of\ncertain neurotics are nothing but measures of self-reassurance and\nself-punishment erected against the reinforced impulse to commit murder,\nwe can return with fresh appreciation to our previous hypothesis that\nevery prohibition must conceal a desire. We can then assume that this\ndesire to murder actually exists and that the taboo as well as the moral\nprohibition are psychologically by no means superfluous but are, on the\ncontrary, explained and justified through our ambivalent attitude\ntowards the impulse to slay.\nThe nature of this ambivalent relation so often emphasized as\nfundamental, namely, that the positive underlying desire is unconscious,\nopens the possibility of showing further connections and explaining\nfurther problems. The pyschic processes in the unconscious are not\nentirely identical with those known to us from our conscious psychic\nlife, but have the benefit of certain notable liberties of which the\nlatter are deprived. An unconscious impulse need not have originated\nwhere we find it expressed, it can spring from an entirely different\nplace and may originally have referred to other persons and relations,\nbut through the mechanism of _displacement_, it reaches the point where\nit comes to our notice. Thanks to the indestructibility of unconscious\nprocesses and their inaccessibility to correction, the impulse may be\nsaved over from earlier times to which it was adapted to later periods\nand conditions in which its manifestations must necessarily seem\nforeign. These are all only hints, but a careful elaboration of them\nwould show how important they may become for the understanding of the\ndevelopment of civilization.\nIn closing these discussions we do not want to neglect to make an\nobservation that will be of use for later investigations. Even if we\ninsist upon the essential similarity between taboo and moral\nprohibitions we do not dispute that a psychological difference must\nexist between them. A change in the relations of the fundamental\nambivalence can be the only reason why the prohibition no longer appears\nin the form of a taboo.\nIn the analytical consideration of taboo phenomena we have hitherto\nallowed ourselves to be guided by their demonstrable agreements with\ncompulsion neurosis; but as taboo is not a neurosis but a social\ncreation we are also confronted with the task of showing wherein lies\nthe essential difference between the neurosis and a product of culture\nlike the taboo.\nHere again I will take a single fact as my starting point. Primitive\nraces fear a punishment for the violation of a taboo, usually a serious\ndisease or death. This punishment threatens only him who has been guilty\nof the violation. It is different with the compulsion neurosis. If the\npatient wants to do something that is forbidden to him he does not fear\npunishment for himself, but for another person. This person is usually\nindefinite, but, by means of analysis, is easily recognized as some one\nvery near and dear to the patient. The neurotic therefore acts as if he\nwere altruistic, while primitive man seems egotistical. Only if\nretribution fails to overtake the taboo violator spontaneously does a\ncollective feeling awaken among savages that they are all threatened\nthrough the sacrilege, and they hasten to inflict the omitted punishment\nthemselves. It is easy for us to explain the mechanism of this\nsolidarity. It is a question of fear of the contagious example, the\ntemptation to imitate, that is to say, of the capacity of the taboo to\ninfect. If some one has succeeded in satisfying the repressed desire,\nthe same desire must manifest itself in all his companions; hence, in\norder to keep down this temptation, this envied individual must be\ndespoiled of the fruit of his daring. Not infrequently the punishment\ngives the executors themselves an opportunity to commit the same\nsacrilegious act by justifying it as an expiation. This is really one of\nthe fundamentals of the human code of punishment which rightly presumes\nthe same forbidden impulses in the criminal and in the members of\nsociety who avenge his offence.\nPsychoanalysis here confirms what the pious were wont to say, that we\nare all miserable sinners. How then shall we explain the unexpected\nnobility of the neurosis which fears nothing for itself and everything\nfor the beloved person? Psychoanalytic investigation shows that this\nnobility is not primary. Originally, that is to say at the beginning of\nthe disease, the threat of punishment pertained to one\u2019s own person; in\nevery case the fear was for one\u2019s own life; the fear of death being only\nlater displaced upon another beloved person. The process is somewhat\ncomplicated but we have a complete grasp of it. An evil impulse--a death\nwish--towards the beloved person is always at the basis of the formation\nof a prohibition. This is repressed through a prohibition, and the\nprohibition is connected with a certain act which by displacement\nusually substitutes the hostile for the beloved person, and the\nexecution of this act is threatened with the penalty of death. But the\nprocess goes further and the original wish for the death of the beloved\nother person is then replaced by fear for his death. The tender\naltruistic trait of the neurosis therefore merely _compensates_ for the\nopposite attitude of brutal egotism which is at the basis of it. If we\ndesignate as social those emotional impulses which are determined\nthrough regard for another person who is not taken as a sexual object,\nwe can emphasize the withdrawal of these social factors as an essential\nfeature of the neurosis, which is later disguised through\novercompensation.\nWithout lingering over the origin of these social impulses and their\nrelation to other fundamental impulses of man, we will bring out the\nsecond main characteristic of the neurosis by means of another example.\nThe form in which taboo manifests itself has the greatest similarity to\nthe touching phobia of neurotics, the _D\u00e9lire de toucher_. As a matter\nof fact this neurosis is regularly concerned with the prohibition of\nsexual touching and psychoanalysis has quite generally shown that the\nmotive power which is deflected and displaced in the neurosis is of\nsexual origin. In taboo the forbidden contact has evidently not only\nsexual significance but rather the more, general one of attack, of\nacquisition and of personal assertion. If it is prohibited to touch the\nchief or something that was in contact with him it means that an\ninhibition should be imposed upon the same impulse which on other\noccasions expresses itself in suspicious surveillance of the chief and\neven in physical ill-treatment of him before his coronation (see above).\n_Thus the preponderance of sexual components of the impulse over the\nsocial components is the determining factor of the neurosis._ But the\nsocial impulses themselves came into being through the union of\negotistical and erotic components into special entities.\nFrom this single example of a comparison between taboo and compulsion\nneurosis it is already possible to guess the relation between individual\nforms of the neurosis and the creations of culture, and in what respect\nthe study of the psychology of the neurosis is important for the\nunderstanding of the development of culture.\nIn one way the neuroses show a striking and far-reaching correspondence\nwith the great social productions of art, religion and philosophy, while\nagain they seem like distortions of them. We may say that hysteria is a\ncaricature of an artistic creation, a compulsion neurosis, a caricature\nof a religion, and a paranoic delusion, a caricature of a philosophic\nsystem. In the last analysis this deviation goes back to the fact that\nthe neuroses are asocial formations; they seek to accomplish by private\nmeans what arose in society through collective labour. In analysing the\nimpulse of the neuroses one learns that motive powers of sexual origin\nexercise the determining influence in them, while the corresponding\ncultural creations rest upon social impulses and on such as have issued\nfrom the combination of egotistical and sexual components. It seems that\nthe sexual need is not capable of uniting men in the same way as the\ndemands of self preservation; sexual satisfaction is in the first place\nthe private concern of the individual.\nGenetically the asocial nature of the neurosis springs from its original\ntendency to flee from a dissatisfying reality to a more pleasurable\nworld of phantasy. This real world which neurotics shun is dominated by\nthe society of human beings and by the institutions created by them; the\nestrangement from reality is at the same time a withdrawal from human\ncompanionship.\nCHAPTER III\nANIMISM, MAGIC AND THE OMNIPOTENCE OF THOUGHT\n1\nIt is a necessary defect of studies which seek to apply the point of\nview of psychoanalysis to the mental sciences that they cannot do\njustice to either subject. They therefore confine themselves to the r\u00f4le\nof incentives and make suggestions to the expert which he should take\ninto consideration in his work. This defect will make itself felt most\nstrongly in an essay such as this which tries to treat of the enormous\nsphere called animism[90].\nAnimism in the narrower sense is the theory of psychic concepts, and in\nthe wider sense, of spiritual beings in general. Animatism, the\nanimation theory of seemingly inanimate nature, is a further\nsubdivision which also includes animatism and animism. The name animism,\nformerly applied to a definite philosophic system, seems to have\nacquired its present meaning through E. B. Tylor[91].\nWhat led to the formulation of these names is the insight into the very\nremarkable conceptions of nature and the world of those primitive races\nknown to us from history and from our own times. These races populate\nthe world with a multitude of spiritual beings which are benevolent or\nmalevolent to them, and attribute the causation of natural processes to\nthese spirits and demons; they also consider that not only animals and\nplants, but inanimate things as well are animated by them. A third and\nperhaps the most important part of this primitive \u2018nature philosophy\u2019\nseems far less striking to us because we ourselves are not yet far\nenough removed from it, though we have greatly limited the existence of\nspirits and to-day explain the processes of nature by the assumption of\nimpersonal physical forces. For primitive people believe in a similar\n\u2018animation\u2019 of human individuals as well. Human beings have souls which\ncan leave their habitation and enter into other beings; these souls are\nthe bearers of spiritual activities and are, to a certain extent,\nindependent of the \u2018bodies\u2019. Originally souls were thought of as being\nvery similar to individuals; only in the course of a long evolution did\nthey lose their material character and attain a high degree of\n\u2018spiritualization\u2019[92].\nMost authors incline to the assumption that these soul conceptions are\nthe original nucleus of the animistic system, that spirits merely\ncorrespond to souls that have become independent, and that the souls of\nanimals, plants and things were formed after the analogy of human souls.\nHow did primitive people come to the peculiarly dualistic fundamental\nconceptions on which this animistic system rests? Through the\nobservation, it is thought, of the phenomena of sleep (with dreams) and\ndeath which resemble sleep, and through the effort to explain these\nconditions, which affect each individual so intimately. Above all, the\nproblem of death must have become the starting point of the formation of\nthe theory. To primitive man the continuation of\nlife--immortality--would be self-evident. The conception of death is\nsomething accepted later, and only with hesitation, for even to us it is\nstill devoid of content and unrealizable. Very likely discussions have\ntaken place over the part which may have been played by other\nobservations and experiences in the formation of the fundamental\nanimistic conceptions such as dream imagery, shadows and reflections,\nbut these have led to no conclusion[93].\nIf primitive man reacted to the phenomena that stimulated his reflection\nwith the formation of conceptions of the soul, and then transferred\nthese to objects of the outer world, his attitude will be judged to be\nquite natural and in no way mysterious. In view of the fact that\nanimistic conceptions have been shown to be similar among the most\nvaried races and in all periods, Wundt states that these \u201care the\nnecessary psychological product of the myth-forming consciousness, and\nprimitive animism may be looked upon as the spiritual expression of\nman\u2019s natural state in so far as this is at all accessible to our\nobservation\u201d[94]. Hume has already justified the animation of the\ninanimate in his _Natural History of Religions_, where he said: \u201cThere\nis a universal tendency among mankind to conceive all beings like\nthemselves and to transfer to every object those qualities with which\nthey are familiarly acquainted and of which they are intimately\nconscious\u201d[95].\nAnimism is a system of thought, it gives not only the explanation of a\nsingle phenomenon, but makes it possible to comprehend the totality of\nthe world from one point, as a continuity. Writers maintain that in the\ncourse of time three such systems of thought, three great world systems\ncame into being: the animistic (mythological), the religious, and the\nscientific. Of these animism, the first system is perhaps the most\nconsistent and the most exhaustive, and the one which explains the\nnature of the world in its entirety. This first world system, of mankind\nis now a psychological theory. It would go beyond our scope to show how\nmuch of it can still be demonstrated in the life of to-day, either as a\nworthless survival in the form of superstition, or in living form, as\nthe foundation of our language, our belief, and our philosophy.\nIt is in reference to the successive stages of these three world systems\nthat we say that animism in itself was not yet a religion but contained\nthe prerequisites from which religions were later formed. It is also\nevident that myths are based upon animistic foundations, but the\ndetailed relation of myths to animism seem unexplained in some essential\npoints.\n2\nOur psychoanalytic work will begin at a different point. It must not be\nassumed that mankind came to create its first world system through a\npurely speculative thirst for knowledge. The practical need of mastering\nthe world must have contributed to this effort. We are therefore not\nastonished to learn that something else went hand in hand with the\nanimistic system, namely the elaboration of directions for making\noneself master of men, animals and things, as well as of their spirits.\nS. Reinach[96] wants to call these directions, which are known under the\nnames of \u2018sorcery and magic\u2019, the strategy of animism; With Mauss and\nHubert, I should prefer to compare them to a technique[97].\nCan the conceptions of sorcery and magic be separated? It can be done if\nwe are willing on our own authority to put ourselves above the vagaries\nof linguistic usage. Then sorcery is essentially the art of influencing\nspirits by treating them like people under the same circumstances, that\nis to say by appeasing them, reconciling them, making them more\nfavourably disposed to one, by intimidating them, by depriving them of\ntheir power and by making them subject to one\u2019s will; all that is\naccomplished through the same methods that have been found effective\nwith living people. Magic, however, is something else; it does not\nessentially concern itself with spirits, and uses special means, not\nthe ordinary psychological method. We can easily guess that magic is the\nearlier and the more important part of animistic technique, for among\nthe means with which spirits are to be treated there are also found the\nmagic kind[98], and magic is also applied where spiritualization of\nnature has not yet, as it seems to us, been accomplished.\nMagic must serve the most varied purposes. It must subject the processes\nof nature to the will of man, protect the individual against enemies and\ndangers, and give him the power to injure his enemies. But the\nprinciples on whose assumptions the magic activity is based, or rather\nthe principle of magic, is so evident that it was recognized by all\nauthors. If we may take the opinion of E. B. Tylor at its face value it\ncan be most tersely expressed in his words: \u201cmistaking an ideal\nconnection for a real one\u201d. We shall explain this characteristic in the\ncase of two groups of magic acts.\nOne of the most widespread magic procedures for injuring an enemy\nconsists of making an effigy of him out of any kind of material. The\nlikeness counts for little, in fact any object may be \u2018named\u2019 as his\nimage. Whatever is subsequently done to this image will also happen to\nthe hated prototype; thus if the effigy has been injured in any place he\nwill be afflicted by a disease in the corresponding part of the body.\nThis same magic technique, instead of being used for private enmity can\nalso be employed for pious purposes and can thus be used to aid the gods\nagainst evil demons. I quote Frazer[99]: \u201cEvery night when the sun-god\nRa in ancient Egypt sank to his home in the glowing west he was assailed\nby hosts of demons under the leadership of the archfiend Apepi. All\nnight long he fought them, and sometimes by day the powers of darkness\nsent up clouds even into the blue Egyptian sky to obscure his light and\nweaken his power. To aid the sun-god in this daily struggle, a ceremony\nwas daily performed in his temple at Thebes. A figure of his foe Apepi,\nrepresented as a crocodile with a hideous face or a serpent with many\ncoils, was made of wax, and on it the demon\u2019s name was written in green\nink. Wrapt in a papyrus case, on which another likeness of Apepi had\nbeen drawn in green ink, the figure was then tied up with black hair,\nspat upon, hacked with a stone knife and cast on the ground. There the\npriest trod on it with his left foot again and again, and then burned it\nin a fire made of a certain plant or grass. When Apepi himself had thus\nbeen effectively disposed of, waxen effigies of each of his principle\ndemons, and of their fathers, mothers, and children, were made and burnt\nin the same way. The service accompanied by the recitation of certain\nprescribed spells, was repeated not merely morning, noon and night, but\nwhenever a storm was raging or heavy rain had set in, or black clouds\nwere stealing across the sky to hide the sun\u2019s bright disk. The fiends\nof darkness, clouds and rain, felt the injury inflicted on their images\nas if it had been done to themselves; they passed away, at least for a\ntime, and the beneficent sun-god shone out triumphant once more\u201d[100].\nThere is a great mass of magic actions which show a similar motivation,\nbut I shall lay stress upon only two, which have always played a great\nr\u00f4le among primitive races and which have been partly preserved in the\nmyths and cults of higher stages of evolution: the art of causing rain\nand fruitfulness by magic. Rain is produced by magic means, by imitating\nit, and perhaps also by imitating the clouds and storm which produce it.\nIt looks as if they wanted to \u2018play rain\u2019. The Ainos of Japan, for\ninstance, make rain by pouring out water through a big sieve, while\nothers fit out a big bowl with sails and oars as if it were a ship,\nwhich is then dragged about the village and gardens. But the\nfruitfulness of the soil was assured by magic means by showing it the\nspectacle of human sexual intercourse. To cite one out of many examples;\nin some part of Java, the peasants used to go out into the fields at\nnight for sexual intercourse when the rice was about to blossom in order\nto stimulate the rice to fruitfulness through their example[101]. At the\nsame time it was feared that proscribed incestuous relationships would\nstimulate the soil to grow weeds and render it unfruitful[102].\nCertain negative rules, that is to say magic precautions, must be put\ninto this first group. If some of the inhabitants of a Dayak village had\nset out on a hunt for wild-boars, those remaining behind were in the\nmeantime not permitted to touch either oil or water with their hands, as\nsuch acts would soften the hunters\u2019 fingers and would let the quarry\nslip through their hands[103]. Or when a Gilyak hunter was pursuing game\nin the woods, his children were forbidden to make drawings on wood or in\nthe sand, as the paths in the thick woods might become as intertwined as\nthe lines of the drawing and the hunter would not find his way\nhome[104].\nThe fact that in these as in a great many other examples of magic\ninfluence, distance plays no part, telepathy is taken as a matter of\ncourse--will cause us no difficulties in grasping the peculiarity of\nmagic.\nThere is no doubt about what is considered the effective force in all\nthese examples. It is the _similarity_ between the performed action and\nthe expected happening. Frazer therefore calls this kind of magic\n_imitative_ or _hom\u0153opathic_. If I want it to rain I only have to\nproduce something that looks like rain or recalls rain. In a later phase\nof cultural development, instead of these magic conjurations of rain,\nprocessions are arranged to a house of god, in order to supplicate the\nsaint who dwells there to send rain. Finally also this religious\ntechnique will be given up and instead an effort will be made to find\nout what would influence the atmosphere to produce rain.\nIn another group of magic actions the principle of similarity is no\nlonger involved, but in its stead there is another principle the nature\nof which is well brought out in the following examples.\nAnother method may be used to injure an enemy. You possess yourself of\nhis hair, his nails, anything that he has discarded, or even a part of\nhis clothing, and do something hostile to these things. This is just as\neffective as if you had dominated the person himself, and anything that\nyou do to the things that belong to him must happen to him too.\nAccording to the conception of primitive men a name is an essential part\nof a personality; if therefore you know the name of a person or a spirit\nyou have acquired a certain power over its bearer. This explains the\nremarkable precautions and restrictions in the use of names which we\nhave touched upon in the essay on taboo[105]. In these examples\nsimilarity is evidently replaced by relationship.\nThe cannibalism of primitive races derives its more sublime motivation\nin a similar manner. By absorbing parts of the body of a person through\nthe act of eating we also come to possess the properties which belonged\nto that person. From this there follow precautions and restrictions as\nto diet under special circumstances. Thus a pregnant woman will avoid\neating the meat of certain animals because their undesirable properties,\nfor example, cowardice, might thus be transferred to the child she is\nnourishing. It makes no difference to the magic influence whether the\nconnection is already abolished or whether it had consisted of only one\nvery important contact. Thus, for instance, the belief in a magic bond\nwhich links the fate of a wound with the weapon which caused it can be\nfollowed unchanged through thousands of years. If a Melanesian gets\npossession of the bow by which he was wounded he will carefully keep it\nin a cool place in order thus to keep down the inflammation of the\nwound. But if the bow has remained in the possession of the enemy it\nwill certainly be kept in close proximity to a fire in order that the\nwound may burn and become thoroughly inflamed. Pliny, in his _Natural\nHistory_, <small>XXVIII</small>, advises spitting on the hand which has caused the\ninjury if one regrets having injured some one; the pain of the injured\nperson will then immediately be eased. Francis Bacon, in his _Natural\nHistory_, mentions the generally accredited belief that putting a salve\non the weapon which has made a wound will cause this wound to heal of\nitself. It is said that even to-day English peasants follow this\nprescription, and that if they have cut themselves with a scythe they\nwill from that moment on carefully keep the instrument clean in order\nthat the wound may not fester. In June, 1902, a local English weekly\nreported that a woman called Matilde Henry of Norwich accidentally ran\nan iron nail into the sole of her foot. Without having the wound\nexamined or even taking off her stocking she bade her daughter to oil\nthe nail thoroughly in the expectation that then nothing could happen to\nher. She died a few days later of tetanus[106] in consequence of\npostponed antisepsis.\nThe examples from this last group illustrate Frazer\u2019s distinction\nbetween _contagious_ magic and _imitative_ magic. What is considered as\neffective in these examples is no longer the similarity, but the\nassociation in space, the contiguity, or at least the imagined\ncontiguity, or the memory of its existence. But since similarity and\ncontiguity are the two essential principles of the processes of\nassociation of ideas, it must be concluded that the dominance of\nassociations of ideas really explains all the madness of the rules of\nmagic. We can see how true Tylor\u2019s quoted characteristic of magic:\n\u201cmistaking an ideal connection for a real one\u201d, proves to be. The same\nmay be said of Frazer\u2019s idea, who has expressed it in almost the same\nterms: \u201cmen mistook the order of their ideas for the order of nature,\nand hence imagined that the control which they have, or seem to have,\nover their thoughts, permitted them to have a corresponding control over\nthings\u201d[107].\nIt will at first seem strange that this illuminating explanation of\nmagic could have been rejected by some authors as unsatisfactory[108].\nBut on closer consideration we must sustain the objection that the\nassociation theory of magic merely explains the paths that magic\ntravels, and not its essential nature, that is, it does not explain the\nmisunderstanding which bids it put psychological laws in place of\nnatural ones. We are apparently in need here of a dynamic factor; but\nwhile the search for this leads the critics of Frazer\u2019s theory astray,\nit will be easy to give a satisfactory explanation of magic by carrying\nits association theory further and by entering more deeply into it.\nFirst let us examine the simpler and more important case of imitative\nmagic. According to Frazer this may be practised by itself, whereas\ncontagious magic as a rule presupposes the imitative[109]. The motives\nwhich impel one to exercise magic are easily recognized; they are the\nwishes of men. We need only assume that primitive man had great\nconfidence in the power of his wishes. At bottom everything which he\naccomplished by magic means must have been done solely because he wanted\nit. Thus in the beginning only his wish is accentuated.\nIn the case of the child which finds itself under analogous psychic\nconditions, without being as yet capable of motor activity, we have\nelsewhere advocated the assumption that it at first really satisfies\nits wishes by means of hallucinations, in that it creates the satisfying\nsituation through centrifugal excitements of its sensory organs[110].\nThe adult primitive man knows another way. A motor impulse, the will,\nclings to his wish and this will which later will change the face of the\nearth in the service of wish fulfilment is now used to represent the\ngratification so that one may experience it, as it were, through motor\nhallucination. Such a _representation_ of the gratified wish is\naltogether comparable to the _play_ of children, where it replaces the\npurely sensory technique of gratification. If play and imitative\nrepresentation suffice for the child and for primitive man, it must not\nbe taken as a sign of modesty, in our sense, or of resignation due to\nthe realization of their impotence, on the contrary; it is the very\nobvious result of the excessive valuation of their wish, of the will\nwhich depends upon the wish and of the paths the wish takes. In time the\npsychic accent is displaced from the motives of the magic act to its\nmeans, namely to the act itself. Perhaps it would be more correct to say\nthat primitive man does not become aware of the over-valuation of his\npsychic acts until it becomes evident to him through the means\nemployed. It would also seem as if it were the magic act itself which\ncompels the fulfilment of the wish by virtue of its similarity to the\nobject desired. At the stage of animistic thinking there is as yet no\nway of demonstrating objectively the true state of affairs, but this\nbecomes possible at later stages when, though such procedures are still\npractised, the psychic phenomenon of scepticism already manifests itself\nas a tendency to repression. At that stage men will acknowledge that the\nconjuration of spirits avails nothing unless accompanied by belief, and\nthat the magic effect of prayer fails if there is no piety behind\nit[111].\nThe possibility of a contagious magic which depends upon contiguous\nassociation will then show us that the psychic valuation of the wish and\nthe will has been extended to all psychic acts which the will can\ncommand. We may say that at present there is a general over-valuation of\nall psychic processes, that is to say there is an attitude towards the\nworld which according to our understanding of the relation of reality to\nthought must appear like an over-estimation of the latter. Objects as\nsuch are over-shadowed by the ideas representing them; what takes place\nin the latter must also happen to the former, and the relations which\nexist between ideas are also postulated as to things. As thought does\nnot recognize distances and easily brings together in one act of\nconsciousness things spatially and temporally far removed, the magic\nworld also puts itself above spatial distance by telepathy, and treats a\npast association as if it were a present one. In the animistic age the\nreflection of the inner world must obscure that other picture of the\nworld which we believe we recognize.\nLet us also point out that the two principles of association, similarity\nand contiguity, meet in the higher unity of contact. Association by\ncontiguity is contact in the direct sense, and association by similarity\nis contact in the transferred sense. Another identity in the psychic\nprocess which has not yet been grasped by us is probably concealed in\nthe use of the same word for both kinds of associations. It is the same\nrange of the concept of contact which we have found in the analysis of\ntaboo[112].\nIn summing up we may now say that the principle which controls magic,\nand the technique of the animistic method of thought, is \u2018Omnipotence of\nThought\u2019.\n3\nI have adopted the term \u2018Omnipotence of Thought\u2019 from a highly\nintelligent man, a former sufferer from compulsion neurosis, who, after\nbeing cured through psychoanalytic treatment, was able to demonstrate\nhis efficiency and good sense[113]. He had coined this phrase to\ndesignate all those peculiar and uncanny occurrences which seemed to\npursue him just as they pursue others afflicted with his malady. Thus if\nhe happened to think of a person, he was actually confronted with this\nperson as if he had conjured him up; if he inquired suddenly about the\nstate of health of an acquaintance whom he had long missed he was sure\nto hear that this acquaintance had just died, so that he could believe\nthat the deceased had drawn his attention to himself by telepathic\nmeans; if he uttered a half meant imprecation against a stranger, he\ncould expect to have him die soon thereafter and burden him with the\nresponsibility for his death. He was able to explain most of these cases\nin the course of the treatment, he could tell how the illusion had\noriginated, and what he himself had contributed towards furthering his\nsuperstitious expectations[114]. All compulsion neurotics are\nsuperstitious in this manner and often against their better judgment.\nThe existence of omnipotence of thought is most clearly seen in\ncompulsion neurosis, where the results of this primitive method of\nthought are most often found or met in consciousness. But we must guard\nagainst seeing in this a distinguishing characteristic of this neurosis,\nfor analytic investigation reveals the same mechanism in the other\nneuroses. In every one of the neuroses it is not the reality of the\nexperience but the reality of the thought which forms the basis for the\nsymptom formation. Neurotics live in a special world in which, as I have\nelsewhere expressed it, only the \u2018neurotic standard of currency\u2019 counts,\nthat is to say, only things intensively thought of or affectively\nconceived are effective with them, regardless of whether these things\nare in harmony with outer reality. The hysteric repeats in his attacks\nand fixates through his symptoms, occurrences which have taken place\nonly in his phantasy, though in the last analysis they go back to real\nevents or have been built up from them. The neurotic\u2019s guilty conscience\nis just as incomprehensible if traced to real misdeeds. A compulsion\nneurotic may be oppressed by a sense of guilt which is appropriate to a\nwholesale murderer, while at the same time he acts towards his fellow\nbeings in a most considerate and scrupulous manner, a behaviour which he\nevinced since his childhood. And yet his sense of guilt is justified; it\nis based upon intensive and frequent death wishes which unconsciously\nmanifest themselves towards his fellow beings. It is motivated from the\npoint of view of unconscious thoughts, but not of intentional acts. Thus\nthe omnipotence of thought, the over-estimation of psychic processes as\nopposed to reality, proves to be of unlimited effect in the neurotic\u2019s\naffective life and in all that emanates from it. But if we subject him\nto psychoanalytic treatment, which makes his unconscious thoughts\nconscious to him he refuses to believe that thoughts are free and is\nalways afraid to express evil wishes lest they be fulfilled in\nconsequence of his utterance. But through this attitude as well as\nthrough the superstition which plays an active part in his life he\nreveals to us how close he stands to the savage who believes he can\nchange the outer world by a mere thought of his.\nThe primary obsessive actions of these neurotics are really altogether\nof a magical nature. If not magic they are at least anti-magic and are\ndestined to ward off the expectation of evil with which the neurosis is\nwont to begin. Whenever I was able to pierce these secrets it turned out\nthat the content of this expectation of evil was death. According to\nSchopenhauer the problem of death stands at the beginning of every\nphilosophy; we have heard that the formation of the soul conception and\nof the belief in demons which characterize animism, are also traced back\nto the impression which death makes upon man. It is hard to decide\nwhether these first compulsive and protective actions follow the\nprinciple of similarity, or of contrast, for under the conditions of the\nneurosis they are usually distorted through displacement upon some\ntrifle, upon some action which in itself is quite insignificant[115].\nThe protective formul\u00e6 of the compulsion neurosis also have a\ncounterpart in the incantations of magic. But the evolution of\ncompulsive actions may be described by pointing out how these actions\nbegin as a spell against evil wishes which are very remote from anything\nsexual, only to end up as a substitute for forbidden sexual activity,\nwhich they imitate as faithfully as possible.\nIf we accept the evolution of man\u2019s conceptions of the universe\nmentioned above, according to which the _animistic_ phase is\n_succeeded_ by the _religious_, and this in turn by the _scientific_, we\nhave no difficulty in following the fortunes of the \u2018omnipotence of\nthought\u2019 through all these phases. In the animistic stage man ascribes\nomnipotence to himself; in the religious he has ceded it to the gods,\nbut without seriously giving it up, for he reserves to himself the right\nto control the gods by influencing them in some way or other in the\ninterest of his wishes. In the scientific attitude towards life there is\nno longer any room for man\u2019s omnipotence; he has acknowledged his\nsmallness and has submitted to death as to all other natural necessities\nin a spirit of resignation. Nevertheless, in our reliance upon the power\nof the human spirit which copes with the laws of reality, there still\nlives on a fragment of this primitive belief in the omnipotence of\nthought.\nIn retracing the development of libidinous impulses in the individual\nfrom its mature form back to its first beginnings in childhood, we at\nfirst found an important distinction which is stated in the _Three\nContributions to the Theory of Sex_[116]. The manifestations of sexual\nimpulses can be recognized from the beginning, but at first they are not\nyet directed to any outer object. Each individual component of the\nsexual impulse works for a gain in pleasure and finds its gratification\nin its own body. This stage is called _autoerotism_ and is distinguished\nfrom the stage of object selection.\nIn the course of further study it proved to be practical and really\nnecessary to insert a third stage between these two or, if one prefers,\nto divide the first stage of autoerotism into two. In this intermediary\nstage, the importance of which increases the more we investigate it, the\nsexual impulses which formerly were separate, have already formed into a\nunit and have also found an object; but this object is not external and\nforeign to the individual, but is his own ego, which is formed at this\nperiod. This new stage is called _narcism_, in view of the pathological\nfixation of this condition which may be observed later on. The\nindividual acts as if he were in love with himself; for the purposes of\nour analysis the ego impulses and the libidinous wishes cannot yet be\nseparated from each other.\nAlthough this narcistic stage, in which the hitherto dissociated sexual\nimpulses combine into a unity and take the ego as their object, cannot\nas yet be sharply differentiated, we can already surmise that the\nnarcistic organization is never altogether given up again. To a certain\nextent man remains narcistic, even after he had found outer subjects for\nhis libido, and the objects on which he bestows it represent, as it\nwere, emanations of the libido which remain with his ego and which can\nbe withdrawn into it. The state of being in love, so remarkable\npsychologically, and the normal prototype of the psychoses, corresponds\nto the highest stage of these emanations, in contrast to the state of\nself-love.\nThis high estimation of psychic acts found among primitives and\nneurotics, which we feel to be an overestimation, may now appropriately\nbe brought into relation to narcism, and interpreted as an essential\npart of it. We would say that among primitive people thinking is still\nhighly sexualized and that this accounts for the belief in the\nomnipotence of thought, the unshaken confidence in the capacity to\ndominate the world and the inaccessibility to the obvious facts which\ncould enlighten man as to his real place in the world. In the case of\nneurotics a considerable part of this primitive attitude had remained as\na constitutional factor, while on the other hand the sexual repression\noccurring in them has brought about a new sexualization of the processes\nof thought. In both cases, whether we deal with an original libidinous\ninvestment of thought or whether the same process has been accomplished\nregressively, the psychic results are the same, namely, intellectual\nnarcism and omnipotence of thought[117].\nIf we may take the now established omnipotence of thought among\nprimitive races as a proof of their narcism, we may venture to compare\nthe various evolutionary stages of man\u2019s conception of the universe with\nthe stages of the libidinous evolution of the individual. We find that\nthe animistic phase corresponds in time as well as in content with\nnarcism, the religious phase corresponds to that stage of object finding\nwhich is characterized by dependence on the parents, while the\nscientific stage has its full counterpart in the individual\u2019s stage of\nmaturity where, having renounced the pleasure principle and having\nadapted himself to reality, he seeks his object in the outer world[118].\nOnly in one field has the omnipotence of thought been retained in our\nown civilization, namely in art. In art alone it still happens that man,\nconsumed by his wishes, produces something similar to the gratification\nof these wishes, and this playing, thanks to artistic illusion, calls\nforth effects as if it were something real. We rightly speak of the\nmagic of art and compare the artist with a magician. But this comparison\nis perhaps more important than it claims to be. Art, which certainly did\nnot begin as art for art\u2019s sake, originally served tendencies which\nto-day have for the greater part ceased to exist. Among these we may\nsuspect various magic intentions[119].\n4\nAnimism, the first conception of the world which man succeeded in\nevolving, was therefore psychological. It did not yet require any\nscience to establish it, for science sets in only after we have realized\nthat we do not know the world and that we must therefore seek means of\ngetting to know it. But animism was natural and self-evident to\nprimitive man; he knew how the things of the world were constituted, and\nas man conceived himself to be. We are therefore prepared to find that\nprimitive man transferred the structural relations of his own psyche to\nthe outer world[120], and on the other hand we may make the attempt to\ntransfer back into the human soul what animism teaches about the nature\nof things.\nMagic, the technique of animism, clearly and unmistakably shows the\ntendency of forcing the laws of psychic life upon the reality of things,\nunder conditions where spirits did not yet have to play any r\u00f4le, and\ncould still be taken as objects of magic treatment. The assumptions of\nmagic are therefore of older origin than the spirit theory, which forms\nthe nucleus of animism. Our psychoanalytic view here coincides with a\ntheory of R. R. Marett, according to which animism is preceded by a\npre-animistic stage the nature of which is best indicated by the name\nAnimatism (the theory of general animation). We have practically no\nfurther knowledge of pre-animism, as no race has yet been found without\nconceptions of spirits[121].\nWhile magic still retains the full omnipotence of ideas, animism has\nceded part of this omnipotence to spirits and thus has started on the\nway to form a religion. Now what could have moved primitive man to this\nfirst act of renunciation? It could hardly have been an insight into the\nincorrectness of his assumptions, for he continued to retain the magic\ntechnique.\nAs pointed out elsewhere, spirits and demons were nothing but the\nprojection of primitive man\u2019s emotional impulses[122]; he personified\nthe things he endowed with effects, populated the world with them and\nthen rediscovered his inner psychic processes outside himself, quite\nlike the ingenious paranoiac Schreber, who found the fixations and\ndetachments of his libido reflected in the fates of the \u2018God-rays\u2019 which\nhe invented[123].\nAs on a former occasion[124], we want to avoid the problem as to the\norigin of the tendency to project psychic processes into the outer\nworld. It is fair to assume, however, that this tendency becomes\nstronger where the projection into the outer world offers psychic\nrelief. Such a state of affairs can with certainty be expected if the\nimpulses struggling for omnipotence have come into conflict with each\nother, for then they evidently cannot all become omnipotent. The morbid\nprocess in paranoia actually uses the mechanism of projection to solve\nsuch conflicts which arise in the psychic life. However, it so happens\nthat the model case of such a conflict between two parts of an\nantithesis is the ambivalent attitude which we have analysed in detail\nin the situation of the mourner at the death of one dear to him. Such a\ncase appeals to us especially fitted to motivate the creation of\nprojection formations. Here again we are in agreement with those authors\nwho declare that evil spirits were the first born among spirits, and\nfind the origin of soul conceptions in the impression which death makes\nupon the survivors. We differ from them only in not putting the\nintellectual problem which death imposes upon the living into the\nforeground, instead of which we transfer the force which stimulates\ninquiry to the conflict of feelings into which this situation plunges\nthe survivor.\nThe first theoretical accomplishment of man, the creation of spirits\nwould therefore spring from the same source as the first moral\nrestrictions to which he subjects himself, namely, the rules of taboo.\nBut the fact that they have the same source should not prejudice us in\nfavour of a simultaneous origin. If it really were the situation of the\nsurvivor confronted by the dead which first caused primitive man to\nreflect, so that he was compelled to surrender some of his omnipotence\nto spirits and to sacrifice a part of the free will of his actions,\nthese cultural creations would be a first recognition of the [Greek:\n\u1f01\u03bd\u1f01\u03b3\u03ba\u03b7 anagk\u00ea], which opposes man\u2019s narcism. Primitive man would bow to the\nsuperior power of death with the same gesture with which he seems to\ndeny it.\nIf we have the courage to follow our assumptions further, we may ask\nwhat essential part of our psychological structure is reflected and\nreviewed in the projection formation of souls and spirits. It is then\ndifficult to dispute that the primitive conception of the soul, though\nstill far removed from the later and wholly immaterial soul,\nnevertheless shares its nature and therefore looks upon a person or a\nthing as a duality, over the two elements of which the known properties\nand changes of the whole are distributed. This origin duality, we have\nborrowed the term from Herbert Spencer[125], is already identical with\nthe dualism which manifests itself in our customary separation of spirit\nfrom body, and whose indestructible linguistic manifestations we\nrecognize, for instance, in the description of a person who faints or\nraves as one who is \u2018beside himself.\u2019[126]\nThe thing which we, just like primitive man, project in outer reality,\ncan hardly be anything else than the recognition of a state in which a\ngiven thing is present to the senses and to consciousness, next to which\nanother state exists in which the thing is _latent_, but can reappear,\nthat is to say, the co-existence of perception and memory, or, to\ngeneralize it, the existence of unconscious psychic processes next to\nconscious ones[127]. It might be said that in the last analysis the\n\u2018spirit\u2019 of a person or thing is the faculty of remembering and\nrepresenting the object, after he or it was withdrawn from conscious\nperception.\nOf course we must not expect from either the primitive or the current\nconception of the \u2018soul\u2019 that its line of demarcation from other parts\nshould be as marked as that which contemporary science draws between\nconscious and unconscious psychic activity. The animistic soul, on the\ncontrary, unites determinants from both sides. Its flightiness and\nmobility, its faculty of leaving the body, of permanently or temporarily\ntaking possession of another body, all these are characteristics which\nremind us unmistakably of the nature of consciousness. But the way in\nwhich it keeps itself concealed behind the personal appearance reminds\nus of the unconscious; to-day we no longer ascribe its unchangeableness\nand indestructibility to conscious but to unconscious processes and look\nupon these as the real bearers of psychic activity.\nWe said before that animism is a system of thought, the first complete\ntheory of the world; we now want to draw certain inferences through\npsychoanalytic interpretation of such a system. Our everyday experience\nis capable of constantly showing us the main characteristics of the\n\u2018system\u2019. We dream during the night and have learnt to interpret the\ndream in the daytime. The dream can, without being untrue to its nature,\nappear confused and incoherent; but on the other hand it can also\nimitate the order of impressions of an experience, infer one occurrence\nfrom another, and refer one part of its contents to another. The dream\nsucceeds more or less in this, but hardly ever succeeds so completely\nthat an absurdity or a gap in the structure does not appear somewhere.\nIf we subject the dream to interpretation we find that this unstable and\nirregular order of its components is quite unimportant for our\nunderstanding of it. The essential part of the dream are the dream\nthoughts, which have, to be sure, a significant, coherent, order. But\ntheir order is quite different from that which we remember from the\nmanifest content of the dream. The coherence of the dream thoughts has\nbeen abolished and may either remain altogether lost or can be replaced\nby the new coherence of the dream content. Besides the condensation of\nthe dream elements there is almost regularly a re-grouping of the same\nwhich is more or less independent of the former order. We say in\nconclusion, that what the dream-work has made out of the material of the\ndream thoughts has been subjected to a new influence, the so-called\nsecondary elaboration, the object of which evidently is to do away with\nthe incoherence and incomprehensibility caused by the dream-work, in\nfavour of a new \u2018meaning\u2019. This new meaning which has been brought about\nby the secondary elaboration is no longer the meaning of the dream\nthoughts.\nThe secondary elaboration of the product of the dream-work is an\nexcellent example of the nature and the pretensions of a system. An\nintellectual function in us demands the unification, coherence and\ncomprehensibility of everything perceived and thought of, and does not\nhesitate to construct a false connexion if, as a result of special\ncircumstances, it cannot grasp the right one. We know such system\nformation not only from the dream, but also from phobias, from\ncompulsive thinking and from the types of delusions. The system\nformation is most ingenious in delusional states (paranoia) and\ndominates the clinical picture, but it also must not be overlooked in\nother forms of neuropsychoses. In every case we can show that a\nre-arrangement of the psychic material takes place, which may often be\nquite violent, provided it seems comprehensible from the point of view\nof the system. The best indication that a system has been formed then\nlies in the fact that each result of it can be shown to have at least\ntwo motivations one of which springs from the assumptions of the system\nand is therefore eventually delusional,--and a hidden one which,\nhowever, we must recognize as the real and effective motivation.\nAn example from a neurosis may serve as illustration. In the chapter on\ntaboo I mentioned a patient whose compulsive prohibitions correspond\nvery neatly to the taboo of the Maori.[128] The neurosis of this woman\nwas directed against her husband and culminated in the defence against\nthe unconscious wish for his death. But her manifest systematic phobia\nconcerned the mention of death in general, in which her husband was\naltogether eliminated and never became the object of conscious\nsolicitude. One day she heard her husband give an order to have his dull\nrazors taken to a certain shop to have them sharpened. Impelled by a\npeculiar unrest she went to the shop herself, and on her return from\nthis reconnoitre she asked her husband to lay the razors aside for good\nbecause she had discovered that there was a warehouse of coffins and\nfuneral accessories next to the shop he mentioned. She claimed that he\nhad intentionally brought the razors into permanent relation with the\nidea of death. This was then the systematic motivation of the\nprohibition, but we may be sure that the patient would have brought home\nthe prohibition relating to the razors even if she had not discovered\nthis warehouse in the neighbourhood. For it would have been sufficient\nif on her way to the shop she had met a hearse, a person in mourning, or\nsomebody carrying a wreath. The net of determinants was spread out far\nenough to catch the prey in any case, it was simply a question whether\nshe should pull it in or not. It could be established with certainty\nthat she did not mobilize the determinants of the prohibition in other\ncircumstances. She would then have said it had been one of her \u2018better\ndays\u2019. The real reason for the prohibition of the razor was, of course,\nas we can easily guess, her resistance against a pleasurably\naccentuated idea that her husband might cut his throat with the\nsharpened razors.\nIn much the same way a motor inhibition, an abasia or an agoraphobia,\nbecomes perfected and detailed if the symptom once succeeds in\nrepresenting an unconscious wish and of imposing a defence against it.\nAll the patient\u2019s remaining unconscious phantasies and effective\nreminiscences strive for symptomatic expression through this outlet,\nwhen once it has been opened, and range themselves appropriately in the\nnew order within the sphere of the disturbance of gait. It would\ntherefore be a futile and really foolish way to begin to try to\nunderstand the symptomatic structure, and the details of, let us say, an\nagoraphobia, in terms of its basic assumptions. For the whole logic and\nstrictness of connexion is only apparent. Sharper observation can\nreveal, as in the formation of the fa\u00e7ade in the dream, the greatest\ninconsistency and arbitrariness in the symptom formation. The details of\nsuch a systematic phobia take their real motivation from concealed\ndeterminants which must have nothing to do with the inhibition in gait;\nit is for this reason that the form of such a phobia varies so and is so\ncontradictory in different people.\nIf we now attempt to retrace the system of animism with which we are\nconcerned, we may conclude from our insight into other psychological\nsystems that \u2018superstition\u2019 need not be the only and actual motivation\nof such a single rule or custom even among primitive races, and that we\nare not relieved of the obligation of seeking for concealed motives.\nUnder the dominance of an animistic system it is absolutely essential\nthat each rule and activity should receive a systematic motivation which\nwe to-day call \u2018superstitious\u2019. But \u2018superstition\u2019, like \u2018anxiety\u2019,\n\u2018dreams\u2019, and \u2018demons\u2019, is one of the preliminaries of psychology which\nhave been dissipated by psychoanalytic investigation. If we get behind\nthese structures, which like a screen conceal understanding, we realize\nthat the psychic life and the cultural level of savages have hitherto\nbeen inadequately appreciated.\nIf we regard the repression of impulses as a measure of the level of\nculture attained, we must admit that under the animistic system too,\nprogress and evolution have taken place, which unjustly have been\nunder-estimated on account of their superstitious motivation. If we hear\nthat the warriors of a savage tribe impose the greatest chastity and\ncleanliness upon themselves as soon as they go upon the war-path[129],\nthe obvious explanation is that they dispose of their refuse in order\nthat the enemy may not come into possession of this part of their person\nin order to harm them by magical means, and we may surmise analogous\nsuperstitious motivations for their abstinence. Nevertheless the fact\nremains that the impulse is renounced and we probably understand the\ncase better if we assume that the savage warrior imposes such\nrestrictions upon himself in compensation, because he is on the point of\nallowing himself the full satisfaction of cruel and hostile impulses\notherwise forbidden. The same holds good for the numerous cases of\nsexual restriction while he is preoccupied with difficult or responsible\ntasks[130]. Even if the basis of these prohibitions can be referred to\nsome association with magic, the fundamental conception of gaining\ngreater strength by foregoing gratification of desires nevertheless\nremains unmistakable, and besides the magic rationalization of the\nprohibition, one must not neglect its hygienic root. When the men of a\nsavage tribe go away to hunt, fish, make war, or collect valuable\nplants, the women at home are in the meantime subjected to numerous\noppressive restrictions which, according to the savages themselves,\nexert a sympathetic effect upon the success of the far away expedition.\nBut it does not require much acumen to guess that this element acting\nat a distance is nothing but a thought of home, the longing of the\nabsent, and that these disguises conceal the sound psychological insight\nthat the men will do their best only if they are fully assured of the\nwhereabouts of their guarded women. On other occasions the thought is\ndirectly expressed without magic motivation that the conjugal infidelity\nof the wife thwarts the absent husband\u2019s efforts.\nThe countless taboo rules to which the women of savages are subject\nduring their menstrual periods are motivated by the superstitious dread\nof blood which in all probability actually determines it. But it would\nbe wrong to overlook the possibility that this blood dread also serves\n\u00e6sthetic and hygienic purposes which in every case have to be covered by\nmagic motivations.\nWe are probably not mistaken in assuming that such attempted\nexplanations expose us to the reproach of attributing a most improbable\ndelicacy of psychic activities to contemporary savages.\nBut I think that we may easily make the same mistake with the psychology\nof these races who have remained at the animistic stage that we made\nwith the psychic life of the child, which we adults understood no better\nand whose richness and fineness of feeling we have therefore so greatly\nundervalued.\nI want to consider another group of hitherto unexplained taboo rules\nbecause they admit of an explanation with which the psychoanalyst is\nfamiliar. Under certain conditions it is forbidden to many savage races\nto keep in the house sharp weapons and instruments for cutting[131].\nFrazer sites a German superstition that a knife must not be left lying\nwith the edge pointing upward because God and the angels might injure\nthemselves with it. May we not recognize in this taboo a premonition of\ncertain \u2018symptomatic actions\u2019[132] for which the sharp weapon might be\nused by unconscious evil impulses?\nCHAPTER IV\nTHE INFANTILE RECURRENCE OF TOTEMISM\nThe reader need not fear that psychoanalysis, which first revealed the\nregular over-determination of psychic acts and formations, will be\ntempted to derive anything so complicated as religion from a single\nsource. If it necessarily seeks, as in duty bound, to gain recognition\nfor one of the sources of this institution, it by no means claims\nexclusiveness for this source or even first rank among the concurring\nfactors. Only a synthesis from various fields of research can decide\nwhat relative importance in the genesis of religion is to be assigned to\nthe mechanism which we are to discuss; but such a task exceeds the means\nas well as the intentions of the psychoanalyst.\n1\nThe first chapter of this book made us acquainted with the conception of\ntotemism. We heard that totemism is a system which takes the place of\nreligion among certain primitive races in Australia, America, and\nAfrica, and furnishes the basis of social organization. We know that in\n1869 the Scotchman MacLennan attracted general interest to the phenomena\nof totemism, which until then had been considered merely as curiosities,\nby his conjecture that a large number of customs and usages in various\nold as well as modern societies were to be taken as remnants of a\ntotemic epoch. Science has since then fully recognized this significance\nof totemism. I quote a passage from the _Elements of the Psychology of\nRaces_ by W. Wundt (1912), as the latest utterance on this\nquestion[133]: \u2018Taking all this together it becomes highly probable that\na totemic culture was at one time the preliminary stage of every later\nevolution as well as a transition stage between the state of primitive\nman and the age of gods and heroes.\u2019\nIt is necessary for the purposes of this chapter to go more deeply into\nthe nature of totemism. For reasons that will be evident later I here\ngive preference to an outline by S. Reinach, who in the year 1900\nsketched the following _Code du Tot\u00e9misme_ in twelve articles, like a\ncatechism of the totemic religion[134]:\n1. Certain animals must not be killed or eaten, but men bring up\nindividual animals of these species and take care of them.\n2. An animal that dies accidentally is mourned and buried with the same\nhonours as a member of the tribe.\n3. The prohibition as to eating sometimes refers only to a certain part\nof the animal.\n4. If pressure of necessity compels the killing of an animal usually\nspared, it is done with excuses to the animal and the attempt is made to\nmitigate the violation of the taboo, namely the killing, through various\ntricks and evasions.\n5. If the animal is sacrificed by ritual, it is solemnly mourned.\n6. At specified solemn occasions, like religious ceremonies, the skins\nof certain animals are donned. Where totemism still exists, these are\ntotem animals.\n7. Tribes and individuals assume the names of totem animals.\n8. Many tribes use pictures of animals as coats of arms and decorate\ntheir weapons with them; the men paint animal pictures on their bodies\nor have them tattooed.\n9. If the totem is one of the feared and dangerous animals it is assumed\nthat the animal will spare the members of the tribe named after it.\n10. The totem animal protects and warns the members of the tribe.\n11. The totem animal foretells the future to those faithful to it and\nserves as their leader.\n12. The members of a totem tribe often believe that they are connected\nwith the totem animal by the bond of common origin.\nThe value of this catechism of the totem religion can be more\nappreciated if one bears in mind that Reinach has here also incorporated\nall the signs and clews which lead to the conclusion that the totemic\nsystem had once existed. The peculiar attitude of this author to the\nproblem is shown by the fact that to some extent he neglects the\nessential traits of totemism, and we shall see that of the two main\ntenets of the totemistic catechism he has forced one into the background\nand completely lost sight of the other.\nIn order to get a more correct picture of the characteristics of\ntotemism we turn to an author who has devoted four volumes to the theme,\ncombining the most complete collection of the observations in question\nwith the most thorough discussion of the problems they raise. We shall\nremain indebted to J. G. Frazer, the author of _Totemism and\nExogamy_[135], for the pleasure and information he affords, even though\npsychoanalytic investigation may lead us to results which differ widely\nfrom his[136].\n\u201cA totem,\u201d wrote Frazer in his first essay[137], \u201cis a class of material\nobjects which a savage regards with superstitious respect, believing\nthat there exists between him and every member of the class an intimate\nand altogether special relation. The connexion between a person and his\ntotem is mutually beneficent; the totem protects the man and the man\nshows his respect for the totem in various ways, by not killing it if it\nbe an animal, and not cutting or gathering it if it be a plant. As\ndistinguished from a fetich, a totem is never an isolated individual but\nalways a class of objects, generally a species of animals or of plants,\nmore rarely a class of inanimate natural objects, very rarely a class of\nartificial objects.\u201d\nAt least three kinds of totem can be distinguished:\n1. The tribal totem which a whole tribe shares and which is hereditary\nfrom generation to generation,\n2. The sex totem which belongs to all the masculine or feminine members\nof a tribe to the exclusion of the opposite sex, and\n3. The individual totem which belongs to the individual and does not\ndescend to his successors.\nThe last two kinds of totem are comparatively of little importance\ncompared to the tribal totem. Unless we are mistaken they are recent\nformations and of little importance as far as the nature of the taboo is\nconcerned.\nThe tribal totem (clan totem) is the object of veneration of a group of\nmen and women who take their name from the totem and consider themselves\nconsanguineous offspring of a common ancestor, and who are firmly\nassociated with each other through common obligations towards each other\nas well as by the belief in their totem.\nTotemism is a religious as well as a social system. On its religious\nside it consists of the relations of mutual respect and consideration\nbetween a person and his totem, and on its social side it is composed of\nobligations of the members of the clan towards each other and towards\nother tribes. In the later history of totemism these two sides show a\ntendency to part company; the social system often survives the religious\nand conversely remnants of totemism remain in the religion of countries\nin which the social system based upon totemism had disappeared. In the\npresent state of our ignorance about the origin of totemism we cannot\nsay with certainty how these two sides were originally combined. But\nthere is on the whole a strong probability that in the beginning the two\nsides of totemism were indistinguishable from each other. In other\nwords, the further we go back the clearer it becomes that a member of a\ntribe looks upon himself as being of the same genus as his totem and\nmakes no distinction between his attitude towards the totem and his\nattitude towards his tribal companions.\nIn the special description of totemism as a religious system, Frazer\nlays stress on the fact that the members of a tribe assume the name of\ntheir totem and also as a _rule believe that they are descended from\nit._ It is due to this belief that they do not hunt the totem animal or\nkill or eat it, and that they deny themselves every other use of the\ntotem if it is not an animal. The prohibitions against killing or eating\nthe totem are not the only taboos affecting it; sometimes it is also\nforbidden to touch it and even to look at it; in a number of cases the\ntotem must not be called by its right name. Violation of the taboo\nprohibitions which protect the totem is punished automatically by\nserious disease or death[138].\nSpecimens of the totem animals are sometimes raised by the clan and\ntaken care of in captivity[139]. A totem animal found dead is mourned\nand buried like a member of the clan. If a totem animal had to be killed\nit was done with a prescribed ritual of excuses and ceremonies of\nexpiation.\nThe tribe expected protection and forbearance from its totem. If it was\na dangerous animal (a beast of prey or a poisonous snake), it was\nassumed that it would not harm, and where this assumption did not come\ntrue the person attacked was expelled from the tribe. Frazer thinks that\noaths were originally ordeals, many tests as to descent and genuineness\nbeing in this way left to the decision of the totem. The totem helps in\ncase of illness and gives the tribe premonitions and warnings. The\nappearance of the totem animal near a house was often looked upon as an\nannouncement of death. The totem had come to get its relative[140].\nA member of a clan seeks to emphasize his relationship to the totem in\nvarious significant ways; he imitates an exterior similarity by dressing\nhimself in the skin of the totem animal, by having the picture of it\ntattooed upon himself, and in other ways. On the solemn occasions of\nbirth, initiation into manhood or funeral obsequies this identification\nwith the totem is carried out in deeds and words. Dances in which all\nthe members of the tribe disguise themselves as their totem and act like\nit, serve various magic and religious purposes. Finally there are the\nceremonies at which the totem animal is killed in a solemn manner[141].\nThe social side of totemism is primarily expressed in a sternly\nobserved commandment and in a tremendous restriction. The members of a\ntotem clan are brothers and sisters, pledged to help and protect each\nother; if a member of the clan is slain by a stranger the whole tribe of\nthe slayer must answer for the murder and the clan of the slain man\nshows its solidarity in the demand for expiation for the blood that has\nbeen shed. The ties of the totem are stronger than our ideas of family\nties, with which they do not altogether coincide, since the transfer of\nthe totem takes place as a rule through maternal inheritance, paternal\ninheritance possibly not counting at all in the beginning.\nBut the corresponding taboo restriction consists in the prohibition\nagainst members of the same clan marrying each other or having any kind\nof sexual intercourse whatsoever with each other. This is the famous and\nenigmatic _exogamy_ connexion with totemism. We have devoted the whole\nfirst chapter of this book to it, and therefore need only mention here\nthat this exogamy springs from the intensified incest dread of primitive\nraces, that it becomes entirely comprehensible as a security against\nincest in group marriages, and that at first it accomplishes the\navoidance of incest for the younger generation and only in the course\nof further development becomes a hindrance to the older generation as\nwell[142].\nTo this presentation of totemism by Frazer, one of the earliest in the\nliterature on the subject, I will now add a few excerpts from one of the\nlatest summaries. In the _Elements of the Psychology of Races_, which\nappeared in 1912, W. Wundt says[143]: \u201cThe totem animal is considered\nthe ancestral animal. \u2018Totem\u2019 is therefore both a group name and a birth\nname and in the latter aspect this name has at the same time a\nmythological meaning. But all these uses of the conception play into\neach other and the particular meanings may recede so that in some cases\nthe totems have become almost a mere nomenclature of the tribal\ndivisions, while in others the idea of the descent or else the cultic\nmeaning of the totem remains in the foreground.... The conception of the\ntotem determines the _tribal_ arrangement and the _tribal organization_.\nThese norms and their establishment in the belief and feelings of the\nmembers of the tribe account for the fact that originally the totem\nanimal was certainly not considered merely a name for a group division\nbut that it usually was considered the progenitor of the corresponding\ndivision.... This accounted for the fact that these animal ancestors\nenjoyed a cult.... This animal cult expresses itself primarily in the\nattitude towards the totem animal, quite aside from special ceremonies\nand ceremonial festivities: not only each individual animal but every\nrepresentative of the same species was to a certain degree a sanctified\nanimal; the member of the totem was forbidden to eat the flesh of the\ntotem animal or he was allowed to eat it only under special\ncircumstances. This is in accord with the significant contradictory\nphenomenon found in this connexion, namely, that under certain\nconditions there was a kind of ceremonial consumption of the totem\nflesh....\u201d\n\u201c ...But the most important social side of this totemic tribal\narrangement consists in the fact that it was connected with certain\nrules of conduct for the relations of the groups with each other. The\nmost important of these were the rules of conjugal relations. This\ntribal division is thus connected with an important phenomenon which\nfirst made its appearance in the totemic age, namely with exogamy.\u201d\nIf we wish to arrive at the characteristics of the original totemism by\nsifting through everything that may correspond to later development or\ndecline, we find the following essential facts: _The totems were\noriginally only animals and were considered the ancestors of single\ntribes. The totem was hereditary only through the female line; it was\nforbidden to kill the totem_ (or to eat it, which under primitive\nconditions amounts to the same thing); _members of a totem were\nforbidden to have sexual intercourse with each other_[144].\nIt may now seem strange to us that in the _Code du tot\u00e9misme_ which\nReinach has drawn up the one principal taboo, namely exogamy, does not\nappear at all while the assumption of the second taboo, namely the\ndescent from the totem animal, is only casually mentioned. Yet Reinach\nis an author to whose work in this field we owe much and I have chosen\nhis presentation in order to prepare us for the differences of opinion\namong the authors, which will now occupy our attention.\n2\nThe more convinced we became that totemism had regularly formed a phase\nof every culture, the more urgent became the necessity of arriving at an\nunderstanding of it and of casting light upon the riddle of its nature.\nTo be sure, everything about totemism is in the nature of a riddle; the\ndecisive questions are the origin of the totem, the motivation of\nexogamy (or rather of the incest taboo which it represents) and the\nrelation between the two, the totem organization and the incest\nprohibition. The understanding should be at once historical and\npsychological; it should inform us under what conditions this peculiar\ninstitution developed and to what psychic needs of man it has given\nexpression.\nThe reader will certainly be astonished to hear from how many different\npoints of view the answer to these questions has been attempted and how\nfar the opinions of expert investigators vary. Almost everything that\nmight be asserted in general about totemism is doubtful; even the above\nstatement of it, taken from an article by Frazer in 1887, cannot escape\nthe criticism that it expresses an arbitrary preference of the author\nand would be challenged to-day by Frazer himself, who has repeatedly\nchanged his view on the subject[145].\nIt is quite obvious that the nature of totemism and exogamy could be\nmost readily grasped if we could get into closer touch with the origin\nof both institutions. But in judging the state of affairs we must not\nforget the remark of Andrew Lang, that even primitive races have not\npreserved these original forms and the conditions of their origin, so\nthat we are altogether dependent upon hypotheses to take the place of\nthe observation we lack[146]. Among the attempted explanations some seem\ninadequate from the very beginning in the judgment of the psychologist.\nThey are altogether too rational and do not take into consideration the\neffective character of what they are to explain. Others rest on\nassumptions which observation fails to verify; while still others appeal\nto facts which could better be subjected to another interpretation. The\nrefutation of these various opinions as a rule hardly presents any\ndifficulties; the authors are, as usual, stronger in the criticism which\nthey practice on each other than in their own work. The final result as\nregards most of the points treated is a _non liquet_. It is therefore\nnot surprising that most of the new literature on the subject, which we\nhave largely omitted here, shows the unmistakable effort to reject a\ngeneral solution of totemic problems as unfeasible. (See, for instance,\nB. Goldenweiser in the _Journal of American Folklore_ <small>XXIII</small>, 1910.\nReviewed in the _Brittanica Year Book_, 1913.) I have taken the liberty\nof disregarding the chronological order in stating these contradictory\nhypotheses.\n(_a_) THE ORIGIN OF TOTEMISM\nThe question of the origin of totemism can also be formulated as\nfollows: How did primitive people come to select the names of animals,\nplants and inanimate objects for themselves and their tribes?[147]\nThe Scotchman, MacLennan, who discovered totemism and exogamy for\nscience[148], refrained from publishing his views of the origin of\ntotemism. According to a communication of Andrew Lang[149] he was for a\ntime inclined to trace totemism back to the custom of tattooing. I shall\ndivide the accepted theories of the derivation of totemism into three\ngroups, ([Greek: \u03b1 a]) nominalistic, ([Greek: \u03b2 b]) sociological, ([Greek:\n\u03b3 g]) psychological.\n([Greek: \u03b1 a]) _The Nominalistic Theories_\nThe information about these theories will justify their summation under\nthe headings I have used.\nGarcilaso de La Vega, a descendant of the Peruvian Inkas, who wrote the\nhistory of his race in the seventeenth century, is already said to have\ntraced back what was known to him about totemic phenomena to the need of\nthe tribes to differentiate themselves from each other by means of\nnames[150]. The same idea appears centuries later in the _Ethnology_ of\nA. K. Keane where totems are said to be derived from heraldic badges\nthrough which individuals, families and tribes wanted to differentiate\nthemselves[151].\nMax M\u00fcller expresses the same opinion about the meaning of the totem in\nhis _Contributions to the Science of Mythology_[152]. A totem is said to\nbe, 1. a mark of the clan, 2. a clan name, 3. the name of the ancestor\nof the clan, 4. the name of the object which the clan reveres. J. Pikler\nwrote later, in 1899, that men needed a permanent name for communities\nand individuals that could be preserved in writing.... Thus totemism\narises, not from a religious, but from a prosaic everyday need of\nmankind. The giving of names, which is the essence of totemism, is a\nresult of the technique of primitive writing. The totem is of the nature\nof an easily represented writing symbol. But if savages first bore the\nname of an animal they deduced the idea of relationship from this\nanimal[153].\nHerbert Spencer[154], also, thought that the origin of totemism was to\nbe found in the giving of names. The attributes of certain individuals,\nhe showed, had brought about their being named after animals so that\nthey had come to have names of honour or nicknames which continued in\ntheir descendants. As a result of the indefiniteness and\nincomprehensibility of primitive languages, these names are said to have\nbeen taken by later generations as proof of their descent from the\nanimals themselves. Totemism would thus be the result of a mistaken\nreverence for ancestors.\nLord Avebury (better known under his former name, Sir John Lubbock) has\nexpressed himself quite similarly about the origin of totemism, though\nwithout emphasizing the misunderstanding. If we want to explain the\nveneration of animals we must not forget how often human names are\nborrowed from animals. The children and followers of a man who was\ncalled bear or lion naturally made this their ancestral name. In this\nway it came about that the animal itself came to be respected and\nfinally venerated.\nFison has advanced what seems an irrefutable objection to such a\nderivation of the totem name from the names of individuals[155]. He\nshows from conditions in Australia that the totem is always the mark of\na group of people and never of an individual. But if it were otherwise,\nif the totem was originally the name of a single individual, it could\nnever, with the system of maternal inheritance, descend to his children.\nThe theories thus far stated are evidently inadequate. They may explain\nhow animal names came to be applied to primitive tribes but they can\nnever explain the importance attached to the giving of names which\nconstitutes the totemic system. The most noteworthy theory of this\ngroup has been developed by Andrew Lang in his books, _Social Origins_,\n1903, and _The Secret of the Totem_, 1905. This theory still makes\nnaming the centre of the problem, but it uses two interesting\npsychological factors and thus may claim to have contributed to the\nfinal solution of the riddle of totemism.\nAndrew Lang holds that it does not make any difference how clans\nacquired their animal names. It might be assumed that one day they awoke\nto the consciousness that they had them without being able to account\nfrom where they came. _The origin of these names had been forgotten._ In\nthat case they would seek to acquire more information by pondering over\ntheir names, and with their conviction of the importance of names they\nnecessarily came to all the ideas that are contained in the totemic\nsystem. For primitive men, as for savages of to-day and even for our\nchildren[156], a name is not indifferent and conventional as it seems to\nus, but is something important and essential. A man\u2019s name is one of the\nmain constituents of his person and perhaps a part of his psyche. The\nfact that they had the same names as animals must have led primitive men\nto assume a secret and important bond between their persons and the\nparticular animal species. What other bond than consanguinity could it\nbe? But if the similarity of names once led to this assumption it could\nalso account directly for all the totemic prohibitions of the blood\ntaboo, including exogamy.\n\u201cNo more than these three things--a group animal name of unknown origin;\nbelief in a transcendental connexion between all bearers, human and\nbestial, of the same name; and belief in the blood superstitions--were\nneeded to give rise to all the totemic creeds and practices, including\nexogamy\u201d (_Secret of the Totem_, p. 126).\nLang\u2019s explanation extends over two periods. It derives the totemic\nsystem of psychological necessity from the totem names, on the\nassumption that the origin of the naming has been forgotten. The other\npart of the theory now seeks to clear up the origin of these names. We\nshall see that it bears an entirely different stamp.\nThis other part of the Lang theory is not markedly different from those\nwhich I have called \u2018nominalistic\u2019. The practical need of\ndifferentiation compelled the individual tribes to assume names and\ntherefore they tolerated the names which every tribe ascribed to the\nother. This \u2018naming from without\u2019 is the peculiarity of Lang\u2019s\nconstruction. The fact that the names which thus originated were\nborrowed from animals is not further remarkable and need not have been\nfelt by primitive men as abuse or derision. Besides, Lang has cited\nnumerous cases from later epochs of history in which names given from\nwithout that were first meant to be derisive were accepted by those\nnicknamed and voluntarily borne (The Guises, Whigs and Tories). The\nassumption that the origin of these names was forgotten in the course of\ntime connects this second part of the Lang theory with the first one\njust mentioned.\n([Greek: \u03b2 b]) _The Sociological Theories_\nS. Reinach, who successfully traced the relics of the totemic system in\nthe cult and customs of later periods, though attaching from the very\nbeginning only slight value to the factor of descent from the totem\nanimal, once made the casual remark that totemism seemed to him to be\nnothing but \u201c_une hypertrophie de l\u2019instinct social_.\u201d[157]\nThe same interpretation seems to permeate the new work of E. Durkheim,\n_Les Formes \u00c9l\u00e9mentaires de la Vie Religieuse; Le Syst\u00eame Tot\u00e9mique en\nAustralie_, 1912. The totem is the visible representative of the social\nreligion of these races. It embodies the community, which is the real\nobject of veneration.\nOther authors have sought a more intimate reason for the share which\nsocial impulses have played in the formation of totemic institutions.\nThus A. C. Haddon has assumed that every primitive tribe originally\nlived on a particular plant or animal species and perhaps also traded\nwith this food and exchanged it with other tribes. It then was\ninevitable that a tribe should become known to other tribes by the name\nof the animal which played such weighty r\u00f4le with it. At the same time\nthis tribe would develop a special familiarity with this animal, and a\nkind of interest for it which, however, was based upon the psychic\nmotive of man\u2019s most elementary and pressing need, namely, hunger[158].\nThe objections against this most rational of all the totem theories are\nthat such a state of the food supply is never found among primitive men\nand probably never existed. Savages are the more omnivorous the lower\nthey stand in the social scale. Besides, it is incomprehensible how such\nan exclusive diet could have developed an almost religious relation to\nthe totem, culminating in an absolute abstention from the referred food.\nThe first of the three theories about the origin of totemism which\nFrazer stated was a psychological one. We shall report it elsewhere.\nFrazer\u2019s second theory, which we will discuss here, originated under the\ninfluence of an important publication by two investigators of the\ninhabitants of Central Australia[159].\nSpencer and Gillen describe a series of peculiar institutions, customs,\nand opinions of a group of tribes, the so-called Arunta nation, and\nFrazer subscribes to their opinion that these peculiarities are to be\nlooked upon as characteristics of a primary state and that they can\nexplain the first and real meaning of totemism.\nIn the Arunta tribe itself (a part of the Arunta nation) these\npeculiarities are as follows:\n1. They have the division into totem clans but the totem is not\nhereditary but is individually determined (as will be shown later).\n2. The totem clans are not exogamous, and the marriage restrictions are\nbrought about by a highly developed division into marriage classes which\nhave nothing to do with the totems.\n3. The function of the totem clan consists of carrying out a ceremony\nwhich in a subtle magic manner brings about an increase of the edible\ntotem. (This ceremony is called _Intichiuma_.)\n4. The Aruntas have a peculiar theory about conception and re-birth.\nThey assume that the spirits of the dead who belonged to their totem\nwait for their re-birth in definite localities and penetrate into the\nbodies of the women who pass such a spot. When a child is born the\nmother states at which spirit abode she thinks she conceived her child.\nThis determines the totem of the child. It is further assumed that the\nspirits (of the dead as well as of the re-born) are bound to peculiar\nstone amulets, called _Churinga_, which are found in these places.\nTwo factors seem to have induced Frazer to believe that the oldest form\nof totemism had been found in the institution of the Aruntas. In the\nfirst place the existence of certain myths which assert that the\nancestors of the Aruntas always lived on their totem animal, and that\nthey married no other women except those of their own totem. Secondly,\nthe apparent disregard of the sexual act in their theory of conception.\nPeople who have not yet realized that conception was the result of the\nsexual act might well be considered the most backward and primitive\npeople living to-day.\nFrazer, in having recourse to the _Intichiuma_ ceremony to explain\ntotemism, suddenly saw the totemic system in a totally different light\nas a thoroughly practical organization for accomplishing the most\nnatural needs of man. (Compare Haddon above[160].) The system was simply\nan extraordinary piece of \u2018co-operative magic\u2019. Primitive men formed\nwhat might be called a magic production and consumption club. Each totem\nclan undertook to see to the cleanliness of a certain article of food.\nIf it were a question of inedible totems like harmful animals, rain,\nwind, or similar objects, it was the duty of the totem clan to dominate\nthis part of nature and to ward off its injuriousness. The efforts of\neach clan were for the good of all the others. As the clan could not eat\nits totem or could eat only a very little of it, it furnished this\nvaluable product for the rest and was in turn furnished with what these\nhad to take care of as their social totem duty. In the light of this\ninterpretation furnished by the _Intichiuma_ ceremony, it appeared to\nFrazer as if the prohibition against eating the totem had misled\nobservers to neglect the more important side of the relation, namely the\ncommandment to supply as much as possible of the edible totem for the\nneeds of others.\nFrazer accepted the tradition of the Aruntas that each totem clan had\noriginally lived on its totem without any restriction. It then became\ndifficult to understand the evolution that followed through which\nsavages were satisfied to ensure the totem for others while they\nthemselves abstained from eating it. He then assumed that this\nrestriction was by no means the result of a kind of religious respect,\nbut came about through the observation that no animal devoured its own\nkind, so that this break in the identification with the totem was\ninjurious to the power which savages sought to acquire over the totem.\nOr else it resulted from the endeavour to make the being favourably\ndisposed by sparing it. Frazer did not conceal the difficulties of this\nexplanation from himself[161], nor did he dare to indicate in what way\nthe habit of marrying within the totem, which the myths of the Aruntas\nproclaimed, was converted into exogamy.\nFrazer\u2019s theory based on the _Intichiuma_, stands or falls with the\nrecognition of the primitive nature of the Arunta institutions. But it\nseems impossible to hold to this in the fact of the objections advanced\nby Durkheim[162] and Lang[163]. The Aruntas seem on the contrary to be\nthe most developed of the Australian tribes and to represent rather a\ndissolution stage of totemism than its beginning. The myths that made\nsuch an impression on Frazer because they emphasize, in contrast to\nprevailing institutions of to-day, that the Aruntas are free to eat the\ntotem and to marry within it, easily explain themselves to us as wish\nphantasies, which are projected into the past, like the myths of the\nGolden Age.\n([Greek: \u03b3 g]) _The Psychological Theories_\nFrazer\u2019s first psychological theories, formed before his acquaintance\nwith the observations of Spencer and Gillen, were based upon the belief\nin an \u2018outward soul\u2019[164]. The totem was meant to represent a safe place\nof refuge where the soul is deposited in order to avoid the dangers\nwhich threaten it. After primitive man had housed his soul in his totem\nhe himself became invulnerable and he naturally took care himself not to\nharm the bearer of his soul. But as he did not know which individual of\nthe species in question was the bearer of his soul he was concerned in\nsparing the whole species. Frazer himself later gave up this derivation\nof totemism from the belief in souls.\nWhen he became acquainted with the observations of Spencer and Gillen\nhe set up the other social theory which has just been stated, but he\nhimself then saw that the motive from which he had derived totemism was\naltogether too \u2018rational\u2019 and that he had assumed a social organization\nfor it which was altogether too complicated to be called primitive[165].\nThe magic co-operative companies now appeared to him rather as the fruit\nthan as the germ of totemism. He sought a simpler factor for the\nderivation of totemism in the shape of a primitive superstition behind\nthese forms. He then found this original factor in the remarkable\nconception theory of the Aruntas.\nAs already stated, the Aruntas establish no connexion between conception\nand the sexual act. If a woman feels herself to be a mother it means\nthat at that moment one of the spirits from the nearest spirit abode who\nhas been watching for a re-birth, has penetrated into her body and is\nborn as her child. This child has the same totem as all the spirits that\nlurk in that particular locality. But if we are willing to go back a\nstep further and assume that the woman originally believed that the\nanimal, plant, stone, or other object which occupied her fancy at the\nmoment when she first felt herself pregnant had really penetrated into\nher and was being born through her in human form, then the identity of a\nhuman being with his totem would really be founded on the belief of the\nmother, and all the other totem commandments (with the exception of\nexogamy) could easily be derived from this belief. Men would refuse to\neat the particular animal or plant because it would be just like eating\nthemselves. But occasionally they would be impelled to eat some of their\ntotem in a ceremonial manner because they could thus strengthen their\nidentification with the totem, which is the essential part of totemism.\nW. H. R. Rivers\u2019 observations among the inhabitants of the Bank Islands\nseemed to prove men\u2019s direct identification with their totems on the\nbasis of such a conception theory[166].\nThe ultimate sources of totemism would then be the ignorance of savages\nas to the process of procreation among human beings and animals;\nespecially their ignorance as to the r\u00f4le which the male plays in\nfertilization. This ignorance must be facilitated by the long interval\nwhich is interposed between the fertilizing act and the birth of the\nchild or the sensation of the child\u2019s first movements. Totemism is\ntherefore a creation of the feminine mind and not of the masculine. The\nsick fancies of the pregnant woman are the roots of it. Anything indeed\nthat struck a woman at that mysterious moment of her life when she first\nknows herself to be a mother might easily be identified by her with the\nchild in her womb. Such maternal fancies, so natural and seemingly so\nuniversal, appear to be the root of totemism[167].\nThe main objection to this third theory of Frazer\u2019s is the same which\nhas already been advanced against his second, sociological theory. The\nAruntas seem to be far removed from the beginnings of totemism. Their\ndenial of fatherhood does not apparently rest upon primitive ignorance;\nin many cases they even have paternal inheritance. They seem to have\nsacrificed fatherhood to a kind of a speculation which strives to honour\nthe ancestral spirits[168]. Though they raise the myth of immaculate\nconception through a spirit to a general theory of conception, we cannot\nfor that reason credit them with ignorance as to the conditions of\nprocreation any more than we could the old races who lived during the\nrise of the Christian myths.\nAnother psychological theory of the origin of totemism has been\nformulated by the Dutch writer, G. A. Wilcken. It establishes a\nconnexion between totemism and the migration of souls. \u201cThe animal into\nwhich, according to general belief, the souls of the dead passed, became\na blood relative, an ancestor, and was revered as such.\u201d But the belief\nin the soul\u2019s migration to animals is more readily derived from totemism\nthan inversely[169].\nStill another theory of totemism is advanced by the excellent American\nethnologists, Franz Boas, Hill-Tout, and others. It is based on\nobservations of totemic Indian tribes and asserts that the totem is\noriginally the guardian spirit of an ancestor who has acquired it\nthrough a dream and handed it on to his descendants. We have already\nheard the difficulties which the derivation of totemism through\ninheritance from a single individual offers; besides, the Australian\nobservations seem by no means to support the tracing back of the totem\nto the guardian spirit[170].\nTwo facts have become decisive for the last of the psychological\ntheories as stated by Wundt; in the first place, that the original and\nmost widely known totem object was an animal, and secondly, that the\nearliest totem animals corresponded to animals which had a soul[171].\nSuch animals as birds, snakes, lizards, mice are fitted by their extreme\nmobility, their flight through the air, and by other characteristics\nwhich arouse surprise and fear, to become the bearers of souls which\nleave their bodies. The totem animal is a descendant of the animal\ntransformations of the spirit-soul. Thus with Wundt totemism is directly\nconnected with the belief in souls or with animism.\n(b) and (c) THE ORIGIN OF EXOGAMY AND ITS RELATION TO TOTEMISM\nI have put forth the theories of totemism with considerable detail and\nyet I am afraid that I have not made them clear enough on account of the\ncondensation that was constantly necessary. In the interest of the\nreader I am taking the liberty of further condensing the other questions\nthat arise. The discussions about the exogamy of totem races become\nespecially complicated and untractable, one might even say confused, on\naccount of the nature of the material used. Fortunately the object of\nthis treatise permits me to limit myself to pointing out several\nguide-posts and referring to the frequently quoted writings of experts\nin the field for a more thorough pursuit of the subject.\nThe attitude of an author to the problems of exogamy is of course not\nindependent of the stand he has taken toward one or the other of the\ntotem theories. Some of these explanations of totemism lack all\nconnexion with exogamy so that the two institutions are entirely\nseparated. Thus we find here two opposing views, one of which clings to\nthe original likelihood that exogamy is an essential part of the totemic\nsystem while the other disputes such a connection and believes in an\naccidental combination of these two traits of the most ancient cultures.\nIn his later works Frazer has emphatically stood for this latter point\nof view.\n\u201cI must request the reader to bear constantly in mind that the two\ninstitutions of totemism and exogamy are fundamentally distinct in\norigin and nature though they have accidentally crossed and blended in\nmany tribes.\u201d (_Totemism and Exogamy_ I, Preface XII.)\nHe warns directly against the opposite view as being a source of endless\ndifficulties and misunderstandings. In contrast to this, many authors\nhave found a way of conceiving exogamy as a necessary consequence of the\nbasic views on totemism. Durkheim[172] has shown in his writings how\nthe taboo, which is attached to the totem, must have entailed the\nprohibition against putting a woman of the same totem to sexual uses.\nThe totem is of the same blood as the human being and for this reason\nthe blood bann (in reference to defloration and menstruation) forbids\nsexual intercourse with a woman of the same totem[173]. Andrew Lang, who\nhere agrees with Durkheim, goes so far as to believe that the blood\ntaboo was not necessary to bring about the prohibition in regard to the\nwomen of the same tribe[174]. The general totem taboo which, for\ninstance, forbids any one to sit in the shadow of the totem tree, would\nhave sufficed. Andrew Lang also contends for another derivation of\nexogamy (see below) and leaves it in doubt how these two explanations\nare related to each other.\nAs regards the temporal relations, the majority of authors subscribe to\nthe opinion that totemism is the older institution and that exogamy came\nlater[175].\nAmong the theories which seek to explain exogamy independently of\ntotemism only a few need be mentioned in so far as they illustrate\ndifferent attitudes of the authors towards the problem of incest.\nMacLennan[176] had ingeniously guessed that exogamy resulted from the\nremnants of customs pointing to earlier forms of female rape. He assumed\nthat it was the general custom in ancient times to procure women from\nstrange tribes so that marriage with a woman from the same tribe\ngradually became \u201cimproper because it was unusual\u201d. He sought the motive\nfor the exogamous habit in the scarcity of women among these tribes,\nwhich had resulted from the custom of killing most female children at\nbirth. We are not concerned here with investigation whether actual\nconditions corroborate MacLennan\u2019s assumptions. We are more interested\nin the argument that these premises still leave it unexplained why the\nmale members of the tribe should have made these few women of their\nblood inaccessible to themselves, as well as in the manner in which the\nincest problem is here entirely neglected[177].\nOther writers have on the contrary assumed, and evidently with more\nright, that exogamy is to be interpreted as an institution for the\nprevention of incest[178].\nIf we survey the gradually increasing complication of Australian\nmarriage restrictions we can hardly help agreeing with the opinion of\nMorgan Frazer, Hewitt and Baldwin Spencer[179], that these institutions\nbear the stamp of \u2018deliberate design\u2019, as Frazer puts it, and that they\nwere meant to do what they have actually accomplished. \u201cIn no other way\ndoes it seem possible to explain in all its details a system at once so\ncomplex and so regular\u201d[180].\nIt is of interest to point out that the first restrictions which the\nintroduction of marriage classes brought about affected the sexual\nfreedom of the younger generation, in other words, incest between\nbrothers and sisters and between sons and mothers, while incest between\nfather and daughter was only abrogated by more sweeping measures.\nHowever, to trace back exogamous sexual restrictions to legal intentions\ndoes not add anything to the understanding of the motive which created\nthese institutions. From what source, in the final analysis, springs the\ndread of incest which must be recognized as the root of exogamy? It\nevidently does not suffice to appeal to an instinctive aversion against\nsexual intercourse with blood relatives, that is to say, to the fact of\nincest dread, in order to explain the dread of incest, if social\nexperience shows that, in spite of this instinct, incest is not a rare\noccurrence even in our society, and if the experience of history can\nacquaint us with cases in which incestuous marriage of privileged\npersons was made the rule.\nWestermarck[181] advanced the following to explain the dread of incest:\n\u201cthat an innate aversion against sexual intercourse exists between\npersons who live together from childhood and that this feeling, since\nsuch persons are as a rule consanguineous, finds a natural expression in\ncustom and law through the abhorrence of sexual intercourse between\nthose closely related.\u201d Though Havelock Ellis disputed the instinctive\ncharacter of this aversion in the _Studies in the Psychology of Sex_, he\notherwise supported the same explanation in its essentials by declaring:\n\u201cThe normal absence of the manifestation of the pairing instinct where\nbrothers and sisters or boys and girls living together from childhood\nare concerned, is a purely negative phenomenon due to the fact that\nunder these circumstances the antecedent conditions for arousing the\nmating instinct must be entirely lacking.... For persons who have grown\nup together from childhood habit has dulled the sensual attraction of\nseeing, hearing and touching and has led it into a channel of quiet\nattachment, robbing it of its power to call forth the necessary\nerethistic excitement required to produce sexual tumescence.\u201d\nIt seems to me very remarkable that Westermarck looks upon this innate\naversion to sexual intercourse with persons with whom we have shared\nchildhood as being at the same time a psychic representative of the\nbiological fact that inbreeding means injury to the species. Such a\nbiological instinct would hardly go so far astray in its psychological\nmanifestation as to affect the companions of home and hearth which in\nthis respect are quite harmless, instead of the blood relatives which\nalone are injurious to procreation. And I cannot resist citing the\nexcellent criticism which Frazer opposes to Westermarck\u2019s assertion.\nFrazer finds it incomprehensible that sexual sensibility to-day is not\nat all opposed to sexual intercourse with companions of the hearth and\nhome while the dread of incest, which is said to be nothing but an\noffshoot of this reluctance, has nowadays grown to be so overpowering.\nBut other remarks of Frazer\u2019s go deeper and I set them down here in\nunabbreviated form because they are in essential agreement with the\narguments developed in my chapter on taboo.\n\u201cIt is not easy to see why any deep human instinct should need\nreinforcement through law. There is no law commanding men to eat and\ndrink, or forbidding them to put their hands in the fire. Men eat and\ndrink and keep their hands out of the fire instinctively, for fear of\nnatural, not legal penalties, which would be entailed by violence done\nto these instincts. The law only forbids men to do what their instincts\nincline them to do; what nature itself prohibits and punishes it would\nbe superfluous for the law to prohibit and punish. Accordingly we may\nalways safely assume that crimes forbidden by law are crimes which many\nmen have a natural propensity to commit. If there were no such\npropensity there would be no such crimes, and if no such crimes were\ncommitted, what need to forbid them? Instead of assuming therefore, from\nthe legal prohibition of incest, that there is a natural aversion to\nincest we ought rather to assume that there is a natural instinct in\nfavour of it, and that if the law represses it, it does so because\ncivilized men have come to the conclusion that the satisfaction of these\nnatural instincts is detrimental to the general interests of\nsociety\u201d[182].\nTo this valuable argument of Frazer\u2019s I can add that the experiences of\npsychoanalysis make the assumption of such an innate aversion to\nincestuous relations altogether impossible. They have taught, on the\ncontrary, that the first sexual impulses of the young are regularly of\nan incestuous nature and that such repressed impulses play a r\u00f4le which\ncan hardly be overestimated as the motive power of later neuroses.\nThe interpretation of incest dread as an innate instinct must therefore\nbe abandoned. The same holds true of another derivation of the incest\nprohibition which counts many supporters, namely the assumption that\nprimitive races very soon observed the dangers with which inbreeding\nthreatened their race and that they therefore had decreed the incest\nprohibition with a conscious purpose. The objections to this attempted\nexplanation crowd upon each other[183]. Not only must the prohibition of\nincest be older than all breeding of domestic animals from which men\ncould derive experience of the effect of inbreeding upon the\ncharacteristics of the breed, but the harmful consequences of inbreeding\nare not established beyond all doubt even to-day and in man they can be\nshown only with difficulty. Besides, everything that we know about\ncontemporaneous savages makes it very improbable that the thoughts of\ntheir far-removed ancestors should already have been occupied with\npreventing injury to their later descendants. It sounds almost\nridiculous to attribute hygienic and eugenic motives such as have hardly\nyet found consideration in our culture, to these children of the race\nwho lived without thought of the morrow[184].\nAnd finally it must be pointed out that a prohibition against inbreeding\nas an element weakening to the race, which is imposed from practical\nhygienic motives, seems quite inadequate to explain the deep abhorrence\nwhich our society feels against incest. This dread of incest, as I have\nshown elsewhere[185], seems to be even more active and stronger among\nprimitive races living to-day than among the civilized.\nIn inquiring into the origin of incest dread it could be expected that\nhere also there is the choice between possible explanations of a\nsociological, biological, and psychological nature in which the\npsychological motives might have to be considered as representative of\nbiological forces. Still, in the end, one is compelled to subscribe to\nFrazer\u2019s resigned statement, namely, that we do not know the origin of\nincest dread and do not even know how to guess at it. None of the\nsolutions of the riddle thus far advanced seems satisfactory to us[186].\nI must mention another attempt to explain the origin of incest dread\nwhich is of an entirely different nature from those considered up to\nnow. It might be called an historic explanation.\nThis attempt is associated with a hypothesis of Charles Darwin about the\nprimal social state of man. From the habits of the higher apes Darwin\nconcluded that man, too, lived originally in small hordes in which the\njealousy of the oldest and strongest male prevented sexual promiscuity.\n\u201cWe may indeed conclude from what we know of the jealousy of all male\nquadrupeds, armed, as many of them are, with special weapons for\nbattling with their rivals, that promiscuous intercourse in a state of\nnature is extremely improbable.... If we therefore look back far enough\ninto the stream of time and judging from the social habits of man as he\nnow exists, the most probable view is that he originally lived in small\ncommunities, each with a single wife, or if powerful with several, whom\nhe jealously defended against all other men. Or he may not have been a\nsocial animal and yet have lived with several wives, like the gorilla;\nfor all the natives agree that only the adult male is seen in a band;\nwhen the young male grows up a contest takes place for mastery, and the\nstrongest, by killing and driving out the others, establishes himself as\nthe head of the community (Dr Savage in the Boston _Journal of Natural\nHistory_, Vol. V, 1845-7). The younger males being thus driven out and\nwandering about would also, when at last successful in finding a\npartner, prevent too close breeding within the limits of the same\nfamily\u201d[187].\nAtkinson[188] seems to have been the first to recognize that these\nconditions of the Darwinian primal horde would in practice bring about\nthe exogamy of the young men. Each one of those driven away could found\na similar horde in which, thanks to jealousy of the chief, the same\nprohibition as to sexual intercourse obtained, and in the course of time\nthese conditions would have brought about the rule which is now known as\nlaw: no sexual intercourse with the members of the horde. After the\nadvent of totemism the rule would have changed into a different form: no\nsexual intercourse within the totem.\nAndrew Lang[189] declared himself in agreement with this explanation of\nexogamy. But in the same book he advocates the other theory of Durkheim\nwhich explains exogamy as a consequence of the totem laws. It is not\naltogether easy to combine the two interpretations; in the first case\nexogamy would have existed before totemism; in the second case it would\nbe a consequence of it[190].\n3\nInto this darkness psychoanalytic experience throws one single ray of\nlight.\nThe relation of the child to animals has much in common with that of\nprimitive man. The child does not yet show any trace of the pride which\nafterwards moves the adult civilized man to set a sharp dividing line\nbetween his own nature and that of all other animals. The child\nunhesitatingly attributes full equality to animals; he probably feels\nhimself more closely related to the animal than to the undoubtedly\nmysterious adult, in the freedom with which he acknowledges his needs.\nNot infrequently a curious disturbance manifests itself in this\nexcellent understanding between child and animal. The child suddenly\nbegins to fear a certain animal species and to protect himself against\nseeing or touching any individual of this species. There results the\nclinical picture of _animal phobia_, which is one of the most frequent\namong the psychoneurotic diseases of this age and perhaps the earliest\nform of such an ailment. The phobia is as a rule in regard to animals\nfor which the child has until then shown the liveliest interest and has\nnothing to do with the individual animal. In cities the choice of\nanimals which can become the object of phobia is not great. They are\nhorses, dogs, cats, more seldom birds, and strikingly often very small\nanimals like bugs and butterflies. Sometimes animals which are known to\nthe child only from picture books and fairy stories become objects of\nthe senseless and inordinate anxiety which is manifested with these\nphobias; it is seldom possible to learn the manner in which such an\nunusual choice of anxiety has been brought about. I am indebted to Dr\nKarl Abraham for the report of a case in which the child itself\nexplained its fear of wasps by saying that the colour and the stripes of\nthe body of the wasp had made it think of the tiger of which, from all\nthat it had heard, it might well be afraid.\nThe animal phobias have not yet been made the object of careful\nanalytical investigation, although they very much merit it. The\ndifficulties of analysing children of so tender an age have probably\nbeen the motive of such neglect. It cannot therefore be asserted that\nthe general meaning of these illnesses is known, and I myself do not\nthink that it would turn out to be the same in all cases. But a number\nof such phobias directed against larger animals have proved accessible\nto analysis and have thus betrayed their secret to the investigator. In\nevery case it was the same: the fear at bottom was of the father, if the\nchildren examined were boys, and was merely displaced upon the animal.\nEvery one of any experience in psychoanalysis has undoubtedly seen such\ncases and has received the same impression from them. But I can refer to\nonly a few detailed reports on the subject. This is an accident of the\nliterature of such cases, from which the conclusion should not be drawn\nthat our general assertion is based on merely scattered observation. For\ninstance I mention an author, M. Wulff of Odessa, who has very\nintelligently occupied himself with the neuroses of childhood. He tells,\nin relating the history of an illness, that a nine year old boy suffered\nfrom a dog phobia at the age of four. \u201cWhen he saw a dog running by on\nthe street he wept and cried: \u2018Dear dog, don\u2019t touch me, I will be\ngood.\u2019\u201d By \u201cbeing good\u201d he meant \u201cnot to play violin any more\u201d (to\npractise onanism)[A].\nThe same author later sums up as follows: \u201cHis dog phobia is really his\nfear of the father displaced upon the dog, for his peculiar expression:\n\u2018Dog, I will be good\u2019--that is to say, I will not masturbate--really\nrefers to the father who has forbidden masturbation.\u201d He then adds\nsomething in a note which fully agrees with my experience and at the\nsame time bears witness to the abundance of such experiences: \u201csuch\nphobias (of horses, dogs, cats, chickens and other domestic animals)\nare, I think, at least as prevalent as _pavor nocturnus_ in childhood,\nand usually reveal themselves in the analysis as a displacement of fear\nfrom one of the parents to animals. I am not prepared to assert that the\nwide-spread mouse and rat phobia has the same mechanism.\u201d\nI reported the \u201cAnalysis of the Phobia of a five-year-old Boy\u201d[191]\nwhich the father of the little patient had put at my disposal. It was a\nfear of horses as a result of which the boy refused to go on the street.\nHe expressed his apprehension that the horse would come into the room\nand bite him. It proves that this was meant to be the punishment for his\nwish that the horse should fall over (die). After assurances had\nrelieved the boy of his fear of his father, it proved that he was\nfighting against wishes whose content was the absence (departure or\ndeath) of the father. He indicated only too plainly that he felt the\nfather to be his rival for the favour of the mother, upon whom his\nbudding sexual wishes were by dark premonitions directed. He therefore\nhad the typical attitude of the male child to its parents which we call\nthe \u2018Oedipus complex\u2019 in which we recognize the central complex of the\nneuroses in general. Through the analysis, of \u2018little John\u2019 we have\nlearnt a fact which is very valuable in relation to totemism, namely,\nthat under such conditions the child displaces a part of its feelings\nfrom the father upon some animal.\nAnalysis showed the paths of association, both significant and\naccidental in content, along which such a displacement took place. It\nalso allowed one to guess the motives for the displacement. The hate\nwhich resulted from the rivalry for the mother could not permeate the\nboy\u2019s psychic life without being inhibited; he had to contend with the\ntenderness and admiration which he had felt for his father from the\nbeginning, so that the child assumed a double or ambivalent emotional\nattitude towards the father and relieved himself of this ambivalent\nconflict by displacing his hostile and anxious feelings upon a\nsubstitute for the father. The displacement could not, however, relieve\nthe conflict by bringing about a smooth division between the tender and\nthe hostile feelings. On the contrary, the conflict was continued in\nreference to the object to which displacement has been made and to which\nalso the ambivalence spreads. There was no doubt that little John had\nnot only fear, but respect and interest for horses. As soon as his fear\nwas moderated he identified himself with the feared animal; he jumped\naround like a horse, and now it was he who bit the father[192]. In\nanother stage of solution of the phobia he did not scruple to identify\nhis parents with other large animals[193].\nWe may venture the impression that certain traits of totemism return as\na negative expression in these animal phobias of children. But we are\nindebted to S. Ferenczi for a beautiful individual observation of what\nmust be called a case of positive totemism in the child[194]. It is true\nthat with the little Arp\u00e1d, whom Ferenczi reports, the totemic interests\ndo not awaken in direct connexion with the Oedipus complex, but on the\nbasis of a narcistic premise, namely, the fear of castration. But\nwhoever looks attentively through the history of little John will also\nfind there abundant proof that the father was admired as the possessor\nof large genitals and was feared as threatening the child\u2019s own\ngenitals. In the Oedipus as well as in the castration complex the father\nplays the same r\u00f4le of feared opponent to the infantile sexual\ninterests. Castration and its substitute through blinding is the\npunishment he threatens[195].\nWhen little Arp\u00e1d was two and a half years old he once tried, while at a\nsummer resort, to urinate into the chicken coop, and on this occasion a\nchicken bit his penis or snapped at it. When he returned to the same\nplace a year later he became a chicken himself, was interested only in\nthe chicken coop and in everything that occurred there, and gave up\nhuman speech for cackling and crowing. During the period of\nobservation, at the age of five, he spoke again, but his speech was\nexclusively about chickens and other fowl. He played with no other toy\nand sang only songs in which there was something about poultry. His\nbehaviour towards his totem animal was subtly ambivalent, expressing\nitself in immoderate hating and loving. He loved best to play killing\nchickens. \u201cThe slaughtering of poultry was quite a festival for him. He\ncould dance around the animals\u2019 bodies for hours at a time in a state of\nintense excitement[196].\u201d But then he kissed and stroked the slaughtered\nanimal, and cleaned and caressed the chicken effigies which he himself\nhad ill-used.\nArp\u00e1d himself saw to it that the meaning of his curious activity could\nnot remain hidden. At times he translated his wishes from the totemic\nmethod, of expression back into that of everyday life. \u201cNow I am small,\nnow I am a chicken. When I get bigger I shall be a fowl. When I am\nbigger still, I shall be a cock.\u201d On another occasion he suddenly\nexpressed the wish to eat a \u201cpotted mother\u201d (by analogy, potted fowl).\nHe was very free with open threats of castration against others, just as\nhe himself had received them on account of onanistic preoccupation with\nhis penis.\nAccording to Ferenczi there was no doubt as to the source of his\ninterest in the activities of the chicken yard: \u201cThe continual sexual\nactivity between cock and hen, the laying of eggs and the creeping out\nof the young brood\u201d[197] satisfied his sexual curiosity which really was\ndirected towards human family life. His object wishes have been formed\non the model of chicken life when we find him saying to a woman\nneighbour: \u201cI am going to marry you and your sister and my three cousins\nand the cook; no, instead of the cook I\u2019ll marry my mother.\u201d\nWe shall be able to complete our consideration of these observations\nlater; at present we will only point out two traits that show a valuable\ncorrespondence with totemism: the complete identification with the totem\nanimal[198], and the ambivalent affective attitude towards it. In view\nof these observations we consider ourselves justified in substituting\nthe father for the totem animal in the male\u2019s formula of totemism. We\nthen notice that in doing so we have taken no new or especially daring\nstep. For primitive men say it themselves and, as far as the totemic\nsystem is still in effect to-day, the totem is called ancestor and\nprimal father. We have only taken literally an expression of these races\nwhich ethnologists did not know what to do with and were therefore\ninclined to put it into the background. Psychoanalysis warns us, on the\ncontrary, to emphasize this very point and to connect it with the\nattempt to explain totemism[199].\nThe first result of our substitution is very remarkable. If the totem\nanimal is the father, then the two main commandments of totemism, the\ntwo taboo rules which constitute its nucleus,--not to kill the totem\nanimal and not to use a woman belonging to the same totem for sexual\npurposes,--agree in content with the two crimes of Oedipus, who slew his\nfather and took his mother to wife, and also with the child\u2019s two primal\nwishes whose insufficient repression or whose re-awakening forms the\nnucleus of perhaps all neuroses. If this similarity is more than a\ndeceptive play of accident it would perforce make it possible for us to\nshed light upon the origin of totemism in prehistoric times. In other\nwords, we should succeed in making it probable that the totemic system\nresulted from the conditions underlying the Oedipus complex, just as the\nanimal phobia of \u2018little John\u2019 and the poultry perversion of \u2018little\nArp\u00e1d\u2019 resulted from it. In order to trace this possibility we shall in\nwhat follows study a peculiarity of the totemic system or, as we may\nsay, of the totemic religion, which until now could hardly be brought\ninto the discussion.\n4\nW. Robertson Smith, who died in 1894, was a physicist, philologist,\nBible critic, and arch\u00e6ologist, a many-sided as well as keen and\nfree-thinking man, expressed the assumption in his work, _The Religion\nof the Semites_[200], published in 1889, that a peculiar ceremony, the\nso-called _totem feast_, had, from the very beginning, formed an\nintegral part of the totemic system. For the support of this supposition\nhe had at his disposal at that time only a single description of such an\nact from the year 500 <small>A.D.</small>; he knew, however, how to give a high degree\nof probability to his assumption through his analysis of the nature of\nsacrifice among the old Semites. As sacrifice assumes a godlike person\nwe are dealing here with an inference from a higher phase of religious\nrite to its lowest phase in totemism.\nI shall now cite from Robertson Smith\u2019s excellent book[201] those\nstatements about the origin and meaning of the sacrificial right which\nare of great interest to us; I shall omit the only too numerous tempting\ndetails as well as the parts dealing with all later developments. In\nsuch an excerpt it is quite impossible to give the reader any sense of\nthe lucidity or of the argumentative force of the original.\nRobertson Smith shows that sacrifice at the altar was the essential part\nof the rite of old religions. It plays the same r\u00f4le in all religions,\nso that its origin must be traced back to very general causes whose\neffects were everywhere the same.\nBut the sacrifice--the holy action [Greek: \u03ba\u03b1\u03c4\u03b5\u03be\u03bf\u03b3\u03b7 katezog\u00ea] (sacrificium\n[Greek: \u1f31\u03b5\u03c1\u03bf\u03c5\u03c1\u03b3\u1f31\u03b1 ieronrgia])--originally meant something different from what\nlater times understood by it: the offering to the deity in order to\nreconcile him or to incline him to be favourable. The profane use of the\nword was afterwards derived from the secondary sense of self-denial. As\nis demonstrated the first sacrifice was nothing else than \u201can act of\nsocial fellowship between the deity and his worshipper\u201d.\nThings to eat and drink were brought as sacrifice; man offered to his\ngod the same things as those on which he himself lived, flesh, cereals,\nfruits, wine and oil. Only in regard to sacrificial flesh did there\nexist restrictions and exceptions. The god partakes of the animal\nsacrifices with his worshippers while the vegetable sacrifices are left\nto him alone. There is no doubt that animal sacrifices are older and at\none time were the only forms of sacrifice. The vegetable sacrifices\nresulted from the offering of the first-fruits and correspond to a\ntribute to the lord of the soil and the land. But animal sacrifice is\nolder than agriculture.\nLinguistic survivals make it certain that the part of the sacrifice\ndestined for the god was looked upon as his real food. This conception\nbecame offensive with the progressive dematerialization of the deity,\nand was avoided by offering the deity only the liquid part of the meal.\nLater the use of fire, which made the sacrificial flesh ascend in smoke\nfrom the altar, made it possible to prepare human food in such a way\nthat it was more suitable for the deity. The drink sacrifice was\noriginally the blood of the sacrificed animals; wine was used later as a\nsubstitute for the blood. Primitive man looked upon wine as the \u201cblood\nof the grape\u201d, as our poets still call it.\nThe oldest form of sacrifice, older than the use of fire and the\nknowledge of agriculture, was therefore the sacrifice of animals, whose\nflesh and blood the god and his worshippers ate together. It was\nessential that both participants should receive their shares of the\nmeal.\nSuch a sacrifice was a public ceremony, the celebration of a whole clan.\nAs a matter of fact all religion was a public affair; religious duty was\na part of the social obligation. Sacrifice and festival go together\namong all races; each sacrifice entails a holiday and no holiday can be\ncelebrated without a sacrifice. The sacrificial festival was an occasion\nfor joyously transcending one\u2019s own interests and emphasizing social\ncommunity and community with god.\nThe ethical power of the public sacrificial feast was based upon primal\nconceptions of the meaning of eating and drinking in common. To eat and\ndrink with some one was at the same time a symbol and a confirmation of\nsocial community and of the assumption of mutual obligations; the\nsacrificial eating gave direct expression to the fact that the god and\nhis worshippers are communicants, thus confirming all their other\nrelations. Customs that to-day still are in force among the Arabs of the\ndesert prove that the binding force resulting from the common meal is\nnot a religious factor but that the subsequent mutual obligations are\ndue to the act of eating itself. Whoever has shared the smallest bite\nwith such a Bedouin, or has taken a swallow of his milk, need not fear\nhim any longer as an enemy, but may be sure of his protection and help.\nNot indeed, forever, strictly speaking this lasts only while it may be\nassumed that the food partaken remains in the body. So realistically is\nthe bond of union conceived; it requires repetition to strengthen it and\nmake it endure.\nBut why is this binding power ascribed to eating and drinking in common?\nIn the most primitive societies there is only one unconditional and\nnever failing bond, that of kinship. The members of a community stand by\neach other jointly and severally, a kin is a group of persons whose life\nis so bound into a physical unity that they can be considered as parts\nof a common life. In case of the murder of one of this kin they\ntherefore do not say: the blood of so and so has been spilt, but our\nblood has been spilt. The Hebraic phrase by which the tribal relation is\nacknowledged is: \u201cThou art my bone and my flesh\u201d. Kinship therefore\nsignifies having part in a general substance. It is natural then that it\nis based not only upon the fact that we are a part of the substance of\nour mother who has borne us, and whose milk nourished us, but also that\nthe food eaten later through which the body is renewed, can acquire and\nstrengthen kinship. If one shared a meal with one\u2019s god the conviction\nwas thus expressed that one was of the same substance as he; no meal was\ntherefore partaken with any one recognized as a stranger.\nThe sacrificial repast was therefore originally a feast of the kin,\nfollowing the rule that only those of kin could eat together. In our\nsociety the meal unites the members of the family; but the sacrificial\nrepast has nothing to do with the family. Kinship is older than family\nlife; the oldest families known to us regularly comprised persons who\nbelonged to various bonds of kinship. The men married women of strange\nclans and the children inherited the clan of the mother; there was no\nkinship between the man and the rest of the members of the family. In\nsuch a family there was no common meal. Even to-day savages eat apart\nand alone, and the religious prohibitions of totemism as to eating often\nmake it impossible for them to eat with their wives and children.\nLet us now turn to the sacrificial animal. There was, as we have heard,\nno meeting of the kin without animal sacrifice, but, and this is\nsignificant, no animal was slaughtered except for such a solemn\noccasion. Without any hesitation the people ate fruits, game and the\nmilk of domestic animals, but religious scruples made it impossible for\nthe individual to kill a domestic animal for his own use. There is not\nthe least doubt, says Robertson Smith, that every sacrifice was\noriginally a clan sacrifice, and that the _killing of a sacrificial\nanimal_ originally belonged to those acts which were _forbidden to the\nindividual and were only justified if the whole kin assumed the\nresponsibility_. Primitive men had only one class of actions, which were\nthus characterized, namely, actions which touched the holiness of the\nkin\u2019s common blood. A life which no individual might take and which\ncould be sacrificed only through the consent and participation of all\nthe members of the clan was on the same plane as the life of a member of\nthe kin. The rule that every guest of the sacrificial repast must\npartake of the flesh of the sacrificial animal, had the same meaning as\nthe rule that the execution of a guilty member of the kin must be\nperformed by the whole kin. In other words: the sacrificial animal was\ntreated like one of kin; _the sacrificing community, its god, and the\nsacrificial animal were of the same blood_, and the members of a clan.\nOn the basis of much evidence Robertson Smith identifies the sacrificial\nanimal with the old totem animal. In a later age there were two kinds of\nsacrifices, those of domestic animals which usually were also eaten, and\nthe unusual sacrifice of animals which were forbidden as being unclean.\nFurther investigation then shows that these unclean animals were holy\nand that they were sacrificed to the gods to whom they were holy, that\nthese animals were originally identified with the gods themselves and\nthat at the sacrifice the worshippers in some way emphasized their blood\nrelationship to the god and to the animal. But this difference between\nusual and \u2018mystic\u2019 sacrifices does not hold good for still earlier\ntimes. Originally all animals were holy, their meat was forbidden and\nmight be eaten only on solemn occasions, with the participation of the\nwhole kin. The slaughter of the animal amounted to the spilling of the\nkin\u2019s blood and had to be done with the same precautions and assurances\nagainst reproach.\nThe taming of domestic animals and the rise of cattle-breeding seems\neverywhere to have put an end to the pure and rigorous totemism of\nearliest times[202]. But such holiness as still clung to domestic\nanimals in what was now a \u2018pastoral\u2019 religion, is sufficiently distinct\nfor us to recognize its totemic character. Even in late classical times\nthe rite in several localities prescribed flight for the sacrificer\nafter the sacrifice, as if to escape revenge. In Greece the idea must\nonce have been general that the killing of an ox was really a crime. At\nthe Athenian festival of the Bouphonia a formal trial, to which all the\nparticipants were summoned, was instituted after the sacrifice. Finally\nit was agreed to put the blame for the murder upon the knife, which was\nthen cast into the sea.\nIn spite of the dread which protects the life of the animal as being of\nkin, it became necessary to kill it from time to time in solemn\nconclave, and to divide its flesh and blood among the members of the\nclan. The motive which commands this act reveals the deepest meaning of\nthe essence of sacrifice. We have heard that in later times every eating\nin common, the participation in the same substance which entered into\ntheir bodies, established a holy bond between the communicants; in\noldest time this meaning seemed to be attached only to participation in\nthe substance of a holy sacrifice. _The holy mystery of the sacrificial\ndeath was justified in that only in this way could the holy bond be\nestablished which united the participants with each other and with their\ngod[203]._\nThis bond was nothing else than the life of the sacrificial animal which\nlived on its flesh and blood and was shared by all the participants by\nmeans of the sacrificial feast. Such an idea was the basis of all the\n_blood bonds_ through which men in still later times became pledged to\neach other. The thoroughly realistic conception of consanguinity as an\nidentity of substance makes comprehensible the necessity of renewing it\nfrom time to time through the physical process of the sacrificial\nrepast.\nWe will now stop quoting from Robertson Smith\u2019s train of thought in\norder to give a condensed summary of what is essential in it. When the\nidea of private property came into existence sacrifice was conceived as\na gift to the deity, as a transfer from the property of man to that of\nthe god. But this interpretation left all the peculiarities of the\nsacrificial ritual unexplained. In oldest times the sacrificial animal\nitself had been holy and its life inviolate; it could be taken only in\nthe presence of the god, with the whole tribe taking part and sharing\nthe guilt in order to furnish the holy substance through the eating of\nwhich the members of the clan assured themselves of their material\nidentity with each other and with the deity. The sacrifice was a\nsacrament, and the sacrificial animal itself was one of the kin. In\nreality it was the old totem animal, the primitive god himself through\nthe slaying and eating of whom the members of the clan revived and\nassured their similarity with the god.\nFrom this analysis of the nature of sacrifice Robertson Smith drew the\nconclusion that the periodic killing and eating of the totem before the\nperiod when the _anthropomorphic deities were venerated_ was an\nimportant part of totem religion. The ceremonial of such a totem feast\nwas preserved for us, he thought, in the description of a sacrifice in\nlater times. Saint Nilus tells of a sacrificial custom of the Bedouins\nin the desert of Sinai towards the end of the fourth century <small>A.D.</small> The\nvictim, a camel, was bound and laid upon a rough altar of stones; the\nleader of the tribe made the participants walk three times around the\naltar to the accompaniment of song, inflicted the first wound upon the\nanimal and greedily drank the spurting blood; then the whole community\nthrew itself upon the sacrifice, cut off pieces of the palpitating flesh\nwith their swords and ate them raw in such haste that in a short\ninterval between the rise of the morning star, for whom this sacrifice\nwas meant, and its fading before the rays of the sun, the whole\nsacrificial animal, flesh, skin, bones, and entrails, were devoured.\nAccording to every testimony this barbarous rite, which speaks of great\nantiquity, was not a rare custom but the general original form of the\ntotem sacrifice, which in later times underwent the most varied\nmodifications.\nMany authors have refused to grant any weight to this conception of the\ntotem feast because it could not be strengthened by direct observation\nat the stage of totemism. Robertson Smith himself has referred to\nexamples in which the sacramental meaning of sacrifices seems certain,\nsuch as the human sacrifices of the Aztecs and others which recall the\nconditions of the totem feast, the bear sacrifices of the bear tribe of\nthe _Ouataouaks_ in America, and the bear festival of the Ainus in\nJapan. Frazer has given a full account of these and similar cases in the\ntwo divisions of his great work that have last appeared[204]. An Indian\ntribe in California which reveres the buzzard, a large bird of prey,\nkills it once a year with solemn ceremony, whereupon the bird is mourned\nand its skin and feathers preserved. The Zuni Indians in New Mexico do\nthe same thing with their holy turtle.\nIn the _Intichiuma_ ceremonies of Central Australian tribes a trait has\nbeen observed which fits in excellently with the assumptions of\nRobertson Smith. Every tribe that practises magic for the increase of\nits totem, which it cannot eat itself, is bound to eat a part of its\ntotem at the ceremony before it can be touched by the other tribes.\nAccording to Frazer the best example of the sacramental consumption of\nthe otherwise forbidden totem is to be found among the Bini in West\nAfrica, in connexion with the burial ceremony of this tribe[205].\nBut we shall follow Robertson Smith in the assumption that the\nsacramental killing and the common consumption of the otherwise\nforbidden totem animal was an important trait of the totem\nreligion[206].\n5\nLet us now envisage the scene of such a totem meal and let us embellish\nit further with a few probable features which could not be adequately\nconsidered before. Thus we have the clan, which on a solemn occasion\nkills its totem in a cruel manner and eats it raw, blood, flesh, and\nbones. At the same time the members of the clan disguised in imitation\nof the totem, mimic it in sound and movement as if they wanted to\nemphasize their common identity. There is also the conscious realization\nthat an action is being carried out which is forbidden to each\nindividual and which can only be justified through the participation of\nall, so that no one is allowed to exclude himself from the killing and\nthe feast. After the act is accomplished the murdered animal is bewailed\nand lamented. The death lamentation is compulsive, being enforced by the\nfear of a threatening retribution, and its main purpose is, as Robertson\nSmith remarks on an analogous occasion, to exculpate oneself from\nresponsibility for the slaying[207].\nBut after this mourning there follows loud festival gaiety accompanied\nby the unchaining of every impulse and the permission of every\ngratification. Here we find an easy insight into the nature of the\n_holiday_.\nA holiday is permitted, or rather a prescribed excess, a solemn\nviolation of a prohibition. People do not commit the excesses which at\nall times have characterized holidays, as a result of an order to be in\na holiday mood, but because in the very nature of a holiday there is\nexcess; the holiday mood is brought about by the release of what is\notherwise forbidden.\nBut what has mourning over the death of the totem animal to do with the\nintroduction of this holiday spirit? If men are happy over the slaying\nof the totem, which is otherwise forbidden to them, why do they also\nmourn it?\nWe have heard that members of a clan become holy through the consumption\nof the totem and thereby also strengthen their identification with it\nand with each other. The fact that they have absorbed the holy life with\nwhich the substance of the totem is charged may explain the holiday mood\nand everything that results from it.\nPsychoanalysis has revealed to us that the totem animal is really a\nsubstitute for the father, and this really explains the contradiction\nthat it is usually forbidden to kill the totem animal, that the killing\nof it results in a holiday and that the animal is killed and yet\nmourned. The ambivalent emotional attitude which to-day still marks the\nfather complex in our children and so often continues into adult life\nalso extended to the father substitute of the totem animal.\nBut if we associate the translation of the totem as given by\npsychoanalysis, with the totem feast and the Darwinian hypothesis about\nthe primal state of human society, a deeper understanding becomes\npossible and a hypothesis is offered which may seem fantastic but which\nhas the advantage of establishing an unexpected unity among a series of\nhitherto separated phenomena.\nThe Darwinian conception of the primal horde does not, of course, allow\nfor the beginning of totemism. There is only a violent, jealous father\nwho keeps all the females for himself and drives away the growing sons.\nThis primal state of society has nowhere been observed. The most\nprimitive organization we know, which to-day is still in force with\ncertain tribes, is _associations of men_ consisting of members with\nequal rights, subject to the restrictions of the totemic system, and\nfounded on matriarchy, or descent through the mother[208]. Can the one\nhave resulted from the other, and how was this possible?\nBy basing our argument upon the celebration of the totem we are in a\nposition to give an answer: One day[209] the expelled brothers joined\nforces, slew and ate the father, and thus put an end to the father\nhorde. Together they dared and accomplished what would have remained\nimpossible for them singly. Perhaps some advance in culture, like the\nuse of a new weapon, had given them the feeling of superiority. Of\ncourse these cannibalistic savages ate their victim. This violent primal\nfather had surely been the envied and feared model for each of the\nbrothers. Now they accomplished their identification with him by\ndevouring him and each acquired a part of his strength. The totem feast,\nwhich is perhaps mankind\u2019s first celebration, would be the repetition\nand commemoration of this memorable, criminal act with which so many\nthings began, social organization, moral restrictions and\nreligion[210].\nIn order to find these results acceptable, quite aside from our\nsupposition, we need only assume that the group of brothers banded\ntogether were dominated by the same contradictory feelings towards the\nfather which we can demonstrate as the content of ambivalence of the\nfather complex in all our children and in neurotics. They hated the\nfather who stood so powerfully in the way of their sexual demands and\ntheir desire for power, but they also loved and admired him. After they\nhad satisfied their hate by his removal and had carried out their wish\nfor identification with him, the suppressed tender impulses had to\nassert themselves[211]. This took place in the form of remorse, a sense\nof guilt was formed which coincided here with the remorse generally\nfelt. The dead now became stronger than the living had been, even as we\nobserve it to-day in the destinies of men. What the fathers\u2019 presence\nhad formerly prevented they themselves now prohibited in the psychic\nsituation of \u2018subsequent obedience\u2019, which we know so well from\npsychoanalysis. They undid their deed by declaring that the killing of\nthe father substitute, the totem, was not allowed, and renounced the\nfruits of their deed by denying themselves the liberated women. Thus\nthey created the two fundamental taboos of totemism out of the _sense of\nguilt of the son_, and for this very reason these had to correspond with\nthe two repressed wishes of the Oedipus complex. Whoever disobeyed\nbecame guilty of the two only crimes which troubled primitive\nsociety[212].\nThe two taboos of totemism with which the morality of man begins are\npsychologically not of equal value. One of them, the sparing of the\ntotem animal, rests entirely upon emotional motives; the father had been\nremoved and nothing in reality could make up for this. But the other,\nthe incest prohibition, had, besides, a strong practical foundation.\nSexual need does not unite men; it separates them. Though the brothers\nhad joined forces in order to overcome the father, each was the other\u2019s\nrival among the women. Each one wanted to have them all to himself like\nthe father, and in the fight of each against the other the new\norganization would have perished. For there was no longer any one\nstronger than all the rest who could have successfully assumed the r\u00f4le\nof the father. Thus there was nothing left for the brothers, if they\nwanted to live together, but to erect the incest prohibition--perhaps\nafter many difficult experiences--through which they all equally\nrenounced the women whom they desired, and on account of whom they had\nremoved the father in the first place. Thus they saved the organization\nwhich had made them strong and which could be based upon the homo-sexual\nfeelings and activities which probably manifested themselves among them\nduring the time of their banishment. Perhaps this situation also formed\nthe germ of the institution of the mother right discovered by Bachofen,\nwhich was then abrogated by the patriarchal family arrangement.\nOn the other hand the claim of totemism to be considered the first\nattempt at a religion is connected with the other taboo which protects\nthe life of the totem animal. The feelings of the sons found a natural\nand appropriate substitute for the father in the animal, but their\ncompulsory treatment of it expressed more than the need of showing\nremorse. The surrogate for the father was perhaps used in the attempt\nto assuage the burning sense of guilt, and to bring about a kind of\nreconciliation with the father. The totemic system was a kind of\nagreement with the father in which the latter granted everything that\nthe child\u2019s phantasy could expect from him, protection, care, and\nforbearance, in return for which the pledge was given to honour his\nlife, that is to say, not to repeat the act against the totem through\nwhich the real father had perished. Totemism also contained an attempt\nat justification, \u201cIf the father had treated us like the totem we should\nnever have been tempted to kill him.\u201d Thus totemism helped to gloss over\nthe real state of affairs and to make one forget the event to which it\nowed its origin.\nIn this connexion some features were formed which henceforth determined\nthe character of every religion. The totem religion had issued from the\nsense of guilt of the sons as an attempt to palliate this feeling and to\nconciliate the injured father through subsequent obedience. All later\nreligions prove to be attempts to solve the same problem, varying only\nin accordance with the stage of culture in which they are attempted and\naccording to the paths which they take; they are all, however, reactions\naiming at the same great event with which culture began and which ever\nsince has not let mankind come to rest.\nThere is still another characteristic faithfully preserved in religion\nwhich already appeared in totemism at this time. The ambivalent strain\nwas probably too great to be adjusted by any arrangement, or else the\npsychological conditions are entirely unfavourable to any kind of\nsettlement of these contradictory feelings. It is certainly noticeable\nthat the ambivalence attached to the father complex also continues in\ntotemism and in religions in general. The religion of totemism included\nnot only manifestations of remorse and attempts at reconciliation, but\nalso serves to commemorate the triumph over the father. The\ngratification obtained thereby creates the commemorative celebration of\nthe totem feast at which the restrictions of subsequent obedience are\nsuspended, and makes it a duty to repeat the crime of parricide through\nthe sacrifice of the totem animal as often as the benefits of this deed,\nnamely, the appropriation of the father\u2019s properties, threaten to\ndisappear as a result of the changed influences of life. We shall not be\nsurprised to find that a part of the son\u2019s defiance also reappears,\noften in the most remarkable disguises and inversions, in the formation\nof later religions.\nIf thus far we have followed, in religion and moral precepts--but little\ndifferentiated in totemism--the consequences of the tender impulses\ntowards the father as they are changed into remorse, we must not\noverlook the fact that for the most part the tendencies which have\nimpelled to parricide have retained the victory. The social and\nfraternal feelings on which this great change is based, henceforth for\nlong periods exercises the greatest influence upon the development of\nsociety. They find expression in the sanctification of the common blood\nand in the emphasis upon the solidarity of life within the clan. In thus\nensuring each other\u2019s lives the brothers express the fact that no one of\nthem is to be treated by the other as they all treated the father. They\npreclude a repetition of the fate of the father. The socially\nestablished prohibition against fratricide is now added to the\nprohibition against killing the totem, which is based on religious\ngrounds. It will still be a long time before the commandment discards\nthe restriction to members of the tribe and assumes the simple\nphraseology: Thou shalt not kill. At first the _brother clan_ has taken\nthe place of the _father horde_ and was guaranteed by the blood bond.\nSociety is now based on complicity in the common crime, religion on the\nsense of guilt and the consequent remorse, while morality is based\npartly on the necessities of society and partly on the expiation which\nthis sense of guilt demands.\nThus psychoanalysis, contrary to the newer conceptions of the totemic\nsystem and more in accord with older conceptions, bids us argue for an\nintimate connexion between totemism and exogamy as well as for their\nsimultaneous origin.\n6\nI am under the influence of many strong motives which restrain me from\nthe attempt to discuss the further development of religions from their\nbeginning in totemism up to their present state. I shall follow out only\ntwo threads as I see them appearing in the weft with especial\ndistinctness: the motive of the totem sacrifice and the relation of the\nson to the father[213].\nRobertson Smith has shown us that the old totem feast returns in the\noriginal form of sacrifice. The meaning of the rite is the same:\nsanctification through participation in the common meal. The sense of\nguilt, which can only be allayed through the solidarity of all the\nparticipants, has also been retained. In addition to this there is the\ntribal deity in whose supposed presence the sacrifice takes place, who\ntakes part in the meal like a member of the tribe, and with whom\nidentification is effected by the act of eating the sacrifice. How does\nthe god come into this situation which originally was foreign to him?\nThe answer might be that the idea of god had meanwhile appeared,--no one\nknows whence--and had dominated the whole religious life, and that the\ntotem feast, like everything else that wished to survive, had been\nforced to fit itself into the new system. However, psychoanalytic\ninvestigation of the individual teaches with especial emphasis that god\nis in every case modelled after the father and that our personal\nrelation to god is dependent upon our relation to our physical,\nfluctuating and changing with him, and that god at bottom is nothing but\nan exalted father. Here also, as in the case of totemism, psychoanalysis\nadvises us to believe the faithful, who call god father just as they\ncalled the totem their ancestor. If psychoanalysis deserves any\nconsideration at all, then the share of the father in the idea of a god\nmust be very important, quite aside from all the other origins and\nmeanings of god upon which psychoanalysis can throw no light. But then\nthe father would be represented twice in primitive sacrifice, first as\ngod, and secondly as the totem-animalsacrifice, and we must ask, with\nall due regard for the limited number of solutions which psychoanalysis\noffers, whether this is possible and what the meaning of it may be.\nWe know that there are a number of relations of the god to the holy\nanimal (the totem and the sacrificial animal): 1. Usually one animal is\nsacred to every god, sometimes even several animals. 2. In certain,\nespecially holy, sacrifices, the so-called \u2018mystical\u2019 sacrifices, the\nvery animal which had been sanctified through the god was sacrificed to\nhim[214]. 3. The god was often revered in the form of an animal, or from\nanother point of view, animals enjoyed a godlike reverence long after\nthe period of totemism. 4. In myths the god is frequently transformed\ninto an animal, often into the animal that is sacred to him. From this\nthe assumption was obvious that the god himself was the animal, and that\nhe had evolved from the totem animal at a later stage of religious\nfeeling. But the reflection that the totem itself is nothing but a\nsubstitute for the father relieves us of all further discussion. Thus\nthe totem may have been the first form of the father substitute and the\ngod a later one in which the father regained his human form. Such a new\ncreation from the root of all religious evolution, namely, the longing\nfor the father, might become possible if in the course of time an\nessential change had taken place in the relation to the father and\nperhaps also to the animal.\nSuch changes are easily divined even if we disregard the beginning of a\npsychic estrangement from the animal as well as the disintegration of\ntotemism through animal domestication[215]. The situation created by the\nremoval of the father contained an element which in the course of time\nmust have brought about an extraordinary increase of longing for the\nfather. For the brothers who had joined forces to kill the father had\neach been animated by the wish to become like the father and had given\nexpression to this wish by incorporating parts of the substitute for him\nin the totem feast. In consequence of the pressure which the bonds of\nthe brother clan exercised upon each member, this wish had to remain\nunfulfilled. No one could or was allowed to attain the father\u2019s\nperfection of power, which was the thing they had all sought. Thus the\nbitter feeling against the father which had incited to the deed could\nsubside in the course of time, while the longing for him grew, and an\nideal could arise having as a content the fullness of power and the\nfreedom from restriction of the conquered primal father, as well as the\nwillingness to subject themselves to him. The original democratic\nequality of each member of the tribe could no longer be retained on\naccount of the interference of cultural changes; in consequence of which\nthere arose a tendency to revive the old father ideal in the creation of\ngods through the veneration of those individuals who had distinguished\nthemselves above the rest. That a man should become a god and that a god\nshould die, which to-day seems to us an outrageous presumption, was\nstill by no means offensive to the conceptions of classical\nantiquity[216]. But the deification of the murdered father from whom the\ntribe now derived its origin, was a much more serious attempt at\nexpiation than the former covenant with the totem.\nIn this evolution I am at a loss to indicate the place of the great\nmaternal deities who perhaps everywhere preceded the paternal deities.\nBut it seems certain that the change in the relation to the father was\nnot restricted to religion but logically extended to the other side of\nhuman life influenced by the removal of the father, namely, the social\norganization. With the institution of paternal deities the fatherless\nsociety gradually changed into a patriarchal one. The family was a\nreconstruction of the former primal horde and also restored a great part\nof their former rights to the fathers. Now there were patriarchs again\nbut the social achievements of the brother clan had not been given up\nand the actual difference between the new family patriarchs and the\nunrestricted primal father was great enough to ensure the continuation\nof the religious need, the preservation of the unsatisfied longing for\nthe father.\nThe father therefore really appears twice in the scene of sacrifice\nbefore the tribal god, once as the god and again as the\ntotem-sacrificial-animal. But in attempting to understand this situation\nwe must beware of interpretations which superficially seek to translate\nit as an allegory, and which forget the historical stages in the\nprocess. The twofold presence of the father corresponds to the two\nsuccessive meanings of the scene. The ambivalent attitude towards the\nfather as well as the victory of the son\u2019s tender emotional feelings\nover his hostile ones, have here found plastic expression. The scene of\nvanquishing the father, his greatest degradation, furnishes here the\nmaterial to represent his highest triumph. The meaning which sacrifice\nhas quite generally acquired is found in the fact that in the very same\naction which continues the memory of this misdeed it offers satisfaction\nto the father for the ignominy put upon him.\nIn the further development the animal loses its sacredness and the\nsacrifice its relation to the celebration of the totem; the rite becomes\na simple offering to the deity, a self-deprivation in favour of the god.\nGod himself is now so exalted above man that he can be communicated with\nonly through a priest as intermediary. At the same time the social order\nproduces godlike kings who transfer the patriarchal system to the state.\nIt must be said that the revenge of the deposed and reinstated father\nhas been very cruel; it culminated in the dominance of authority. The\nsubjugated sons have used the new relation to disburden themselves still\nmore of their sense of guilt. Sacrifice, as it is now constituted, is\nentirely beyond their responsibility. God himself has demanded and\nordained it. Myths in which the god himself kills the animal that is\nsacred to him, which he himself really is, belong to this phase. This is\nthe greatest possible denial of the great misdeed with which society and\nthe sense of guilt began. There is an unmistakable second meaning in\nthis sacrificial demonstration. It expresses satisfaction at the fact\nthat the earlier father substitute has been abandoned in favour of the\nhigher conception of god. The superficial allegorical translation of the\nscene here roughly corresponds with its psychoanalytic interpretation by\nsaying that god is represented as overcoming the animal part of his\nnature[217].\nBut it would be erroneous to believe that in this period of renewed\npatriarchal authority the hostile impulses which belong to the father\ncomplex had entirely subsided. On the contrary, the first phases in the\ndomination of the two new substitutive formations for the father, those\nof gods and kings, plainly show the most energetic expression of that\nambivalence which is characteristic of religion.\nIn his great work, _The Golden Bough_, Frazer has expressed the\nconjecture that the first kings of the Latin tribes were strangers who\nplayed the part of a deity and were solemnly sacrificed in this r\u00f4le on\nspecified holidays. The yearly sacrifice (self-sacrifice is a variant)\nof a god seems to have been an important feature of Semitic religions.\nThe ceremony of human sacrifice in various parts of the inhabited world\nmakes it certain that these human beings ended their lives as\nrepresentatives of the deity. This sacrificial custom can still be\ntraced in later times in the substitution of an inanimate imitation\n(doll) for the living person. The theanthropic god sacrifice into which\nunfortunately I cannot enter with the same thoroughness with which the\nanimal sacrifice has been treated throws the clearest light upon the\nmeaning of the older forms of sacrifice. It acknowledges with\nunsurpassable candour that the object of the sacrificial action has\nalways been the same, being identical with what is now revered as a god,\nnamely with the father. The question as to the relation of animal to\nhuman sacrifice can now be easily solved. The original animal sacrifice\nwas already a substitute for a human sacrifice, for the solemn killing\nof the father, and when the father substitute regained its human form,\nthe animal substitute could also be retransformed into a human\nsacrifice.\nThus the memory of that first great act of sacrifice had proved to be\nindestructible despite all attempts to forget it, and just at the\nmoment when men strove to get as far away as possible from its motives,\nthe undistorted repetition of it had to appear in the form of the god\nsacrifice. I need not fully indicate here the developments of religious\nthought which made this return possible in the form of rationalizations.\nRobertson Smith who is, of course, far removed from the idea of tracing\nsacrifice back to this great event of man\u2019s primal history, says that\nthe ceremony of the festivals in which the old Semites celebrated the\ndeath of a deity were interpreted as \u201ca commemoration of a mythical\ntragedy\u201d and that the attendant lament was not characterized by\nspontaneous sympathy, but displayed a compulsive character, something\nthat was imposed by the fear of a divine wrath[218]. We are in a\nposition to acknowledge that this interpretation was correct, the\nfeelings of the celebrants being well explained by the basic situation.\nWe may now accept it as a fact that in the further development of\nreligions these two inciting factors, the son\u2019s sense of guilt and his\ndefiance, were never again extinguished. Every attempted solution of the\nreligious problem and every kind of reconciliation of the two opposing\npsychic forces gradually falls to the ground, probably under the\ncombined influence of cultural changes, historical events, and inner\npsychic transformations.\nThe endeavour of the son to put himself in place of the father god,\nappeared with greater and greater distinctness. With the introduction of\nagriculture the importance of the son in the patriarchal family\nincreased. He was emboldened to give new expression to his incestuous\nlibido which found symbolic satisfaction in labouring over mother earth.\nThere came into existence figures of gods like Attis, Adonis, Tammuz,\nand others, spirits of vegetation as well as youthful divinities who\nenjoyed the favours of maternal deities and committed incest with the\nmother in defiance of the father. But the sense of guilt which was not\nallayed through these creations, was expressed in myths which visited\nthese youthful lovers of the maternal goddesses with short life and\npunishment through castration or through the wrath of the father god\nappearing in animal form. Adonis was killed by the boar, the sacred\nanimal of Aphrodite; Attis, the lover of Kybele, died of\ncastration[219]. The lamentation for these gods and the joy at their\nresurrection have gone over into the ritual of another son which\ndivinity was destined to survive long.\nWhen Christianity began its entry into the ancient world it met with the\ncompetition of the religion of Mithras and for a long time it was\ndoubtful which deity was to be the victor.\nThe bright figure of the youthful Persian god has eluded our\nunderstanding. Perhaps we may conclude from the illustrations of Mithras\nslaying the steers that he represented the son who carried out the\nsacrifice of the father by himself and thus released the brothers from\ntheir oppressing complicity in the deed. There was another way of\nallaying this sense of guilt and this is the one that Christ took. He\nsacrificed his own life and thereby redeemed the brothers from primal\nsin.\nThe theory of primal sin is of Orphic origin; it was preserved in the\nmysteries and thence penetrated into the philosophic schools of Greek\nantiquity[220]. Men were the descendants of Titans, who had killed and\ndismembered the young Dionysos-Zagreus; the weight of this crime\noppressed them. A fragment of Anaximander says that the unity of the\nworld was destroyed by a primordial crime and everything that issued\nfrom it must carry on the punishment for this crime[221]. Although the\nfeatures of banding together, killing, and dismembering as expressed in\nthe deed of the Titans very clearly recall the totem sacrifice described\nby St Nilus--as also many other myths of antiquity, for example, the\ndeath of Orpheus himself--we are nevertheless disturbed here by the\nvariation according to which a youthful god was murdered.\nIn the Christian myth man\u2019s original sin is undoubtedly an offence\nagainst God the Father, and if Christ redeems mankind from the weight of\noriginal sin by sacrificing his own life, he forces us to the conclusion\nthat this sin was murder. According to the law of retaliation which is\ndeeply rooted in human feeling, a murder can be atoned only by the\nsacrifice of another life; the self-sacrifice points to a\nblood-guilt[222]. And if this sacrifice of one\u2019s own life brings about\na reconciliation with god, the father, then the crime which must be\nexpiated can only have been the murder of the father.\nThus in the Christian doctrine mankind most unreservedly acknowledges\nthe guilty deed of primordial times because it now has found the most\ncomplete expiation for this deed in the sacrificial death of the son.\nThe reconciliation with the father is the more thorough because\nsimultaneously with this sacrifice there follows the complete\nrenunciation of woman, for whose sake mankind rebelled against the\nfather. But now also the psychological fatality of ambivalence demands\nits rights. In the same deed which offers the greatest possible\nexpiation to the father, the son also attains the goal of his wishes\nagainst the father. He becomes a god himself beside or rather in place\nof his father. The religion of the son succeeds the religion of the\nfather. As a sign of this substitution the old totem feast is revived\nagain in the form of communion in which the band of brothers now eats\nthe flesh and blood of the son and no longer that of the father, the\nsons thereby identifying themselves with him and becoming holy\nthemselves. Thus through the ages we see the identity of the totem\nfeast with the animal sacrifice, the theanthropic human sacrifice, and\nthe Christian eucharist, and in all these solemn occasions we recognize\nthe after-effects of that crime which so oppressed men but of which they\nmust have been so proud. At bottom, however, the Christian communion is\na new setting aside of the father, a repetition of the crime that must\nbe expiated. We see how well justified is Frazer\u2019s dictum that \u201cthe\nChristian communion has absorbed within itself a sacrament which is\ndoubtless far older than Christianity\u201d[223].\n7\nA process like the removal of the primal father by the band of brothers\nmust have left ineradicable traces in the history of mankind and must\nhave expressed itself the more frequently in numerous substitutive\nformations the less it itself was to be remembered.[224] I am avoiding\nthe temptation of pointing out these traces in mythology, where they are\nnot hard to find, and am turning to another field in following a hint of\nS. Reinach in his suggestive treatment of the death of Orpheus[225].\nThere is a situation in the history of Greek art which is strikingly\nfamiliar even if profoundly divergent, to the scene of a totem feast\ndiscovered by Robertson Smith. It is the situation of the oldest Greek\ntragedy. A group of persons, all of the same name and dressed in the\nsame way, surround a single figure upon whose words and actions they are\ndependent, to represent the chorus and the original single impersonator\nof the hero. Later developments created a second and a third actor in\norder to represent opponents in playing, and off-shoots of the hero, but\nthe character of the hero as well as his relation to the chorus remains\nunchanged. The hero of the tragedy had to suffer; this is to-day still\nthe essential content of a tragedy. He had taken upon himself the\nso-called \u2018tragic guilt\u2019, which is not always easy to explain; it is\noften not a guilt in the ordinary sense. Almost always it consisted of a\nrebellion against a divine or human authority and the chorus accompanied\nthe hero with their sympathies, trying to restrain and warn him, and\nlamented his fate after he had met with what was considered fitting\npunishment for his daring attempt.\nBut why did the hero of the tragedy have to suffer, and what was the\nmeaning of his \u2018tragic\u2019 guilt? We will cut short the discussion by a\nprompt answer. He had to suffer because he was the primal father, the\nhero of that primordial tragedy the repetition of which here serves a\ncertain tendency, and the tragic guilt is the guilt which he had to take\nupon himself in order to free the chorus of theirs. The scene upon the\nstage came into being through purposive distortion of the historical\nscene or, one is tempted to say, it was the result of refined hypocrisy.\nActually, in the old situation, it was the members of the chorus\nthemselves who had caused the suffering of the hero; here, on the other\nhand, they exhaust themselves in sympathy and regret, and the hero\nhimself is to blame for his suffering. The crime foisted upon him,\nnamely, presumption and rebellion against a great authority, is the same\nas that which in the past oppressed the colleagues of the chorus,\nnamely, the band of brothers. Thus the tragic hero, though still against\nhis will, is made the redeemer of the chorus.\nWhen one bears in mind the suffering of the divine goat Dionysos in the\nperformance of the Greek tragedy and the lament of the retinue of goats\nwho identified themselves with him, one can easily understand how the\nalmost extinct drama was reviewed in the Middle Ages in the Passion of\nChrist.\nIn closing this study, which has been carried out in extremely condensed\nform, I want to state the conclusion that the beginnings of religion,\nethics, society, and art meet in the Oedipus complex. This is in entire\naccord with the findings of psychoanalysis, namely, that the nucleus of\nall neuroses as far as our present knowledge of them goes is the Oedipus\ncomplex. It comes as a great surprise to me that these problems of\nracial psychology can also be solved through a single concrete instance,\nsuch as the relation to the father. Perhaps another psychological\nproblem must be included here. We have so frequently had occasion to\nshow the ambivalence of emotions in its real sense, that is to say the\ncoincidence of love and hate towards the same object, at the root of\nimportant cultural formations. We know nothing about the origin of this\nambivalence. It may be assumed to be a fundamental phenomenon of our\nemotional life. But the other possibility seems to me also worthy of\nconsideration: that ambivalence, originally foreign to our emotional\nlife was acquired by mankind from the father complex[226], where\npsychoanalytic investigation of the individual to-day still reveals the\nstrongest expression of it[227].\nBefore closing we must take into account that the remarkable convergence\nreached in these illustrations, pointing to a single inclusive relation,\nought not to blind us to the uncertainties of our assumptions and to the\ndifficulties of our conclusions. Of these difficulties I will point out\nonly two which must have forced themselves upon many readers.\nIn the first place it can hardly have escaped any one that we base\neverything upon the assumption of a psyche of the mass in which psychic\nprocesses occur as in the psychic life of the individual. Moreover, we\nlet the sense of guilt for a deed survive for thousands of years,\nremaining effective in generations which could not have known anything\nof this deed. We allow an emotional process such as might have arisen\namong generations of sons that had been ill-treated by their fathers, to\ncontinue to new generations which had escaped such treatment by the very\nremoval of the father. These seem indeed to be weighty objections and\nany other explanation which can avoid such assumptions would seem to\nmerit preference.\nBut further consideration shows that we ourselves do not have to carry\nthe whole responsibility for such daring. Without the assumption of a\nmass psyche, or a continuity in the emotional life of mankind which\npermits us to disregard the interruptions of psychic acts through the\ntransgression of individuals, social psychology could not exist at all.\nIf psychic processes of one generation did not continue in the next, if\neach had to acquire its attitude towards life afresh, there would be no\nprogress in this field and almost no development. We are now confronted\nby two new questions: how much can be attributed to this psychic\ncontinuity within the series of generations, and what ways and means\ndoes a generation use to transfer its psychic states to the next\ngeneration? I do not claim that these problems have been sufficiently\nexplained or that direct communication and tradition, of which one\nimmediately thinks, are adequate for the task. Social psychology is in\ngeneral little concerned with the manner in which the required\ncontinuity in the psychic life of succeeding generations is established.\nA part of the task seems to be performed by the inheritance of psychic\ndispositions which, however, need certain incentives in the individual\nlife in order to become effective. This may be the meaning of the poet\u2019s\nwords: \u201cStrive to possess yourself of what you have inherited from your\nancestors.\u201d The problem would appear more difficult if we could admit\nthat there are psychic impulses which can be so completely suppressed\nthat they leave no traces whatsoever behind them. But that does not\nexist. The greatest suppression must leave room for distorted\nsubstitutions and their resulting reactions. But in that case we may\nassume that no generation is capable of concealing its more important\npsychic processes from the next. For psychoanalysis has taught us that\nin his unconscious psychic activity every person possesses an apparatus\nwhich enables him to interpret the reactions of others, that is to say,\nto straighten out the distortions which the other person has affected in\nthe expression of his feelings. By this method of unconscious\nunderstanding of all customs, ceremonies, and laws which the original\nrelation to the primal father had left behind, later generations may\nalso have succeeded in taking over this legacy of feelings.\nThere is another objection which the analytic method of thought itself\nmight raise.\nWe have interpreted the first rules of morality and moral restrictions\nof primitive society as reactions to a deed which gave the authors of it\nthe conception of crime. They regretted this deed and decided that it\nshould not be repeated and that its execution must bring no gain. This\ncreative sense of guilt has not become extinct with us. We find its\nasocial effects in neurotics producing new rules of morality and\ncontinued restrictions, in expiation for misdeeds committed, or as\nprecautions against misdeeds to be committed[228]. But when we examine\nthese neurotics for the deeds which have called forth such reactions, we\nare disappointed. We do not find deeds, but only impulses and feelings\nwhich sought evil but which were restrained from carrying it out. Only\npsychic realities and not actual ones are at the basis of the neurotics\u2019\nsense of guilt. It is characteristic of the neurosis to put a psychic\nreality above an actual one and to react as seriously to thoughts as the\nnormal person reacts only towards realities.\nMay it not be true that the case was somewhat the same with primitive\nmen? We are justified in ascribing to them an extraordinary\nover-valuation of their psychic acts as a partial manifestation of their\nnarcistic organization[229]. According to this the mere impulses of\nhostility towards the father and the existence of the wish phantasy to\nkill and devour him may have sufficed to bring about the moral reaction\nwhich has created totemism and taboo. We should thus escape the\nnecessity of tracing back the beginning of our cultural possession, of\nwhich we rightly are so proud, to a horrible crime which wounds all our\nfeelings. The causal connexion, which stretches from that beginning to\nthe present time, would not be impaired, for the psychic reality would\nbe of sufficient importance to account for all those consequences. It\nmay be agreed that a change has really taken place in the form of\nsociety from the father horde to the brother clan. This is a strong\nargument, but it is not conclusive. The change might have been\naccomplished in a less violent manner and still have conditioned the\nappearance of the moral reaction. As long as the pressure of the primal\nfather was felt the hostile feelings against him were justified and\nrepentance at these feelings had to wait for another opportunity. Of as\nlittle validity is the second objection, that everything derived from\nthe ambivalent relation to the father, namely taboos, and rules of\nsacrifice, is characterized by the highest seriousness and by complete\nreality. The ceremonials and inhibitions of compulsion neurotics exhibit\nthis characteristic too and yet they go back to a merely psychic\nreality, to resolution and not to execution. We must beware of\nintroducing the contempt for what is merely thought or wished which\ncharacterizes our sober world where there are only material values, into\nthe world of primitive man and the neurotic, which is full of inner\nriches only.\nWe face a decision here which is really not easy. But let us begin by\nacknowledging that the difference which may seem fundamental to others\ndoes not, in our judgment, touch the most important part of the subject.\nIf wishes and impulses have the full value of fact for primitive man, it\nis for us to follow such a conception intelligently instead of\ncorrecting it according to our standard. But in that case we must\nscrutinize more closely the prototype of the neurosis itself which is\nresponsible for having raised this doubt. It is not true that compulsion\nneurotics, who to-day are under the pressure of over-morality, defend\nthemselves only against the psychic reality of temptations and punish\nthemselves for impulses which they have only felt. A piece of historic\nreality is also involved; in their childhood these persons had nothing\nbut evil impulses and as far as their childish impotence permitted they\nput them into action. Each of these over-good persons had a period of\nbadness in his childhood, and a perverse phase as a fore-runner and a\npremise of the latter over morality. The analogy between primitive men\nand neurotics is therefore much more fundamentally established if we\nassume that with the former, too, the psychic reality, concerning whose\nstructure there is no doubt, originally coincided with the actual\nreality, and that primitive men really did what according to all\ntestimony they intended to do.\nBut we must not let our judgment about primitive men be influenced too\nfar by the analogy with neurotics. Differences must also be taken into\naccount. Of course the sharp division between thinking and doing as we\ndraw it does not exist either with savages or with neurotics. But the\nneurotic is above all inhibited in his actions; with him the thought is\na complete substitute for the deed. Primitive man is not inhibited, the\nthought is directly converted into the deed, the deed is for him so to\nspeak rather a substitute for the thought, and for that reason I think\nwe may well assume in the case we are discussing, though without\nvouching for the absolute certainty of the decision, that \u201cIn the\nbeginning was the deed\u201d.\nTHE END\n_Printed in Great Britain by_ Butler & Tanner, _Frome and London_\nFOOTNOTES:\n[1] Jung: _Wandlungen and Symbole der Libido_ (Transformations and\nSymbols of the Libido) translated by Dr. Beatrice Hinkle under the title\n_The Psychology of the Unconscious_, and _Principles of Psychoanalysis,\nNervous and Mental Diseases_.\n[2] _The History of the Psychoanalytic Movement_, translated by A.

The\nname Totem or Totam was first learned from the North American Indians by\nthe Englishman, J. Long, in 1791. The subject has gradually acquired\ngreat scientific interest and has called forth a copious literature. I\nrefer especially to _Totemism and Exogamy_ by J. G. Frazer, 4 vols.,\n1910, and the books and articles of Andrew Lang (_The Secret of Totem_,\n1905). The credit for having recognized the significance of totemism for\nthe ancient history of man belongs to the Scotchman, J. Ferguson\nMacLennan (_Fortnightly Review_, 1869-70). Exterior to Australia,\ntotemic institutions were found and are still observed among North\nAmerican Indians, as well as among the races of the Polynesian Islands\ngroup, in East India, and in a large part of Africa. Many traces and\nsurvivals otherwise hard to interpret lead to the conclusion that\ntotemism also once existed among the aboriginal Aryan and Semitic races\nof Europe, so that many investigators are inclined to recognize in\ntotemism a necessary phase of human development through which every race\nhas passed.\nHow then did prehistoric man come to acquire a totem; that is, how did\nhe come to make his descent from this or that animal foundation of his\nsocial duties and, as we shall hear, of his sexual restrictions as well?\nMany different theories have been advanced to explain this, a review of\nwhich the reader may find in Wundt\u2019s _Voelkerpsychologie_ (Vol. II:\n_Mythus und Religion_).\nI promise soon to make the problem of totemism a subject of special\nstudy in which an effort will be made to solve it by applying the\npsychoanalytic method. (Cf. The fourth chapter of this work.)\nNot only is the theory of totemism controversial, but the very facts\nconcerning it are hardly to be expressed in such general statements as\nwere attempted above. There is hardly an assertion to which one would\nnot have to add exceptions and contradictions. But it must not be\nforgotten that even the most primitive and conservative races are, in a\ncertain sense, old, and have a long period behind them during which\nwhatsoever was aboriginal with them has undergone much development and\ndistortion. Thus among those races who still evince it, we find totemism\nto-day in the most manifold states of decay and disintegration; we\nobserve that fragments of it have passed over to other social and\nreligious institutions; or it may exist in fixed forms but far removed\nfrom its original nature. The difficulty then consists in the fact that\nit is not altogether easy to decide what in the actual conditions is to\nbe taken as a faithful copy of the significant past and what is to be\nconsidered as a secondary distortion of it.\n[11] Frazer, _l.c._, p. 54.\n[12] But the father, who is a Kangaroo, is free--at least under this\nprohibition--to commit incest with his daughters, who are Emu. In the\ncase of paternal inheritance of the totem the father would be Kangaroo\nas well as the children; then incest with the daughters would be\nforbidden to the father and incest with the mother would be left open to\nthe son. These consequences of the totem prohibition seem to indicate\nthat the maternal inheritance is older than the paternal one, for there\nare grounds for assuming that the totem prohibitions are directed first\nof all against the incestuous desires of the son.\n[13] Second edition, 1902.\n[14] _The Native Tribes of Central Australia_ (London, 1899).\n[15] The number of totems is arbitrarily chosen.\n[16] Article _Totemism_ in _Encyclopedia Britannica_, eleventh edition,\n1911 (A.

He explains this by showing that these drawings are in the\ndarkest and most inaccessible part of the caves and that representations\nof feared beasts of prey are absent. \u201cLes modernes parlent souvent, par\nhyperbole, de la magie du pinceau ou du ciseau d\u2019un grand artiste et, en\ng\u00e9n\u00e9ral, de la magie de l\u2019art.

Not all the observers were familiar with the\nlanguages but had to use the assistance of interpreters or else had to\ncommunicate with the people they questioned in the auxiliary language of\npidgin-English. Savages are not communicative about the most intimate\naffairs of their culture and unburden themselves only to those\nforeigners who have passed many years in their midst. From various\nmotives they often give wrong or misleading information, (Compare\nFrazer, _The Beginnings of Religion and Totemism Among the Australian\nAborigines_; _Fortnightly Review_, 1905; _Totemism and Exogamy_, Vol. I,\np. 150).--It must not be forgotten that primitive races are not young\nraces but really are as old as the most civilized, and that we have no\nright to expect that they have preserved their original ideas and\ninstitutions for our information without any evolution or distortion. It\nis certain, on the contrary, that far-reaching changes in all directions\nhave taken place among primitive races, so that we can never\nunhesitatingly decide which of their present conditions and opinions\nhave preserved the original past, having remained petrified, as it were,\nand which represent a distortion and change of the original. It is due\nto this that one meets the many disputes among authors as to what\nproportion of the peculiarities of a primitive culture is to be taken as\na primary, and what as a later and secondary manifestation. To establish\nthe original conditions, therefore, always remains a matter of\nconstruction. Finally, it is not easy to adapt oneself to the ways of\nthinking of primitive races. For like children, we easily misunderstand\nthem, and are always inclined to interpret their acts and feelings\naccording to our own psychic constellations.\n[137] _Totemism_ (Edinburgh, 1887), reprinted in the first volume of his\ngreat study, _Totemism and Exogamy_.\n[138] Compare the chapter on Taboo.\n[139] Just as to-day we still have the wolves in a cage at the steps of\nthe Capitol in Rome and the bears in the pit at Berne.\n[140] Like the legend of the white woman in many noble families.\n[141] _l.c._, p. 35.--See the discussion of sacrifice further on.\n[142] See Chapter I.\n[143] p. 116.\n[144] The conclusion which Frazer draws about totemism in his second\nwork on the subject (_The Origin of Totemism; Fortnightly Review_, 1899)\nagrees with this text: \u201cThus, totemism has commonly been treated as a\nprimitive system both of religion and of society. As a system of\nreligion it embraces the mystic union of the savage with his totem; as a\nsystem of society it comprises the relations in which men and women of\nthe same totem stand to each other and to the members of other totemic\ngroups. And corresponding to these two sides of the system are two\nrough-and-ready tests or canons of totemism: first, the rule that a man\nmay not kill or eat his totem animal or plant, and second, the rule that\nhe may not marry or cohabit with a woman of the same totem\u201d (p. 101).\nFrazer then adds something which takes us into the midst of the\ndiscussion about totemism: \u201cWhether the two sides--the religious and the\nsocial--have always coexisted or are essentially independent, is a\nquestion which has been variously answered.\u201d\n[145] In connexion with such a change of opinion Frazer made this\nexcellent statement: \u201cThat my conclusions on these difficult questions\nare final, I am not so foolish as to pretend. I have changed my views\nrepeatedly, and I am resolved to change them again with every change of\nthe evidence, for like a chameleon the inquirer should shift his colours\nwith the shifting colours of the ground he treads.\u201d Preface to Vol. I,\n_Totemism and Exogamy_, 1910.\n[146] \u201cBy the nature of the case, as the origin of totemism lies far\nbeyond our powers of historical examination or of experiment, we must\nhave recourse as regards this matter, to conjecture,\u201d Andrew Lang,\n_Secret of the Totem_, p. 27.--\u201cNowhere do we see absolutely primitive\nman, and a totemic system in the making,\u201d p. 29.\n[147] At first probably only animals.\n[148] _The Worship of Animals and Plants_ (_Fortnightly Review_,\n1869-1870). _Primitive Marriage_, 1865; both works reprinted in _Studies\nin Ancient History_, 1876; second edition, 1886.\n[149] _The Secret of the Totem_, 1905, p. 34.\n[150] _Ibid._\n[151] _Ibid._\n[152] According to Andrew Lang.\n[153] Pikler and Soml\u00f3, _The Origin of Totemism_, 1901.

A horde as yet weak in their impubescence they are, but\nthey would, when strength was gained with time, inevitably wrench by\ncombined attacks, renewed again and again, both wife and life from the\npaternal tyrant\u201d (_Primal Law_, pp. 220-1). Atkinson, who spent his life\nin New Caledonia and had unusual opportunities to study the natives,\nalso refers to the fact that the conditions of the primal horde which\nDarwin assumes can easily be observed among herds of wild cattle and\nhorses and regularly lead to the killing of the father animal. He then\nassumes further that a disintegration of the horde took place after the\nremoval of the father through embittered fighting among the victorious\nsons, which thus precluded the origin of a new organization of society;\n\u201cAn ever recurring violent succession to the solitary paternal tyrant by\nsons, whose parricidal hands were so soon again clenched in fratricidal\nstrife\u201d (p. 228). Atkinson, who did not have the suggestions of\npsychoanalysis at his command and did not know the studies of Robertson\nSmith, finds a less violent transition from the primal horde to the next\nsocial stage in which many men live together in peaceful accord. He\nattributes it to maternal love that at first only the youngest sons and\nlater others too remain in the horde, who in return for this toleration\nacknowledge the sexual prerogative of the father by the restraint which\nthey practise towards the mother and towards their sisters.\nSo much for the very remarkable theory of Atkinson, its essential\ncorrespondence with the theory here expounded, and its point of\ndeparture which makes it necessary to relinquish so much else.\nI must ascribe the indefiniteness, the disregard of time interval, and\nthe crowding of the material in the above exposition to a restraint\nwhich the nature of the subject demands. It would be just as meaningless\nto strive for exactness in this material as it would be unfair to demand\ncertainty here.\n[211] This new emotional attitude must also have been responsible for\nthe fact that the deed could not bring full satisfaction to any of the\nperpetrators. In a certain sense it had been in vain. For none of the\nsons could carry out his original wish of taking the place of the\nfather. But failure is, as we know, much more favourable to moral\nreaction than success.\n[212] \u201cMurder and incest, or offences of like kind against the sacred\nlaw of blood are in primitive society the only crimes of which the\ncommunity as such takes cognizance ...\u201d _Religion of the Semites_, p.\n419.\n[213] Compare _Transformations and Symbols of the Libido_, by C. G.\nJung, in which some dissenting points of view are represented.\n[214] Robertson Smith, _Religion of the Semites_, Second Edition, 1907.\n[215] See above, p. 128.\n[216] \u201cTo us moderns, for whom the breach which divides the human and\ndivine has deepened into an impassable gulf, such mimicry may appear\nimpious, but it was otherwise with the ancients. To their thinking gods\nand men were akin, for many families traced their descent from a\ndivinity, and the deification of a man probably seemed as little\nextraordinary to them as the canonization of a saint seems to a modern\nCatholic.\u201d Frazer, _The Golden Bough_, I; _The Magic Art and the\nEvolution of Kings_, II, p. 177.\n[217] It is known that the overcoming of one generation of gods by\nanother in mythology represents the historical process of the\nsubstitution of one religious system by another, either as the result of\nconquest by a strange race or by means of a psychological development.\nIn the latter case the myth approaches the \u201cfunctional phenomena\u201d in H.\nSilberer\u2019s sense. That the god who kills the animal is a symbol of the\nlibido, as asserted by C. G. Jung (_l.c._), presupposes a different\nconception of the libido from that hitherto held, and at any rate seems\nto me questionable.\n[218] _Religion of the Semites_, pp. 412-413. \u201cThe mourning is not a\nspontaneous expression of sympathy with the divine tragedy, but\nobligatory and enforced by fear of supernatural anger. And a chief\nobject of the mourners is _to disclaim responsibility for the god\u2019s\ndeath_--a point which has already come before us in connexion with\ntheanthropic sacrifices, such as the \u2018ox-murder at Athens.\u2019\u201d\n[219] The fear of castration plays an extraordinarily big r\u00f4le in\ndisturbing the relations to the father in the case of our youthful\nneurotics. In Ferenczi\u2019s excellent study we have seen how the boy\nrecognized his totem in the animal which snaps at his little penis. When\nchildren learn about ritual circumcision they identify it with\ncastration. To my knowledge the parallel in the psychology of races to\nthis attitude of our children has not yet been drawn. The circumcision\nwhich was so frequent in primordial times among primitive races belongs\nto the period of initiation in which its meaning is to be found; it has\nonly secondarily been relegated to an earlier time of life. It is very\ninteresting that among primitive men circumcision is combined with or\nreplaced by the cutting off of the hair and the drawing of teeth, and\nthat our children, who cannot know anything about this, really treat\nthese two operations as equivalents to castration when they display\ntheir fear of them.\n[220] Reinach, _Cultes, Mythes, et Religions_, II, p. 75.\n[221] \u201cUne sorte de p\u00e9ch\u00e9 proethnique,\u201d _l.c._, p. 76.\n[222] The suicidal impulses of our neurotics regularly prove to be\nself-punishments for death wishes directed against others.\n[223] _Eating the God_, p. 51....

{"text": "PREFACE TO THE THIRD EDITION\nWhereas a period of nine years elapsed between the first and second\neditions of this book, the need for a third edition has appeared after\nlittle more than a year. I have reason to be pleased with this change;\nbut, just as I have not considered the earlier neglect of my work on the\npart of the reader as a proof of its unworthiness, I am unable to find\nin the interest manifested at present a proof of its excellence.\nThe progress in scientific knowledge has shown its influence on the\n_Interpretation of Dreams_. When I wrote it in 1899 the \u201cSexual\nTheories\u201d was not yet in existence, and the analysis of complicated\nforms of psychoneuroses was still in its infancy. The interpretation of\ndreams was destined to aid in the psychological analysis of the\nneuroses, but since then the deeper understanding of the neuroses has\nreacted on our conception of the dream. The study of dream\ninterpretation itself has continued to develop in a direction upon which\nnot enough stress was laid in the first edition of this book. From my\nown experience, as well as from the works of W. Stekel and others, I\nhave since learned to attach a greater value to the extent and the\nsignificance of symbolism in dreams (or rather in the unconscious\nthinking). Thus much has accumulated in the course of this year which\nrequires consideration. I have endeavoured to do justice to this new\nmaterial by numerous insertions in the text and by the addition of\nfootnotes. If these supplements occasionally threaten to warp the\noriginal discussion, or if, even with their aid, we have been\nunsuccessful in raising the original text to the _niveau_ of our present\nviews, I must beg indulgence for the gaps in the book, as they are only\nconsequences and indications of the present rapid development of our\nknowledge. I also venture to foretell in what other directions later\neditions of the _Interpretation of Dreams_\u2014in case any should be\ndemanded\u2014will differ from the present one. They will have, on the one\nhand, to include selections from the rich material of poetry, myth,\nusage of language, and folk-lore, and, on the other hand, to treat more\nprofoundly the relations of the dream to the neuroses and to mental\ndiseases.\nMr. Otto Rank has rendered me valuable service in the selection of the\naddenda and in reading the proof sheets. I am gratefully indebted to him\nand to many others for their contributions and corrections.\nVIENNA, Spring of 1911.\nTRANSLATOR\u2019S PREFACE\nSince the appearance of the author\u2019s _Selected Papers on Hysteria and\nother Psychoneuroses_, and _Three Contributions to the Sexual\nTheory_,[A] much has been said and written about Freud\u2019s works. Some of\nour readers have made an honest endeavour to test and utilise the\nauthor\u2019s theories, but they have been handicapped by their inability to\nread fluently very difficult German, for only two of Freud\u2019s works have\nhitherto been accessible to English readers. For them this work will be\nof invaluable assistance. To be sure, numerous articles on the Freudian\npsychology have of late made their appearance in our literature;[B] but\nthese scattered papers, read by those unacquainted with the original\nwork, often serve to confuse rather than enlighten. For Freud cannot be\nmastered from the reading of a few pamphlets, or even one or two of his\noriginal works. Let me repeat what I have so often said: No one is\nreally qualified to use or to judge Freud\u2019s psychoanalytic method who\nhas not thoroughly mastered his theory of the neuroses\u2014_The\nInterpretation of Dreams_, _Three Contributions to the Sexual Theory_,\n_The Psychopathology of Everyday Life_, and _Wit and its Relation to the\nUnconscious_, and who has not had considerable experience in analysing\nthe dreams and psychopathological actions of himself and others. That\nthere is required also a thorough training in normal and abnormal\npsychology goes without saying.\n_The Interpretation of Dreams_ is the author\u2019s greatest and most\nimportant work; it is here that he develops his psychoanalytic\ntechnique, a thorough knowledge of which is absolutely indispensable for\nevery worker in this field. The difficult task of making a translation\nof this work has, therefore, been undertaken primarily for the purpose\nof assisting those who are actively engaged in treating patients by\nFreud\u2019s psychoanalytic method. Considered apart from its practical aim,\nthe book presents much that is of interest to the psychologist and the\ngeneral reader. For, notwithstanding the fact that dreams have of late\nyears been the subject of investigation at the hands of many competent\nobservers, only few have contributed anything tangible towards their\nsolution; it was Freud who divested the dream of its mystery, and solved\nits riddles. He not only showed us that the dream is full of meaning,\nbut amply demonstrated that it is intimately connected with normal and\nabnormal mental life. It is in the treatment of the abnormal mental\nstates that we must recognise the most important value of dream\ninterpretation. The dream does not only reveal to us the cryptic\nmechanisms of hallucinations, delusions, phobias, obsessions, and other\npsychopathological conditions, but it is also the most potent instrument\nin the removal of these.[C]\nI take this opportunity of expressing my indebtedness to Professor F.

I shall furthermore\nendeavour to explain the processes which give rise to the strangeness\nand obscurity of the dream, and to discover through them the nature of\nthe psychic forces which operate, whether in combination or in\nopposition, to produce the dream. This accomplished, my investigation\nwill terminate, as it will have reached the point where the problem of\nthe dream meets with broader problems, the solution of which must be\nattempted through other material.\nI must presuppose that the reader is acquainted with the work done by\nearlier authors as well as with the present status of the dream problem\nin science, since in the course of this treatise I shall not often have\noccasion to return to them. For, notwithstanding the effort of several\nthousand years, little progress has been made in the scientific\nunderstanding of dreams. This has been so universally acknowledged by\nthe authors that it seems unnecessary to quote individual opinions. One\nwill find in the writings indexed at the end of this book many\nstimulating observations and plenty of interesting material for our\nsubject, but little or nothing that concerns the true nature of the\ndream or that solves definitively any of its enigmas. Still less of\ncourse has been transmitted to the knowledge of the educated laity.\nThe first book in which the dream is treated as an object of psychology\nseems to be that of Aristotle[1] (_Concerning Dreams and their\nInterpretation_). Aristotle asserts that the dream is of demoniacal,\nthough not of divine nature, which indeed contains deep meaning, if it\nbe correctly interpreted. He was also acquainted with some of the\ncharacteristics of dream life, _e.g._, he knew that the dream turns\nslight sensations perceived during sleep into great ones (\u201cone imagines\nthat one walks through fire and feels hot, if this or that part of the\nbody becomes slightly warmed\u201d), which led him to conclude that dreams\nmight easily betray to the physician the first indications of an\nincipient change in the body passing unnoticed during the day. I have\nbeen unable to go more deeply into the Aristotelian treatise, because of\ninsufficient preparation and lack of skilled assistance.\nAs every one knows, the ancients before Aristotle did not consider the\ndream a product of the dreaming mind, but a divine inspiration, and in\nancient times the two antagonistic streams, which one finds throughout\nin the estimates of dream life, were already noticeable. They\ndistinguished between true and valuable dreams, sent to the dreamer to\nwarn him or to foretell the future, and vain, fraudulent, and empty\ndreams, the object of which was to misguide or lead him to\ndestruction.[E] This pre-scientific conception of the dream among the\nancients was certainly in perfect keeping with their general view of\nlife, which was wont to project as reality in the outer world that which\npossessed reality only within the mind. It, moreover, accounted for the\nmain impression made upon the waking life by the memory left from the\ndream in the morning, for in this memory the dream, as compared with the\nrest of the psychic content, seems something strange, coming, as it\nwere, from another world. It would likewise be wrong to suppose that the\ntheory of the supernatural origin of dreams lacks followers in our own\nday; for leaving out of consideration all bigoted and mystical\nauthors\u2014who are perfectly justified in adhering to the remnants of the\nonce extensive realm of the supernatural until they have been swept away\nby scientific explanation\u2014one meets even sagacious men averse to\nanything adventurous, who go so far as to base their religious belief in\nthe existence and co-operation of superhuman forces on the\ninexplicableness of the dream manifestations (Haffner[32]). The validity\nascribed to the dream life by some schools of philosophy, _e.g._ the\nschool of Schelling, is a distinct echo of the undisputed divinity of\ndreams in antiquity, nor is discussion closed on the subject of the\nmantic or prophetic power of dreams. This is due to the fact that the\nattempted psychological explanations are too inadequate to overcome the\naccumulated material, however strongly all those who devote themselves\nto a scientific mode of thought may feel that such assertions should be\nrepudiated.\nTo write a history of our scientific knowledge of dream problems is so\ndifficult because, however valuable some parts of this knowledge may\nhave been, no progress in definite directions has been discernible.\nThere has been no construction of a foundation of assured results upon\nwhich future investigators could continue to build, but every new author\ntakes up the same problems afresh and from the very beginning. Were I to\nfollow the authors in chronological order, and give a review of the\nopinions each has held concerning the problems of the dream, I should be\nprevented from drawing a clear and complete picture of the present state\nof knowledge on the subject. I have therefore preferred to base the\ntreatment upon themes rather than upon the authors, and I shall cite for\neach problem of the dream the material found in the literature for its\nsolution.\nBut as I have not succeeded in mastering the entire literature, which is\nwidely disseminated and interwoven with that on other subjects, I must\nask my readers to rest content provided no fundamental fact or important\nviewpoint be lost in my description.\nUntil recently most authors have been led to treat the subjects of sleep\nand dream in the same connection, and with them they have also regularly\ntreated analogous states of psychopathology, and other dreamlike states\nlike hallucinations, visions, &c. In the more recent works, on the other\nhand, there has been a tendency to keep more closely to the theme, and\nto take as the subject one single question of the dream life. This\nchange, I believe, is an expression of the conviction that enlightenment\nand agreement in such obscure matters can only be brought about by a\nseries of detailed investigations. It is such a detailed investigation\nand one of a special psychological nature, that I would offer here. I\nhave little occasion to study the problem of sleep, as it is essentially\na psychological problem, although the change of functional\ndeterminations for the mental apparatus must be included in the\ncharacter of sleep. The literature of sleep will therefore not be\nconsidered here.\nA scientific interest in the phenomena of dreams as such leads to the\nfollowing in part interdependent inquiries:\n(_a_) _The Relation of the Dream to the Waking State._\u2014The na\u00efve\njudgment of a person on awakening assumes that the dream\u2014if indeed it\ndoes not originate in another world\u2014at any rate has taken the dreamer\ninto another world. The old physiologist, Burdach,[8] to whom we are\nindebted for a careful and discriminating description of the phenomena\nof dreams, expressed this conviction in an often-quoted passage, p. 474:\n\u201cThe waking life never repeats itself with its trials and joys, its\npleasures and pains, but, on the contrary, the dream aims to relieve us\nof these. Even when our whole mind is filled with one subject, when\nprofound sorrow has torn our hearts or when a task has claimed the whole\npower of our mentality, the dream either gives us something entirely\nstrange, or it takes for its combinations only a few elements from\nreality, or it only enters into the strain of our mood and symbolises\nreality.\u201d\nL. Str\u00fcmpell[66] expresses himself to the same effect in his _Nature and\nOrigin of Dreams_ (p. 16), a study which is everywhere justly held in\nhigh respect: \u201cHe who dreams turns his back upon the world of waking\nconsciousness\u201d (p. 17). \u201cIn the dream the memory of the orderly content\nof the waking consciousness and its normal behaviour is as good as\nentirely lost\u201d (p. 19). \u201cThe almost complete isolation of the mind in\nthe dream from the regular normal content and course of the waking\nstate....\u201d\nBut the overwhelming majority of the authors have assumed a contrary\nview of the relation of the dream to waking life. Thus Haffner[32] (p.\n19): \u201cFirst of all the dream is the continuation of the waking state.\nOur dreams always unite themselves with those ideas which have shortly\nbefore been in our consciousness. Careful examination will nearly always\nfind a thread by which the dream has connected itself with the\nexperience of the previous day.\u201d Weygandt[75] (p. 6), flatly contradicts\nthe above cited statement of Burdach: \u201cFor it may often be observed,\napparently in the great majority of dreams, that they lead us directly\nback into everyday life, instead of releasing us from it.\u201d Maury[48] (p.\n56), says in a concise formula: \u201cNous r\u00eavons de ce que nous avons vu,\ndit, d\u00e9sir\u00e9 ou fait.\u201d Jessen,[36] in his _Psychology_, published in 1855\n(p. 530), is somewhat more explicit: \u201cThe content of dreams is more or\nless determined by the individual personality, by age, sex, station in\nlife, education, habits, and by events and experiences of the whole past\nlife.\u201d\nThe ancients had the same idea about the dependence of the dream content\nupon life. I cite Radestock[54] (p. 139): \u201cWhen Xerxes, before his march\nagainst Greece, was dissuaded from this resolution by good counsel, but\nwas again and again incited by dreams to undertake it, one of the old\nrational dream-interpreters of the Persians, Artabanus, told him very\nappropriately that dream pictures mostly contain that of which one has\nbeen thinking while awake.\u201d\nIn the didactic poem of Lucretius, _De Rerum Natura_ (IV, v. 959),\noccurs this passage:\u2014\n\u201cEt quo quisque fere studio devinctus adhaeret,\naut quibus in rebus multum sumus ante morati\natque in ea ratione fuit contenta magis mens,\nin somnis eadem plerumque videmur obire;\ncausidici causas agere et componere leges,\ninduperatores pugnare ac proelia obire,\u201d &c., &c.\nCicero (_De Divinatione_, II) says quite similarly, as does also Maury\nmuch later:\u2014\n\u201cMaximeque reliquiae earum rerum moventur in animis et agitantur, de\nquibus vigilantes aut cogitavimus aut egimus.\u201d\nThe contradiction expressed in these two views as to the relation\nbetween dream life and waking life seems indeed insoluble. It will\ntherefore not be out of place to mention the description of F. W.\nHildebrandt[35] (1875), who believes that the peculiarities of the dream\ncan generally be described only by calling them a \u201cseries of contrasts\nwhich apparently shade off into contradictions\u201d (p. 8). \u201cThe first of\nthese contrasts is formed on the one hand by the strict isolation or\nseclusion of the dream from true and actual life, and on the other hand\nby the continuous encroachment of the one upon the other, and the\nconstant dependency of one upon the other. The dream is something\nabsolutely separated from the reality experienced during the waking\nstate; one may call it an existence hermetically sealed up and separated\nfrom real life by an unsurmountable chasm. It frees us from reality,\nextinguishes normal recollection of reality, and places us in another\nworld and in a totally different life, which at bottom has nothing in\ncommon with reality....\u201d Hildebrandt then asserts that in falling asleep\nour whole being, with all its forms of existence, disappears \u201cas through\nan invisible trap door.\u201d In the dream one is perhaps making a voyage to\nSt. Helena in order to offer the imprisoned Napoleon something exquisite\nin the way of Moselle wine. One is most amicably received by the\nex-emperor, and feels almost sorry when the interesting illusion is\ndestroyed on awakening. But let us now compare the situation of the\ndream with reality. The dreamer has never been a wine merchant, and has\nno desire to become one. He has never made a sea voyage, and St. Helena\nis the last place he would take as destination for such a voyage. The\ndreamer entertains no sympathetic feeling for Napoleon, but on the\ncontrary a strong patriotic hatred. And finally the dreamer was not yet\namong the living when Napoleon died on the island; so that it was beyond\nthe reach of possibility for him to have had any personal relations with\nNapoleon. The dream experience thus appears as something strange,\ninserted between two perfectly harmonising and succeeding periods.\n\u201cNevertheless,\u201d continues Hildebrandt, \u201cthe opposite is seemingly just\nas true and correct. I believe that hand in hand with this seclusion and\nisolation there can still exist the most intimate relation and\nconnection. We may justly say that no matter what the dream offers, it\nfinds its material in reality and in the psychic life arrayed around\nthis reality. However strange the dream may seem, it can never detach\nitself from reality, and its most sublime as well as its most farcical\nstructures must always borrow their elementary material either from what\nwe have seen with our eyes in the outer world, or from what has\npreviously found a place somewhere in our waking thoughts; in other\nwords, it must be taken from what we had already experienced either\nobjectively or subjectively.\u201d\n(_b_) _The Material of the Dream.\u2014Memory in the Dream._\u2014That all the\nmaterial composing the content of the dream in some way originates in\nexperience, that it is reproduced in the dream, or recalled,\u2014this at\nleast may be taken as an indisputable truth. Yet it would be wrong to\nassume that such connection between dream content and reality will be\nreadily disclosed as an obvious product of the instituted comparison. On\nthe contrary, the connection must be carefully sought, and in many cases\nit succeeds in eluding discovery for a long time. The reason for this is\nto be found in a number of peculiarities evinced by the memory in\ndreams, which, though universally known, have hitherto entirely eluded\nexplanation. It will be worth while to investigate exhaustively these\ncharacteristics.\nIt often happens that matter appears in the dream content which one\ncannot recognise later in the waking state as belonging to one\u2019s\nknowledge and experience. One remembers well enough having dreamed about\nthe subject in question, but cannot recall the fact or time of the\nexperience. The dreamer is therefore in the dark as to the source from\nwhich the dream has been drawing, and is even tempted to believe an\nindependently productive activity on the part of the dream, until, often\nlong afterwards, a new episode brings back to recollection a former\nexperience given up as lost, and thus reveals the source of the dream.\nOne is thus forced to admit that something has been known and remembered\nin the dream that has been withdrawn from memory during the waking\nstate.\nDelb\u0153uf[16] narrates from his own experience an especially impressive\nexample of this kind. He saw in his dream the courtyard of his house\ncovered with snow, and found two little lizards half-frozen and buried\nin the snow. Being a lover of animals, he picked them up, warmed them,\nand put them back into a crevice in the wall which was reserved for\nthem. He also gave them some small fern leaves that had been growing on\nthe wall, which he knew they were fond of. In the dream he knew the name\nof the plant: _Asplenium ruta muralis_. The dream then continued,\nreturning after a digression to the lizards, and to his astonishment\nDelb\u0153uf saw two other little animals falling upon what was left of the\nferns. On turning his eyes to the open field he saw a fifth and a sixth\nlizard running into the hole in the wall, and finally the street was\ncovered with a procession of lizards, all wandering in the same\ndirection, &c.\nIn his waking state Delb\u0153uf knew only a few Latin names of plants, and\nnothing of the Asplenium. To his great surprise he became convinced that\na fern of this name really existed and that the correct name was\n_Asplenium ruta muraria_, which the dream had slightly disfigured. An\naccidental coincidence could hardly be considered, but it remained a\nmystery for Delb\u0153uf whence he got his knowledge of the name Asplenium in\nthe dream.\nThe dream occurred in 1862. Sixteen years later, while at the house of\none of his friends, the philosopher noticed a small album containing\ndried plants resembling the albums that are sold as souvenirs to\nvisitors in many parts of Switzerland. A sudden recollection occurred to\nhim; he opened the herbarium, and discovered therein the Asplenium of\nhis dream, and recognised his own handwriting in the accompanying Latin\nname. The connection could now be traced. While on her wedding trip, a\nsister of this friend visited Delb\u0153uf in 1860\u2014two years prior to the\nlizard dream. She had with her at the time this album, which was\nintended for her brother, and Delb\u0153uf took the trouble to write, at the\ndictation of a botanist, under each of the dried plants the Latin name.\nThe favourable accident which made possible the report of this valuable\nexample also permitted Delb\u0153uf to trace another portion of this dream to\nits forgotten source. One day in 1877 he came upon an old volume of an\nillustrated journal, in which he found pictured the whole procession of\nlizards just as he had dreamed it in 1862. The volume bore the date of\n1861, and Delb\u0153uf could recall that he had subscribed to the journal\nfrom its first appearance.\nThat the dream has at its disposal recollections which are inaccessible\nto the waking state is such a remarkable and theoretically important\nfact that I should like to urge more attention to it by reporting\nseveral other \u201cHypermnesic Dreams.\u201d Maury[48] relates that for some time\nthe word Mussidan used to occur to his mind during the day. He knew it\nto be the name of a French city, but nothing else. One night he dreamed\nof a conversation with a certain person who told him that she came from\nMussidan, and, in answer to his question where the city was, she\nreplied: \u201cMussidan is a principal country town in the D\u00e9partement de La\nDordogne.\u201d On waking, Maury put no faith in the information received in\nhis dream; the geographical lexicon, however, showed it to be perfectly\ncorrect. In this case the superior knowledge of the dream is confirmed,\nbut the forgotten source of this knowledge has not been traced.\nJessen[36] tells (p. 55) of a quite similar dream occurrence, from more\nremote times. Among others we may here mention the dream of the elder\nScaliger (Hennings, _l.c._, p. 300), who wrote a poem in praise of\ncelebrated men of Verona, and to whom a man, named Brugnolus, appeared\nin a dream, complaining that he had been neglected. Though Scaliger did\nnot recall ever having heard of him, he wrote some verses in his honour,\nand his son later discovered at Verona that a Brugnolus had formerly\nbeen famous there as a critic.\nMyers is said to have published a whole collection of such hypermnesic\ndreams in the _Proceedings of the Society for Psychical Research_, which\nare unfortunately inaccessible to me. I believe every one who occupies\nhimself with dreams will recognise as a very common phenomenon the fact\nthat the dream gives proof of knowing and recollecting matters unknown\nto the waking person. In my psychoanalytic investigations of nervous\npatients, of which I shall speak later, I am every week more than once\nin position to convince my patients from their dreams that they are well\nacquainted with quotations, obscene expressions, &c., and that they make\nuse of these in their dreams, although they have forgotten them in the\nwaking state. I shall cite here a simple case of dream hypermnesia\nbecause it was easy to trace the source which made the knowledge\naccessible to the dream.\nA patient dreamed in a lengthy connection that he ordered a\n\u201cKontusz\u00f3wka\u201d in a caf\u00e9, and after reporting this inquired what it might\nmean, as he never heard the name before. I was able to answer that\nKontusz\u00f3wka was a Polish liquor which he could not have invented in his\ndream, as the name had long been familiar to me in advertisements. The\npatient would not at first believe me, but some days later, after he had\nrealised his dream of the caf\u00e9, he noticed the name on a signboard at\nthe street corner, which he had been obliged to pass for months at least\ntwice a day.\nI have learned from my own dreams how largely the discovery of the\norigin of some of the dream elements depends on accident. Thus, for\nyears before writing this book, I was haunted by the picture of a very\nsimply formed church tower which I could not recall having seen. I then\nsuddenly recognised it with absolute certainty at a small station\nbetween Salzburg and Reichenhall. This was in the later nineties, and I\nhad travelled over the road for the first time in the year 1886. In\nlater years, when I was already busily engaged in the study of dreams, I\nwas quite annoyed at the frequent recurrence of the dream picture of a\ncertain peculiar locality. I saw it in definite local relation to my\nperson\u2014to my left, a dark space from which many grotesque sandstone\nfigures stood out. A glimmer of recollection, which I did not quite\ncredit, told me it was the entrance to a beer-cellar, but I could\nexplain neither the meaning nor the origin of this dream picture. In\n1907 I came by chance to Padua, which, to my regret, I had been unable\nto visit since 1895. My first visit to this beautiful university city\nwas unsatisfactory; I was unable to see Giotto\u2019s frescoes in the church\nof the Madonna dell\u2019 Arena, and on my way there turned back on being\ninformed that the little church was closed on the day. On my second\nvisit, twelve years later, I thought of compensating myself for this,\nand before everything else I started out for Madonna dell\u2019 Arena. On the\nstreet leading to it, on my left, probably at the place where I had\nturned in 1895, I discovered the locality which I had so often seen in\nthe dream, with its sandstone figures. It was in fact the entrance to a\nrestaurant garden.\nOne of the sources from which the dream draws material for\nreproduction\u2014material which in part is not recalled or employed in\nwaking thought\u2014is to be found in childhood. I shall merely cite some of\nthe authors who have observed and emphasized this.\nHildebrandt[35] (p. 23): \u201cIt has already been expressly admitted that\nthe dream sometimes brings back to the mind with wonderful reproductive\nability remote and even forgotten experiences from the earliest\nperiods.\u201d\nStr\u00fcmpell[66] (p. 40): \u201cThe subject becomes more interesting when we\nremember how the dream sometimes brings forth, as it were, from among\nthe deepest and heaviest strata which later years have piled upon the\nearliest childhood experiences, the pictures of certain places, things,\nand persons, quite uninjured and with their original freshness. This is\nnot limited merely to such impressions as have gained vivid\nconsciousness during their origin or have become impressed with strong\npsychic validity, and then later return in the dream as actual\nreminiscences, causing pleasure to the awakened consciousness. On the\ncontrary, the depths of the dream memory comprise also such pictures of\npersons, things, places, and early experiences as either possessed but\nlittle consciousness and no psychic value at all, or have long ago lost\nboth, and therefore appear totally strange and unknown both in the dream\nand in the waking state, until their former origin is revealed.\u201d\nVolkelt[72] (p. 119): \u201cIt is essentially noteworthy how easily infantile\nand youthful reminiscences enter into the dream. What we have long\nceased to think about, what has long since lost for us all importance,\nis constantly recalled by the dream.\u201d\nThe sway of the dream over the infantile material, which, as is well\nknown, mostly occupies the gaps in the conscious memory, causes the\norigin of interesting hypermnestic dreams, a few of which I shall here\nreport.\nMaury[48] relates (p. 92) that as a child he often went from his native\ncity, Meaux, to the neighbouring Trilport, where his father\nsuperintended the construction of a bridge. On a certain night a dream\ntransported him to Trilport, and he was again playing in the city\nstreets. A man approached him wearing some sort of uniform. Maury asked\nhim his name, and he introduced himself, saying that his name was C\u2014\u2014,\nand that he was a bridge guard. On waking, Maury, who still doubted the\nreality of the reminiscence, asked his old servant, who had been with\nhim in his childhood, whether she remembered a man of this name.\n\u201cCertainly,\u201d was the answer, \u201che used to be watchman on the bridge which\nyour father was building at that time.\u201d\nMaury reports another example demonstrating just as nicely the\nreliability of infantile reminiscences appearing in dreams. Mr. F\u2014\u2014, who\nhad lived as a child in Montbrison, decided to visit his home and old\nfriends of his family after an absence of twenty-five years. The night\nbefore his departure he dreamt that he had reached his destination, and\nthat he met near Montbrison a man, whom he did not know by sight, who\ntold him he was Mr. F., a friend of his father. The dreamer remembered\nthat as a child he had known a gentleman of this name, but on waking he\ncould no longer recall his features. Several days later, having really\narrived at Montbrison, he found the supposedly unknown locality of his\ndream, and there met a man whom he at once recognised as the Mr. F. of\nhis dream. The real person was only older than the one in the dream\npicture.\nI may here relate one of my own dreams in which the remembered\nimpression is replaced by an association. In my dream I saw a person\nwhom I recognised, while dreaming, as the physician of my native town.\nThe features were indistinct and confused with the picture of one of my\ncolleague teachers, whom I still see occasionally. What association\nthere was between the two persons I could not discover on awakening. But\nupon questioning my mother about the physician of my early childhood, I\ndiscovered that he was a one-eyed man. My teacher, whose figure\nconcealed that of the physician in the dream, was also one-eyed. I have\nnot seen the physician for thirty-eight years, and I have not to my\nknowledge thought of him in my waking state, although a scar on my chin\nmight have reminded me of his help.\nAs if to counterbalance the immense r\u00f4le ascribed to the infantile\nimpressions in the dream, many authors assert that the majority of\ndreams show elements from the most recent time. Thus Robert[55] (p. 46)\ndeclares that the normal dream generally occupies itself only with the\nimpressions of the recent days. We learn indeed that the theory of the\ndream advanced by Robert imperatively demands that the old impressions\nshould be pushed back, and the recent ones brought to the front.\nNevertheless the fact claimed by Robert really exists; I can confirm\nthis from my own investigations. Nelson,[50] an American author, thinks\nthat the impressions most frequently found in the dream date from two or\nthree days before, as if the impressions of the day immediately\npreceding the dream were not sufficiently weakened and remote.\nMany authors who are convinced of the intimate connection between the\ndream content and the waking state are impressed by the fact that\nimpressions which have intensely occupied the waking mind appear in the\ndream only after they have been to some extent pushed aside from the\nelaboration of the waking thought. Thus, as a rule, we do not dream of a\ndead beloved person while we are still overwhelmed with sorrow. Still\nMiss Hallam,[33] one of the latest observers, has collected examples\nshowing the very opposite behaviour, and claims for the point the right\nof individual psychology.\nThe third and the most remarkable and incomprehensible peculiarity of\nthe memory in dreams, is shown in the selection of the reproduced\nmaterial, for stress is laid not only on the most significant, but also\non the most indifferent and superficial reminiscences. On this point I\nshall quote those authors who have expressed their surprise in the most\nemphatic manner.\nHildebrandt[35] (p. 11): \u201cFor it is a remarkable fact that dreams do\nnot, as a rule, take their elements from great and deep-rooted events or\nfrom the powerful and urgent interests of the preceding day, but from\nunimportant matters, from the most worthless fragments of recent\nexperience or of a more remote past. The most shocking death in our\nfamily, the impressions of which keep us awake long into the night,\nbecomes obliterated from our memories, until the first moment of\nawakening brings it back to us with depressing force. On the other hand,\nthe wart on the forehead of a passing stranger, of whom we did not think\nfor a second after he was out of sight, plays its part in our dreams.\u201d\nStr\u00fcmpell[66] (p. 39): \u201c... such cases where the analysis of a dream\nbrings to light elements which, although derived from events of the\nprevious day or the day before the last, yet prove to be so unimportant\nand worthless for the waking state that they merge into forgetfulness\nshortly after coming to light. Such occurrences may be statements of\nothers heard accidentally or actions superficially observed, or fleeting\nperceptions of things or persons, or single phrases from books, &c.\u201d\nHavelock Ellis[23] (p. 727): \u201cThe profound emotions of waking life, the\nquestions and problems on which we spread our chief voluntary mental\nenergy, are not those which usually present themselves at once to\ndream-consciousness. It is, so far as the immediate past is concerned,\nmostly the trifling, the incidental, the \u201cforgotten\u201d impressions of\ndaily life which reappear in our dreams. The psychic activities that are\nawake most intensely are those that sleep most profoundly.\u201d\nBinz[4] (p. 45) takes occasion from the above-mentioned characteristics\nof the memory in dreams to express his dissatisfaction with explanations\nof dreams which he himself has approved of: \u201cAnd the normal dream raises\nsimilar questions. Why do we not always dream of memory impressions from\nthe preceding days, instead of going back to the almost forgotten past\nlying far behind us without any perceptible reason? Why in a dream does\nconsciousness so often revive the impression of indifferent memory\npictures while the cerebral cells bearing the most sensitive records of\nexperience remain for the most part inert and numb, unless an acute\nrevival during the waking state has shortly before excited them?\u201d\nWe can readily understand how the strange preference of the dream memory\nfor the indifferent and hence the unnoticed details of daily experience\nmust usually lead us to overlook altogether the dependence of the dream\non the waking state, or at least make it difficult to prove this\ndependence in any individual case. It thus happened that in the\nstatistical treatment of her own and her friend\u2019s dreams, Miss Whiton\nCalkins[12] found 11 per cent. of the entire number that showed no\nrelation to the waking state. Hildebrandt was certainly correct in his\nassertion that all our dream pictures could be genetically explained if\nwe devoted enough time and material to the tracing of their origin. To\nbe sure, he calls this \u201ca most tedious and thankless job.\u201d For it would\nat most lead us to ferret out all kinds of quite worthless psychic\nmaterial from the most remote corners of the memory chamber, and to\nbring to light some very indifferent moments from the remote past which\nwere perhaps buried the next hour after their appearance. I must,\nhowever, express my regret that this discerning author refrained from\nfollowing the road whose beginning looked so unpromising; it would have\nled him directly to the centre of the dream problem.\nThe behaviour of the memory in dreams is surely most significant for\nevery theory of memory in general. It teaches us that \u201cnothing which we\nhave once psychically possessed is ever entirely lost\u201d (Scholz[59]); or\nas Delb\u0153uf puts it, \u201cque toute impression m\u00eame la plus insignifiante,\nlaisse une trace inalt\u00e9rable, ind\u00e9finiment susceptible de repara\u00eetre au\njour,\u201d a conclusion to which we are urged by so many of the other\npathological manifestations of the psychic life. Let us now bear in mind\nthis extraordinary capability of the memory in the dream, in order to\nperceive vividly the contradictions which must be advanced in certain\ndream theories to be mentioned later, when they endeavour to explain the\nabsurdities and incoherence of dreams through a partial forgetting of\nwhat we have known during the day.\nOne might even think of reducing the phenomenon of dreaming to that of\nmemory, and of regarding the dream as the manifestation of an activity\nof reproduction which does not rest even at night, and which is an end\nin itself. Views like those expressed by Pilcz[51] would corroborate\nthis, according to which intimate relations are demonstrable between the\ntime of dreaming and the contents of the dream from the fact that the\nimpressions reproduced by the dream in sound sleep belong to the\nremotest past while those reproduced towards morning are of recent\norigin. But such a conception is rendered improbable from the outset by\nthe manner of the dream\u2019s behaviour towards the material to be\nremembered. Str\u00fcmpell[66] justly calls our attention to the fact that\nrepetitions of experiences do not occur in the dream. To be sure the\ndream makes an effort in that direction, but the next link is wanting,\nor appears in changed form, or it is replaced by something entirely\nnovel. The dream shows only fragments of reproduction; this is so often\nthe rule that it admits of theoretical application. Still there are\nexceptions in which the dream repeats an episode as thoroughly as our\nmemory would in its waking state. Delb\u0153uf tells of one of his university\ncolleagues who in his dream repeated, with all its details, a dangerous\nwagon ride in which he escaped accident as if by miracle. Miss\nCalkins[12] mentions two dreams, the contents of which exactly\nreproduced incidents from the day before, and I shall later take\noccasion to report an example which came to my notice, showing a\nchildish experience which returned unchanged in a dream.[F]\n(_c_) _Dream Stimuli and Dream Sources._\u2014What is meant by dream stimuli\nand dream sources may be explained by referring to the popular saying,\n\u201cDreams come from the stomach.\u201d This notion conceals a theory which\nconceives the dream as a result of a disturbance of sleep. We should not\nhave dreamed if some disturbing element had not arisen in sleep, and the\ndream is the reaction from this disturbance.\nThe discussion of the exciting causes of dreams takes up the most space\nin the descriptions of the authors. That this problem could appear only\nafter the dream had become an object of biological investigation is\nself-evident. The ancients who conceived the dream as a divine\ninspiration had no need of looking for its exciting source; to them the\ndream resulted from the will of the divine or demoniacal powers, and its\ncontent was the product of their knowledge or intention. Science,\nhowever, soon raised the question whether the stimulus to the dream is\nalways the same, or whether it might be manifold, and thus led to the\nquestion whether the causal explanation of the dream belongs to\npsychology or rather to physiology. Most authors seem to assume that the\ncauses of the disturbance of sleep, and hence the sources of the dream,\nmight be of various natures, and that physical as well as mental\nirritations might assume the r\u00f4le of dream inciters. Opinions differ\ngreatly in preferring this or that one of the dream sources, in ranking\nthem, and indeed as to their importance for the origin of dreams.\nWherever the enumeration of dream sources is complete we ultimately find\nfour forms, which are also utilised for the division of dreams:\u2014\nI. External (objective) sensory stimuli.\nII. Internal (subjective) sensory stimuli.\nIII. Internal (organic) physical excitations.\nIV. Purely psychical exciting sources.\nI. _The External Sensory Stimuli._\u2014The younger Str\u00fcmpell, son of the\nphilosopher whose writings on the subject have already more than once\nserved us as a guide in the problem of dreams, has, as is well known,\nreported his observations on a patient who was afflicted with general\nan\u00e6sthesia of the skin and with paralysis of several of the higher\nsensory organs. This man merged into sleep when his few remaining\nsensory paths from the outer world were shut off. When we wish to sleep\nwe are wont to strive for a situation resembling the one in Str\u00fcmpell\u2019s\nexperiment. We close the most important sensory paths, the eyes, and we\nendeavour to keep away from the other senses every stimulus and every\nchange of the stimuli acting upon them. We then fall asleep, although we\nare never perfectly successful in our preparations. We can neither keep\nthe stimuli away from the sensory organs altogether, nor can we fully\nextinguish the irritability of the sensory organs. That we may at any\ntime be awakened by stronger stimuli should prove to us \u201cthat the mind\nhas remained in constant communication with the material world even\nduring sleep.\u201d The sensory stimuli which reach us during sleep may\neasily become the source of dreams.\nThere are a great many stimuli of such nature, ranging from those that\nare unavoidable, being brought on by the sleeping state or at least\noccasionally induced by it, to the accidental waking stimuli which are\nadapted or calculated to put an end to sleep. Thus a strong light may\nforce itself into the eyes, a noise may become perceptible, or some\nodoriferous matter may irritate the mucous membrane of the nose. In the\nspontaneous movements of sleep we may lay bare parts of the body and\nthus expose them to a sensation of cold, or through change of position\nwe may produce sensations of pressure and touch. A fly may bite us, or a\nslight accident at night may simultaneously attack more than one sense.\nObservers have called attention to a whole series of dreams in which the\nstimulus verified on waking, and a part of the dream content\ncorresponded to such a degree that the stimulus could be recognised as\nthe source of the dream.\nI shall here cite a number of such dreams collected by Jessen[36] (p.\n527), traceable to more or less accidental objective sensory stimuli.\n\u201cEvery indistinctly perceived noise gives rise to corresponding dream\npictures; the rolling of thunder takes us into the thick of battle, the\ncrowing of a cock may be transformed into human shrieks of terror, and\nthe creaking of a door may conjure up dreams of burglars breaking into\nthe house. When one of our blankets slips off at night we may dream that\nwe are walking about naked or falling into the water. If we lie\ndiagonally across the bed with our feet extending beyond the edge, we\nmay dream of standing on the brink of a terrifying precipice, or of\nfalling from a steep height. Should our head accidentally get under the\npillow we may then imagine a big rock hanging over us and about to crush\nus under its weight. Accumulation of semen produces voluptuous dreams,\nand local pain the idea of suffering ill treatment, of hostile attacks,\nor of accidental bodily injuries.\u201d\n\u201cMeier (_Versuch einer Erkl\u00e4rung des Nachtwandelns_, Halle, 1758, p.\n33), once dreamed of being assaulted by several persons who threw him\nflat on the ground and drove a stake into the ground between his big and\nsecond toes. While imagining this in his dream he suddenly awoke and\nfelt a blade of straw sticking between his toes. The same author,\naccording to Hemmings (_Von den Traumen und Nachtwandeln_, Weimar, 1784,\np. 258) dreamed on another occasion that he was being hanged when his\nshirt was pinned somewhat tight around his neck. Hauffbauer dreamed in\nhis youth of having fallen from a high wall and found upon waking that\nthe bedstead had come apart, and that he had actually fallen to the\nfloor.... Gregory relates that he once applied a hot-water bottle to his\nfeet, and dreamed of taking a trip to the summit of Mount \u00c6tna, where he\nfound the heat on the ground almost unbearable. After having applied a\nblistering plaster to his head, a second man dreamed of being scalped by\nIndians; a third, whose shirt was damp, dreamed of being dragged through\na stream. An attack of gout caused the patient to believe that he was in\nthe hands of the Inquisition, and suffering pains of torture (Macnish).\u201d\nThe argument based upon the resemblance between stimulus and dream\ncontent is reinforced if through a systematic induction of stimuli we\nsucceed in producing dreams corresponding to the stimuli. According to\nMacnish such experiments have already been made by Giron de\nBuzareingues. \u201cHe left his knee exposed and dreamed of travelling in a\nmail coach at night. He remarked in this connection that travellers\nwould well know how cold the knees become in a coach at night. Another\ntime he left the back of his head uncovered, and dreamed of taking part\nin a religious ceremony in the open air. In the country where he lived\nit was customary to keep the head always covered except on such\noccasions.\u201d\nMaury[48] reports new observations on dreams produced in himself. (A\nnumber of other attempts produced no results.)\n1. He was tickled with a feather on his lips and on the tip of his nose.\nHe dreamed of awful torture, viz. that a mask of pitch was stuck to his\nface and then forcibly torn off, taking the skin with it.\n2. Scissors were sharpened on pincers. He heard bells ringing, then\nsounds of alarm which took him back to the June days of 1848.\n3. Cologne water was put on his nose. He found himself in Cairo in the\nshop of John Maria Farina. This was followed by mad adventures which he\nwas unable to reproduce.\n4. His neck was lightly pinched. He dreamed that a blistering plaster\nwas put on him, and thought of a doctor who treated him in his\nchildhood.\n5. A hot iron was brought near his face. He dreamed that _chauffeurs_[G]\nbroke into the house and forced the occupants to give up their money by\nsticking their feet into burning coals. The Duchess of Abrant\u00e9s, whose\nsecretary he imagined himself in the dream, then entered.\n6. A drop of water was let fall on his forehead. He imagined himself in\nItaly perspiring heavily and drinking white wine of Orvieto.\n7. When a burning candle was repeatedly focussed on him through red\npaper, he dreamed of the weather, of heat, and of a storm at sea which\nhe once experienced in the English Channel.\nD\u2019Hervey,[34] Weygandt,[75] and others have made other attempts to\nproduce dreams experimentally.\nMany have observed the striking skill of the dream in interweaving into\nits structure sudden impressions from the outer world in such a manner\nas to present a gradually prepared and initiated catastrophe\n(Hildebrandt)[35]. \u201cIn former years,\u201d this author relates, \u201cI\noccasionally made use of an alarm clock in order to wake regularly at a\ncertain hour in the morning. It probably happened hundreds of times that\nthe sound of this instrument fitted into an apparently very long and\nconnected dream, as if the entire dream had been especially designed for\nit, as if it found in this sound its appropriate and logically\nindispensable point, its inevitable issue.\u201d\nI shall cite three of these alarm-clock dreams for another purpose.\nVolkelt (p. 68) relates: \u201cA composer once dreamed that he was teaching\nschool, and was just explaining something to his pupils. He had almost\nfinished when he turned to one of the boys with the question: \u2018Did you\nunderstand me?\u2019 The boy cried out like one possessed \u2018Ya.\u2019 Annoyed at\nthis, he reprimanded him for shouting. But now the entire class was\nscreaming \u2018Orya,\u2019 then \u2018Euryo,\u2019 and finally \u2018Feueryo.\u2019 He was now\naroused by an actual alarm of fire in the street.\u201d\nGarnier (_Trait\u00e9 des Facult\u00e9s de l\u2019\u00c2me_, 1865), reported by\nRadestock,[54] relates that Napoleon I., while sleeping in a carriage,\nwas awakened from a dream by an explosion which brought back to him the\ncrossing of the Tagliamento and the bombarding of the Austrians, so that\nhe started up crying, \u201cWe are undermined!\u201d\nThe following dream of Maury[48] has become celebrated. He was sick, and\nremained in bed; his mother sat beside him. He then dreamed of the reign\nof terror at the time of the Revolution. He took part in terrible scenes\nof murder, and finally he himself was summoned before the Tribunal.\nThere he saw Robespierre, Marat, Fouquier-Tinville, and all the sorry\nheroes of that cruel epoch; he had to give an account of himself, and,\nafter all sort of incidents which did not fix themselves in his memory,\nhe was sentenced to death. Accompanied by an enormous crowd, he was led\nto the place of execution. He mounted the scaffold, the executioner tied\nhim to the board, it tipped, and the knife of the guillotine fell. He\nfelt his head severed from the trunk, and awakened in terrible anxiety,\nonly to find that the top piece of the bed had fallen down, and had\nactually struck his cervical vertebra in the same manner as the knife of\na guillotine.\nThis dream gave rise to an interesting discussion introduced by Le\nLorrain[45] and Egger[20] in the _Revue Philosophique_. The question was\nwhether, and how, it was possible for the dreamer to crowd together an\namount of dream content apparently so large in the short space of time\nelapsing between the perception of the waking stimulus and the\nawakening.\nExamples of this nature make it appear that the objective stimuli during\nsleep are the most firmly established of all the dream sources; indeed,\nit is the only stimulus which plays any part in the layman\u2019s knowledge.\nIf we ask an educated person, who is, however, unacquainted with the\nliterature of dreams, how dreams originate, he is sure to answer by\nreferring to a case familiar to him in which a dream has been explained\nafter waking by a recognised objective stimulus. Scientific\ninvestigation cannot, however, stop here, but is incited to further\nresearch by the observation that the stimulus influencing the senses\nduring sleep does not appear in the dream at all in its true form, but\nis replaced by some other presentation which is in some way related to\nit. But the relation existing between the stimulus and the result of the\ndream is, according to Maury,[47] \u201cune affinit\u00e9 quelconque mais qui\nn\u2019est pas unique et exclusive\u201d (p. 72). If we read, _e.g._, three of\nHildebrandt\u2019s \u201cAlarm Clock Dreams,\u201d we will then have to inquire why the\nsame stimulus evoked so many different results, and why just these\nresults and no others.\n(P. 37). \u201cI am taking a walk on a beautiful spring morning. I saunter\nthrough the green fields to a neighbouring village, where I see the\nnatives going to church in great numbers, wearing their holiday attire\nand carrying their hymn-books under their arms. I remember that it is\nSunday, and that the morning service will soon begin. I decide to attend\nit, but as I am somewhat overheated I also decide to cool off in the\ncemetery surrounding the church. While reading the various epitaphs, I\nhear the sexton ascend the tower and see the small village bell in the\ncupola which is about to give signal for the beginning of the devotions.\nFor another short while it hangs motionless, then it begins to swing,\nand suddenly its notes resound so clearly and penetratingly that my\nsleep comes to an end. But the sound of bells comes from the alarm\nclock.\u201d\n\u201cA second combination. It is a clear day, the streets are covered with\ndeep snow. I have promised to take part in a sleigh-ride, but have had\nto wait for some time before it was announced that the sleigh is in\nfront of my house. The preparations for getting into the sleigh are now\nmade. I put on my furs and adjust my muff, and at last I am in my place.\nBut the departure is still delayed, until the reins give the impatient\nhorses the perceptible sign. They start, and the sleigh bells, now\nforcibly shaken, begin their familiar janizary music with a force that\ninstantly tears the gossamer of my dream. Again it is only the shrill\nsound of my alarm clock.\u201d\nStill a third example. \u201cI see the kitchen-maid walk along the corridor\nto the dining-room with several dozen plates piled up. The porcelain\ncolumn in her arms seems to me to be in danger of losing its\nequilibrium. \u2018Take care,\u2019 I exclaim, \u2018you will drop the whole pile.\u2019 The\nusual retort is naturally not wanting\u2014that she is used to such things.\nMeanwhile I continue to follow her with my worried glance, and behold!\nat the door-step the fragile dishes fall, tumble, and roll across the\nfloor in hundreds of pieces. But I soon notice that the noise continuing\nendlessly is not really a rattling but a true ringing, and with this\nringing the dreamer now becomes aware that the alarm clock has done its\nduty.\u201d\nThe question why the dreaming mind misjudges the nature of the objective\nsensory stimulus has been answered by Str\u00fcmpell,[66] and almost\nidentically by Wundt,[76] to the effect that the reaction of the mind to\nthe attacking stimuli in sleep is determined by the formation of\nillusions. A sensory impression is recognised by us and correctly\ninterpreted, i.e. it is classed with the memory group to which it\nbelongs according to all previous experience, if the impression is\nstrong, clear, and long enough, and if we have the necessary time at our\ndisposal for this reflection. If these conditions are not fulfilled, we\nmistake the objects which give rise to the impression, and on its basis\nwe form an illusion. \u201cIf one takes a walk in an open field and perceives\nindistinctly a distant object, it may happen that he will at first take\nit for a horse.\u201d On closer inspection the image of a cow resting may\nobtrude itself, and the presentation may finally resolve itself with\ncertainty into a group of people sitting. The impressions which the mind\nreceives during sleep through outer stimuli are of a similar indistinct\nnature; they give rise to illusions because the impression evokes a\ngreater or lesser number of memory pictures through which the impression\nreceives its psychic value. In which of the many spheres of memory to be\ntaken into consideration the corresponding pictures are aroused, and\nwhich of the possible association connections thereby come into force,\nthis, even according to Str\u00fcmpell, remains indeterminable, and is left,\nas it were, to the caprice of the psychic life.\nWe may here take our choice. We may admit that the laws of the dream\nformation cannot really be traced any further, and therefore refrain\nfrom asking whether or not the interpretation of the illusion evoked by\nthe sensory impression depends upon still other conditions; or we may\nsuppose that the objective sensory stimulus encroaching upon sleep plays\nonly a modest part as a dream source, and that other factors determine\nthe choice of the memory picture to be evoked. Indeed, on carefully\nexamining Maury\u2019s experimentally produced dreams, which I have purposely\nreported in detail, one is apt to think that the experiment really\nexplains the origin of only one of the dream elements, and that the rest\nof the dream content appears in fact too independent, too much\ndetermined in detail, to be explained by the one demand, viz. that it\nmust agree with the element experimentally introduced. Indeed one even\nbegins to doubt the illusion theory, and the power of the objective\nimpression to form the dream, when one learns that this impression at\ntimes experiences the most peculiar and far-fetched interpretations\nduring the sleeping state. Thus B. M. Simon[63] tells of a dream in\nwhich he saw persons of gigantic stature[H] seated at a table, and heard\ndistinctly the awful rattling produced by the impact of their jaws while\nchewing. On waking he heard the clacking of the hoofs of a horse\ngalloping past his window. If the noise of the horse\u2019s hoofs had\nrecalled ideas from the memory sphere of \u201cGulliver\u2019s Travels,\u201d the\nsojourn with the giants of Brobdingnag and the virtuous\nhorse-creatures\u2014as I should perhaps interpret it without any assistance\non the author\u2019s part\u2014should not the choice of a memory sphere so\nuncommon for the stimulus have some further illumination from other\nmotives?\nII. _Internal (Subjective) Sensory Stimuli._\u2014Notwithstanding all\nobjections to the contrary, we must admit that the r\u00f4le of the objective\nsensory stimuli as a producer of dreams has been indisputably\nestablished, and if these stimuli seem perhaps insufficient in their\nnature and frequency to explain all dream pictures, we are then directed\nto look for other dream sources acting in an analogous manner. I do not\nknow where the idea originated that along with the outer sensory stimuli\nthe inner (subjective) stimuli should also be considered, but as a\nmatter of fact this is done more or less fully in all the more recent\ndescriptions of the etiology of dreams. \u201cAn important part is played in\ndream illusions,\u201d says Wundt[36] (p. 363), \u201cby those subjective\nsensations of seeing and hearing which are familiar to us in the waking\nstate as a luminous chaos in the dark field of vision, ringing, buzzing,\n&c., of the ears, and especially irritation of the retina. This explains\nthe remarkable tendency of the dream to delude the eyes with numbers of\nsimilar or identical objects. Thus we see spread before our eyes\nnumberless birds, butterflies, fishes, coloured beads, flowers, &c. Here\nthe luminous dust in the dark field of vision has taken on phantastic\nfigures, and the many luminous points of which it consists are embodied\nby the dream in as many single pictures, which are looked upon as moving\nobjects owing to the mobility of the luminous chaos. This is also the\nroot of the great fondness of the dream for the most complex animal\nfigures, the multiplicity of forms readily following the form of the\nsubjective light pictures.\u201d\nThe subjective sensory stimuli as a source of the dream have the obvious\nadvantage that unlike the objective stimuli they are independent of\nexternal accidents. They are, so to speak, at the disposal of the\nexplanation as often as it needs them. They are, however, in so far\ninferior to the objective sensory stimuli that the r\u00f4le of dream\ninciter, which observation and experiment have proven for the latter,\ncan be verified in their case only with difficulty or not at all. The\nmain proof for the dream-inciting power of subjective sensory\nexcitements is offered by the so-called hypnogogic hallucinations, which\nhave been described by John M\u00fcller as \u201cphantastic visual\nmanifestations.\u201d They are those very vivid and changeable pictures which\noccur regularly in many people during the period of falling asleep, and\nwhich may remain for awhile even after the eyes have been opened.\nMaury,[48] who was considerably troubled by them, subjected them to a\nthorough study, and maintained that they are related to or rather\nidentical with dream pictures\u2014this has already been asserted by John\nM\u00fcller. Maury states that a certain psychic passivity is necessary for\ntheir origin; it requires a relaxation of the tension of attention (p.\n59). But in any ordinary disposition a hypnogogic hallucination may be\nproduced by merging for a second into such lethargy, after which one\nperhaps awakens until this oft-repeated process terminates in sleep.\nAccording to Maury, if one awakens shortly thereafter, it is often\npossible to demonstrate the same pictures in the dream which one has\nperceived as hypnogogic hallucinations before falling asleep (p. 134).\nThus it once happened to Maury with a group of pictures of grotesque\nfigures, with distorted features and strange headdresses, which obtruded\nthemselves upon him with incredible importunity during the period of\nfalling asleep, and which he recalled having dreamed upon awakening. On\nanother occasion, while suffering from hunger, because he kept himself\non a rather strict diet, he saw hypnogogically a plate and a hand armed\nwith a fork taking some food from the plate. In his dream he found\nhimself at a table abundantly supplied with food, and heard the rattle\nmade by the diners with their forks. On still another occasion, after\nfalling asleep with irritated and painful eyes, he had the hypnogogic\nhallucination of seeing microscopically small characters which he was\nforced to decipher one by one with great exertion; having been awakened\nfrom his sleep an hour later, he recalled a dream in which there was an\nopen book with very small letters, which he was obliged to read through\nwith laborious effort.\nJust as in the case of these pictures, auditory hallucinations of words,\nnames, &c., may also appear hypnogogically, and then repeat themselves\nin the dream, like an overture announcing the principal motive of the\nopera which is to follow.\nA more recent observer of hypnogogic hallucinations, G. Trumbull\nLadd,[40] takes the same path pursued by John M\u00fcller and Maury. By dint\nof practice he succeeded in acquiring the faculty of suddenly arousing\nhimself, without opening his eyes, two to five minutes after having\ngradually fallen asleep, which gave him opportunity to compare the\nsensations of the retina just vanishing with the dream pictures\nremaining in his memory. He assures us that an intimate relation between\nthe two can always be recognised, in the sense that the luminous dots\nand lines of the spontaneous light of the retina produced, so to speak,\nthe sketched outline or scheme for the psychically perceived dream\nfigures. A dream, _e.g._, in which he saw in front of him clearly\nprinted lines which he read and studied, corresponded to an arrangement\nof the luminous dots and lines in the retina in parallel lines, or, to\nexpress it in his own words: \u201cThe clearly printed page, which he was\nreading in the dream, resolved itself into an object which appeared to\nhis waking perception like part of an actual printed sheet looked at\nthrough a little hole in a piece of paper, from too great a distance to\nbe made out distinctly.\u201d Without in any way under-estimating the central\npart of the phenomenon, Ladd believes that hardly any visual dream\noccurs in our minds that is not based on material furnished by this\ninner condition of stimulation in the retina. This is particularly true\nof dreams occurring shortly after falling asleep in a dark room, while\ndreams occurring in the morning near the period of awakening receive\ntheir stimulation from the objective light penetrating the eye from the\nlightened room. The shifting and endlessly variable character of the\nspontaneous luminous excitation of the retina corresponds exactly to the\nfitful succession of pictures presented to us in our dreams. If we\nattach any importance to Ladd\u2019s observations, we cannot underrate the\nproductiveness of this subjective source of excitation for the dream;\nfor visual pictures apparently form the principal constituent of our\ndreams. The share furnished from the spheres of the other senses, beside\nthe sense of hearing, is more insignificant and inconstant.\nIII. _Internal (Organic) Physical Excitation._\u2014If we are disposed to\nseek dream sources not outside, but inside, the organism, we must\nremember that almost all our internal organs, which in their healthy\nstate hardly remind us of their existence, may, in states of\nexcitation\u2014as we call them\u2014or in disease, become for us a source of the\nmost painful sensations, which must be put on an equality with the\nexternal excitants of the pain and sensory stimuli. It is on the\nstrength of very old experience that, _e.g._, Str\u00fcmpell[66] declares\nthat \u201cduring sleep the mind becomes far more deeply and broadly\nconscious of its connection with the body than in the waking state, and\nit is compelled to receive and be influenced by stimulating impressions\noriginating in parts and changes of the body of which it is unconscious\nin the waking state.\u201d Even Aristotle[1] declares it quite possible that\nthe dream should draw our attention to incipient morbid conditions which\nwe have not noticed at all in the waking state owing to the exaggeration\ngiven by the dream to the impressions; and some medical authors, who\nwere certainly far from believing in any prophetic power of the dream,\nhave admitted this significance of the dream at least for the\nforetelling of disease. (Compare M. Simon, p. 31, and many older\nauthors.)\nEven in our times there seems to be no lack of authenticated examples of\nsuch diagnostic performances on the part of the dream. Thus Tissi\u00e9[68]\ncites from Artigues (_Essai sur la Valeur s\u00e9m\u00e9iologique des R\u00e9ves_), the\nhistory of a woman of forty-three years, who, during several years of\napparently perfect health, was troubled with anxiety dreams, and in whom\nmedical examination later disclosed an incipient affection of the heart\nto which she soon succumbed.\nSerious disturbances of the internal organs apparently act as inciters\nof dreams in a considerable number of persons. Attention is quite\ngenerally called to the frequency of anxiety dreams in the diseases of\nthe heart and lungs; indeed this relation of the dream life is placed so\nconspicuously in the foreground by many authors that I shall here\ncontent myself with a mere reference to the literature. (Radestock,[54]\nSpitta,[64] Maury, M. Simon, Tissi\u00e9.) Tissi\u00e9 even assumes that the\ndiseased organs impress upon the dream content their characteristic\nfeatures. The dreams of persons suffering from diseases of the heart are\ngenerally very brief and terminate in a terrified awakening; the\nsituation of death under terrible circumstances almost always plays a\npart in their content. Those suffering from diseases of the lungs dream\nof suffocation, of being crowded, and of flight, and a great many of\nthem are subject to the well-known nightmare, which, by the way, Boerner\nhas succeeded in producing experimentally by lying on the face and\nclosing up the openings of the respiratory organs. In digestive\ndisturbances the dream contains ideas from the sphere of enjoyment and\ndisgust. Finally, the influence of sexual excitement on the dream\ncontent is perceptible enough in every one\u2019s experience, and lends the\nstrongest support to the entire theory of the dream excitation through\norganic sensation.\nMoreover, as we go through the literature of the dream, it becomes quite\nobvious that some of the authors (Maury,[48] Weygandt[75]) have been led\nto the study of dream problems by the influence of their own\npathological state on the content of their dreams.\nThe addition to dream sources from these undoubtedly established facts\nis, however, not as important as one might be led to suppose; for the\ndream is a phenomenon which occurs in healthy persons\u2014perhaps in all\npersons, and every night\u2014and a pathological state of the organs is\napparently not one of its indispensable conditions. For us, however, the\nquestion is not whence particular dreams originate, but what may be the\nexciting source for the ordinary dreams of normal persons.\nBut we need go only a step further to find a dream source which is more\nprolific than any of those mentioned above, which indeed promises to be\ninexhaustible in every case. If it is established that the bodily organs\nbecome in sickness an exciting source of dreams, and if we admit that\nthe mind, diverted during sleep from the outer world, can devote more\nattention to the interior of the body, we may readily assume that the\norgans need not necessarily become diseased in order to permit stimuli,\nwhich in some way or other grow into dream pictures, to reach the\nsleeping mind. What in the waking state we broadly perceive as general\nsensation, distinguishable by its quality alone, to which, in the\nopinion of the physicians, all the organic systems contribute their\nshares\u2014this general sensation at night attaining powerful efficiency and\nbecoming active with its individual components\u2014would naturally furnish\nthe most powerful as well as the most common source for the production\nof the dream presentations. It still remains, however, to examine\naccording to what rule the organic sensations become transformed into\ndream presentations.\nThe theory of the origin of dreams just stated has been the favourite\nwith all medical authors. The obscurity which conceals the essence of\nour being\u2014the \u201c_moi splanchnique_,\u201d as Tissi\u00e9 terms it\u2014from our\nknowledge and the obscurity of the origin of the dream correspond too\nwell not to be brought into relation with each other. The train of\nthought which makes organic sensation the inciter of the dream has\nbesides another attraction for the physician, inasmuch as it favours the\netiological union of the dream and mental diseases, which show so many\nagreements in their manifestations, for alterations in the organic\nsensations and excitations emanating from the inner organs are both of\nwide significance in the origin of the psychoses. It is therefore not\nsurprising that the theory of bodily sensation can be traced to more\nthan one originator who has propounded it independently.\nA number of authors have been influenced by the train of ideas developed\nby the philosopher Schopenhauer in 1851. Our conception of the universe\noriginates through the fact that our intellect recasts the impressions\ncoming to it from without in the moulds of time, space, and causality.\nThe sensations from the interior of the organism, proceeding from the\nsympathetic nervous system, exert in the day-time an influence on our\nmood for the most part unconscious. At night, however, when the\noverwhelming influence of the day\u2019s impressions is no longer felt, the\nimpressions pressing upward from the interior are able to gain\nattention\u2014just as in the night we hear the rippling of the spring that\nwas rendered inaudible by the noise of the day. In what other way, then,\ncould the intellect react upon these stimuli than by performing its\ncharacteristic function? It will transform the stimuli into figures,\nfilling space and time, which move at the beginning of causality; and\nthus the dream originates. Scherner,[58] and after him Volkelt,[72]\nattempted to penetrate into closer relations between physical sensations\nand dream pictures; but we shall reserve the discussion of these\nattempts for the chapter on the theory of the dream.\nIn a study particularly logical in its development, the psychiatrist\nKrauss[39] found the origin of the dream as well as of deliria and\ndelusions in the same element, viz. the organically determined\nsensation. According to this author there is hardly a place in the\norganism which might not become the starting point of a dream or of a\ndelusion. Now organically determined sensations \u201cmay be divided into two\nclasses: (1) those of the total feeling (general sensations), (2)\nspecific sensations which are inherent in the principal systems of the\nvegetative organism, which may be divided into five groups: (_a_) the\nmuscular, (_b_) the pneumatic, (_c_) the gastric, (_d_) the sexual,\n(_e_) the peripheral sensations (p. 33 of the second article).\u201d\nThe origin of the dream picture on the basis of the physical sensations\nis conceived by Krauss as follows: The awakened sensation evokes a\npresentation related to it in accordance with some law of association,\nand combines with this, thus forming an organic structure, towards\nwhich, however, consciousness does not maintain its normal attitude. For\nit does not bestow any attention on the sensation itself, but concerns\nitself entirely with the accompanying presentation; this is likewise the\nreason why the state of affairs in question should have been so long\nmisunderstood (p. 11, &c.). Krauss finds for this process the specific\nterm of \u201ctransubstantiation of the feeling into dream pictures\u201d (p. 24).\nThat the organic bodily sensations exert some influence on the formation\nof the dream is nowadays almost universally acknowledged, but the\nquestion as to the law underlying the relation between the two is\nanswered in various ways and often in obscure terms. On the basis of the\ntheory of bodily excitation the special task of dream interpretation is\nto trace back the content of a dream to the causative organic stimulus,\nand if we do not recognise the rules of interpretation advanced by\nScherner,[58] we frequently find ourselves confronted with the awkward\nfact that the organic exciting source reveals itself in the content of\nthe dream only.\nA certain agreement, however, is manifested in the interpretation of the\nvarious forms of dreams which have been designated as \u201ctypical\u201d because\nthey recur in so many persons with almost the same contents. Among these\nare the well-known dreams of falling from heights, of the falling out of\nteeth, of flying, and of embarrassment because of being naked or barely\nclad. This last dream is said to be caused simply by the perception felt\nin sleep that one has thrown off the bedcover and is exposed. The dream\nof the falling out of teeth is explained by \u201cdental irritation,\u201d which\ndoes not, however, of necessity imply a morbid state of excitation in\nthe teeth. According to Str\u00fcmpell,[66] the flying dream is the adequate\npicture used by the mind to interpret the sum of excitation emanating\nfrom the rising and sinking of the pulmonary lobes after the cutaneous\nsensation of the thorax has been reduced to insensibility. It is this\nlatter circumstance that causes a sensation related to the conception of\nflying. Falling from a height in a dream is said to have its cause in\nthe fact that when unconsciousness of the sensation of cutaneous\npressure has set in, either an arm falls away from the body or a flexed\nknee is suddenly stretched out, causing the feeling of cutaneous\npressure to return to consciousness, and the transition to consciousness\nembodies itself psychically as a dream of falling. (Str\u00fcmpell, p. 118).\nThe weakness of these plausible attempts at explanation evidently lies\nin the fact that without any further elucidation they allow this or that\ngroup of organic sensations to disappear from psychic perception or to\nobtrude themselves upon it until the constellation favourable for the\nexplanation has been established. I shall, however, later have occasion\nto recur to typical dreams and to their origin.\nFrom comparison of a series of similar dreams, M. Simon[63] endeavoured\nto formulate certain rules for the influence of the organic sensations\non the determination of the resulting dream. He says (p. 34): \u201cIf any\norganic apparatus, which during sleep normally participates in the\nexpression of an affect, for any reason merges into the state of\nexcitation to which it is usually aroused by that affect, the dream thus\nproduced will contain presentations which fit the affect.\u201d\nAnother rule reads as follows (p. 35): \u201cIf an organic apparatus is in a\nstate of activity, excitation, or disturbance during sleep, the dream\nwill bring ideas which are related to the exercise of the organic\nfunction which is performed by that apparatus.\u201d\nMourly Vold[73] has undertaken to prove experimentally the influence\nassumed by the theory of bodily sensation for a single territory. He has\nmade experiments in altering the positions of the sleeper\u2019s limbs, and\nhas compared the resulting dream with his alterations. As a result he\nreports the following theories:\u2014\n1. The position of a limb in a dream corresponds approximately to that\nof reality, _i.e._ we dream of a static condition of the limb which\ncorresponds to the real condition.\n2. When one dreams of a moving limb it always happens that one of the\npositions occurring in the execution of this movement corresponds to the\nreal position.\n3. The position of one\u2019s own limb may be attributed in the dream to\nanother person.\n4. One may dream further that the movement in question is impeded.\n5. The limb in any particular position may appear in the dream as an\nanimal or monster, in which case a certain analogy between the two is\nestablished.\n6. The position of a limb may incite in the dream ideas which bear some\nrelation or other to this limb. Thus, _e.g._, if we are employed with\nthe fingers we dream of numerals.\nSuch results would lead me to conclude that even the theory of bodily\nsensation cannot fully extinguish the apparent freedom in the\ndetermination of the dream picture to be awakened.[I]\nIV. _Psychic Exciting Sources._\u2014In treating the relations of the dream\nto the waking life and the origin of the dream material, we learned that\nthe earliest as well as the latest investigators agreed that men dream\nof what they are doing in the day-time, and of what they are interested\nin during the waking state. This interest continuing from waking life\ninto sleep, besides being a psychic tie joining the dream to life, also\nfurnishes us a dream source not to be under-estimated, which, taken with\nthose stimuli which become interesting and active during sleep, suffices\nto explain the origin of all dream pictures. But we have also heard the\nopposite of the above assertion, viz. that the dream takes the sleeper\naway from the interests of the day, and that in most cases we do not\ndream of things that have occupied our attention during the day until\nafter they have lost for the waking life the stimulus of actuality.\nHence in the analysis of the dream life we are reminded at every step\nthat it is inadmissible to frame general rules without making provision\nfor qualifications expressed by such terms as \u201cfrequently,\u201d \u201cas a rule,\u201d\n\u201cin most cases,\u201d and without preparing for the validity of the\nexceptions.\nIf the conscious interest, together with the inner and outer sleep\nstimuli, sufficed to cover the etiology of the dreams, we ought to be in\na position to give a satisfactory account of the origin of all the\nelements of a dream; the riddle of the dream sources would thus be\nsolved, leaving only the task of separating the part played by the\npsychic and the somatic dream stimuli in individual dreams. But as a\nmatter of fact no such complete solution of a dream has ever been\naccomplished in any case, and, what is more, every one attempting such\nsolution has found that in most cases there have remained a great many\ncomponents of the dream, the source of which he was unable to explain.\nThe daily interest as a psychic source of dreams is evidently not\nfar-reaching enough to justify the confident assertions to the effect\nthat we all continue our waking affairs in the dream.\nOther psychic sources of dreams are unknown. Hence, with the exception\nperhaps of the explanation of dreams given by Scherner,[58] which will\nbe referred to later, all explanations found in the literature show a\nlarge gap when we come to the derivation of the material for the\npresentation pictures, which is most characteristic for the dream. In\nthis dilemma the majority of authors have developed a tendency to\ndepreciate as much as possible the psychic factor in the excitations of\ndreams which is so difficult to approach. To be sure, they distinguish\nas a main division of dreams the nerve-exciting and the association\ndreams, and assert that the latter has its source exclusively in\nreproduction (Wundt,[76] p. 365), but they cannot yet dismiss the doubt\nwhether \u201cthey do not appear without being impelled by the psychical\nstimulus\u201d (Volkelt,[72] p. 127). The characteristic quality of the pure\nassociation dream is also found wanting. To quote Volkelt (p. 118): \u201cIn\nthe association dreams proper we can no longer speak of such a firm\nnucleus. Here the loose grouping penetrates also into the centre of the\ndream. The ideation which is already set free from reason and intellect\nis here no longer held together by the more important psychical and\nmental stimuli, but is left to its own aimless shifting and complete\nconfusion.\u201d Wundt, too, attempts to depreciate the psychic factor in the\nstimulation of dreams by declaring that the \u201cphantasms of the dream\ncertainly are unjustly regarded as pure hallucinations, and that\nprobably most dream presentations are really illusions, inasmuch as they\nemanate from slight sensory impressions which are never extinguished\nduring sleep\u201d (p. 338, &c.). Weygandt[75] agrees with this view, but\ngeneralises it. He asserts that \u201cthe first source of all dream\npresentations is a sensory stimulus to which reproductive associations\nare then joined\u201d (p. 17). Tissi\u00e9[68] goes still further in repressing\nthe psychic exciting sources (p. 183): \u201cLes r\u00eaves d\u2019origine absolument\npsychique n\u2019existent pas\u201d; and elsewhere (p. 6), \u201cLes pens\u00e9es de nos\nr\u00eaves nous viennent de dehors....\u201d\nThose authors who, like the influential philosopher Wundt, adopt a\nmiddle course do not fail to remark that in most dreams there is a\nco-operation of the somatic stimuli with the psychic instigators of the\ndream, the latter being either unknown or recognised as day interests.\nWe shall learn later that the riddle of the dream formation can be\nsolved by the disclosure of an unsuspected psychic source of excitement.\nFor the present we shall not be surprised at the over-estimation of\nthose stimuli for the formation of the dream which do not originate from\npsychic life. It is not merely because they alone can easily be found\nand even confirmed by experiment, but the somatic conception of the\norigin of dreams thoroughly corresponds to the mode of thinking in vogue\nnowadays in psychiatry. Indeed, the mastery of the brain over the\norganism is particularly emphasized; but everything that might prove an\nindependence of the psychic life from the demonstrable organic changes,\nor a spontaneity in its manifestations, is alarming to the psychiatrist\nnowadays, as if an acknowledgment of the same were bound to bring back\nthe times of natural philosophy and the metaphysical conception of the\npsychic essence. The distrust of the psychiatrist has placed the psyche\nunder a guardian, so to speak, and now demands that none of its feelings\nshall divulge any of its own faculties; but this attitude shows slight\nconfidence in the stability of the causal concatenation which extends\nbetween the material and the psychic. Even where on investigation the\npsychic can be recognised as the primary course of a phenomenon, a more\nprofound penetration will some day succeed in finding a continuation of\nthe path to the organic determination of the psychic. But where the\npsychic must be taken as the terminus for our present knowledge, it\nshould not be denied on that account.\n(_d_) _Why the Dream is Forgotten after Awakening._\u2014That the dream\n\u201cfades away\u201d in the morning is proverbial. To be sure, it is capable of\nrecollection. For we know the dream only by recalling it after\nawakening; but very often we believe that we remember it only\nincompletely, and that during the night there was more of it; we can\nobserve how the memory of a dream which has been still vivid in the\nmorning vanishes in the course of the day, leaving only a few small\nfragments; we often know that we have been dreaming, but we do not know\nwhat; and we are so well used to the fact that the dream is liable to be\nforgotten that we do not reject as absurd the possibility that one may\nhave been dreaming even when one knows nothing in the morning of either\nthe contents or the fact of dreaming. On the other hand, it happens that\ndreams manifest an extraordinary retentiveness in the memory. I have had\noccasion to analyse with my patients dreams which had occurred to them\ntwenty-five years or more previously, and I can remember a dream of my\nown which is separated from the present day by at least thirty-seven\nyears, and yet has lost nothing of its freshness in my memory. All this\nis very remarkable, and for the present incomprehensible.\nThe forgetting of dreams is treated in the most detailed manner by\nStr\u00fcmpell.[66] This forgetting is evidently a complex phenomenon; for\nStr\u00fcmpell does not explain it by a single reason, but by a considerable\nnumber of reasons.\nIn the first place, all those factors which produce forgetfulness in the\nwaking state are also determinant for the forgetting of dreams. When\nawake we are wont soon to forget a large number of sensations and\nperceptions because they are too feeble, and because they are connected\nwith a slight amount of emotional feeling. This is also the case with\nmany dream pictures; they are forgotten because they are too weak, while\nstronger pictures in proximity will be remembered. Moreover, the factor\nof intensity in itself is not the only determinant for the preservation\nof the dream pictures; Str\u00fcmpell, as well as other authors (Calkins),\nadmits that dream pictures are often rapidly forgotten, although they\nare known to have been vivid, whereas among those that are retained in\nmemory there are many that are very shadowy and hazy. Besides, in the\nwaking state one is wont to forget easily what happened only once, and\nto note more easily things of repeated occurrence. But most dream\npictures are single experiences,[J] and this peculiarity equally\ncontributes towards the forgetting of all dreams. Of greater\nsignificance is a third motive for forgetting. In order that feelings,\npresentations, thoughts and the like, should attain a certain degree of\nmemory, it is important that they should not remain isolated, but that\nthey should enter into connections and associations of a suitable kind.\nIf the words of a short verse are taken and mixed together, it will be\nvery difficult to remember them. \u201cWhen well arranged in suitable\nsequence one word will help another, and the whole remains as sense\neasily and firmly in the memory for a long time. Contradictions we\nusually retain with just as much difficulty and rarity as things\nconfused and disarranged.\u201d Now dreams in most cases lack sense and\norder. Dream compositions are by their very nature incapable of being\nremembered, and they are forgotten because they usually crumble together\nthe very next moment. To be sure, these conclusions are not in full\naccord with the observation of Radestock[54] (p. 168), that we retain\nbest just those dreams which are most peculiar.\nAccording to Str\u00fcmpell, there are still other factors effective in the\nforgetting of dreams which are derived from the relation of the dream to\nthe waking state. The forgetfulness of the waking consciousness for\ndreams is evidently only the counterpart of the fact already mentioned,\nthat the dream (almost) never takes over successive memories from the\nwaking state, but only certain details of these memories which it tears\naway from the habitual psychic connections in which they are recalled\nwhile we are awake. The dream composition, therefore, has no place in\nthe company of psychic successions which fill the mind. It lacks all the\naids of memory. \u201cIn this manner the dream structure rises, as it were,\nfrom the soil of our psychic life, and floats in psychic space like a\ncloud in the sky, which the next breath of air soon dispels\u201d (p. 87).\nThis is also aided by the fact that, upon awakening, the attention is\nimmediately seized by the inrushing sensory world, and only very few\ndream pictures can withstand this power. They fade away before the\nimpressions of the new day like the glow of the stars before the\nsunlight.\nAs a last factor favouring the forgetting of dreams, we may mention the\nfact that most people generally take little interest in their dreams.\nOne who investigates dreams for a time, and takes a special interest in\nthem, usually dreams more during that time than at any other; that is,\nhe remembers his dreams more easily and more frequently.\nTwo other reasons for the forgetting of dreams added by Bonatelli (given\nby Benini[3]) to those of Str\u00fcmpell have already been included in the\nlatter; namely, (1) that the change of the general feeling between the\nsleeping and waking states is unfavourable to the mutual reproductions,\nand (2) that the different arrangement of the presentation material in\nthe dream makes the dream untranslatable, so to speak, for the waking\nconsciousness.\nIt is the more remarkable, as Str\u00fcmpell observes, that, in spite of all\nthese reasons for forgetting the dream, so many dreams are retained in\nmemory. The continued efforts of the authors to formulate laws for the\nremembering of dreams amounts to an admission that here too there is\nsomething puzzling and unsolved. Certain peculiarities relating to the\nmemory of dreams have been particularly noticed of late, _e.g._, that a\ndream which is considered forgotten in the morning may be recalled in\nthe course of the day through a perception which accidentally touches\nthe forgotten content of the dream (Radestock,[54] Tissi\u00e9[68]). The\nentire memory of the dream is open to an objection calculated to\ndepreciate its value very markedly in critical eyes. One may doubt\nwhether our memory, which omits so much from the dream, does not falsify\nwhat it retained.\nSuch doubts relating to the exactness of the reproduction of the dream\nare expressed by Str\u00fcmpell when he says: \u201cIt therefore easily happens\nthat the active consciousness involuntarily inserts much in recollection\nof the dream; one imagines one has dreamt all sorts of things which the\nactual dream did not contain.\u201d\nJessen[36] (p. 547) expresses himself very decidedly: \u201cMoreover we must\nnot lose sight of the fact, hitherto little heeded, that in the\ninvestigation and interpretation of orderly and logical dreams we almost\nalways play with the truth when we recall a dream to memory.\nUnconsciously and unwittingly we fill up the gaps and supplement the\ndream pictures. Rarely, and perhaps never, has a connected dream been as\nconnected as it appears to us in memory. Even the most truth-loving\nperson can hardly relate a dream without exaggerating and embellishing\nit. The tendency of the human mind to conceive everything in connection\nis so great that it unwittingly supplies the deficiencies of connection\nif the dream is recalled somewhat disconnectedly.\u201d\nThe observations of V. Eggers,[20] though surely independently\nconceived, sound almost like a translation of Jessen\u2019s words: \u201c...\nL\u2019observation des r\u00eaves a ses difficult\u00e9s sp\u00e9ciales et le seul moyen\nd\u2019\u00e9viter toute erreur en pareille mati\u00e8re est de confier au papier sans\nle moindre retard ce que l\u2019on vient d\u2019\u00e9prouver et de remarquer; sinon,\nl\u2019oubli vient vite ou total ou partiel; l\u2019oubli total est sans gravit\u00e9;\nmais l\u2019oubli partiel est perfide; car si l\u2019on se met ensuite \u00e0 raconter\nce que l\u2019on n\u2019a pas oubli\u00e9, on est expos\u00e9 \u00e0 compl\u00e9ter par imagination\nles fragments incoh\u00e9rents et disjoints fourni par la m\u00e9moire ...; on\ndevient artiste \u00e0 son insu, et le r\u00e9cit, p\u00e9riodiquement r\u00e9p\u00e9t\u00e9 s\u2019impose\n\u00e0 la cr\u00e9ance de son auteur, qui, de bonne foi, le pr\u00e9sente comme un fait\nauthentique, d\u00fbment \u00e9tabli selon les bonnes m\u00e9thodes....\u201d\nSimilarly Spitta,[64] who seems to think that it is only in our attempt\nto reproduce the dream that we put in order the loosely associated dream\nelements: \u201cTo make connection out of disconnection, that is, to add the\nprocess of logical connection which is absent in the dream.\u201d\nAs we do not at present possess any other objective control for the\nreliability of our memory, and as indeed such a control is impossible in\nexamining the dream which is our own experience, and for which our\nmemory is the only source, it is a question what value we may attach to\nour recollections of dreams.\n(_e_) _The Psychological Peculiarities of Dreams._\u2014In the scientific\ninvestigation of the dream we start with the assumption that the dream\nis an occurrence of our own psychic activity; nevertheless the finished\ndream appears to us as something strange, the authorship of which we are\nso little forced to recognise that we can just as easily say \u201ca dream\nappeared to me,\u201d as \u201cI have dreamt.\u201d Whence this \u201cpsychic strangeness\u201d\nof the dream? According to our discussion of the sources of dreams we\nmay suppose that it does not depend on the material reaching the dream\ncontent; because this is for the most part common to the dream life and\nwaking life. One may ask whether in the dream it is not changes in the\npsychic processes which call forth this impression, and may so put to\ntest a psychological characteristic of the dream.\nNo one has more strongly emphasized the essential difference between\ndream and waking life, and utilised this difference for more\nfar-reaching conclusions, than G. Th. Fechner[25] in some observations\nin his _Elements of Psychophysic_ (p. 520, part 11). He believes that\n\u201cneither the simple depression of conscious psychic life under the main\nthreshold,\u201d nor the distraction of attention from the influences of the\nouter world, suffices to explain the peculiarities of the dream life as\ncompared with the waking life. He rather believes that the scene of\ndreams is laid elsewhere than in the waking presentation life. \u201cIf the\nscene of the psychophysical activity were the same during the sleeping\nand the waking states, the dream, in my opinion, could only be a\ncontinuation of the waking ideation maintaining itself at a lower degree\nof intensity, and must moreover share with the latter its material and\nform. But the state of affairs is quite different.\u201d\nWhat Fechner really meant has never been made clear, nor has anybody\nelse, to my knowledge, followed further the road, the clue to which he\nindicated in this remark. An anatomical interpretation in the sense of\nphysiological brain localisations, or even in reference to histological\nsections of the cerebral cortex, will surely have to be excluded. The\nthought may, however, prove ingenious and fruitful if it can be referred\nto a psychic apparatus which is constructed out of many instances placed\none behind another.\nOther authors have been content to render prominent one or another of\nthe tangible psychological peculiarities of the dream life, and perhaps\nto take these as a starting point for more far-reaching attempts at\nexplanation.\nIt has been justly remarked that one of the main peculiarities of the\ndream life appears even in the state of falling asleep, and is to be\ndesignated as the phenomenon inducing sleep. According to\nSchleiermacher[61] (p. 351), the characteristic part of the waking state\nis the fact that the psychic activity occurs in ideas rather than in\npictures. But the dream thinks in pictures, and one may observe that\nwith the approach of sleep the voluntary activities become difficult in\nthe same measure as the involuntary appear, the latter belonging wholly\nto the class of pictures. The inability for such presentation work as we\nperceive to be intentionally desired, and the appearance of pictures\nwhich is regularly connected with this distraction, these are two\nqualities which are constant in the dream, and which in its\npsychological analysis we must recognise as essential characters of the\ndream life. Concerning the pictures\u2014the hypnogogic hallucinations\u2014we\nhave discovered that even in their content they are identical with the\ndream pictures.\nThe dream therefore thinks preponderately, but not exclusively, in\nvisual pictures. It also makes use of auditory pictures, and to a lesser\nextent of the impressions of the other senses. Much is also simply\nthought or imagined (probably represented by remnants of word\npresentations), just as in the waking state. But still what is\ncharacteristic for the dream is only those elements of the content which\nact like pictures, _i.e._ which resemble more the perceptions than the\nmemory presentations. Disregarding all the discussions concerning the\nnature of hallucinations, familiar to every psychiatrist, we can say,\nwith all well-versed authors, that the dream hallucinates, that is,\nreplaces thoughts through hallucinations. In this respect there is no\ndifference between visual and acoustic presentations; it has been\nnoticed that the memory of a succession of sounds with which one falls\nasleep becomes transformed while sinking into sleep into an\nhallucination of the same melody, so as to make room again on awakening,\nwhich may repeatedly alternate with falling into a slumber, for the\nsofter memory presentations which are differently formed in quality.\nThe transformation of an idea into an hallucination is not the only\ndeviation of the dream from a waking thought which perhaps corresponds\nto it. From these pictures the dream forms a situation, it presents\nsomething in the present, it dramatises an idea, as Spitta[64] (p. 145)\nputs it.[K] But the characteristic of this side of the dream life\nbecomes complete only when it is remembered that while dreaming we do\nnot\u2014as a rule; the exceptions require a special explanation\u2014imagine that\nwe are thinking, but that we are living through an experience, _i.e._,\nwe accept the hallucination with full belief. The criticism that this\nhas not been experienced but only thought in a peculiar\nmanner\u2014dreamt\u2014comes to us only on awakening. This character\ndistinguishes the genuine sleeping dream from day dreaming, which is\nnever confused with reality.\nThe characteristics of the dream life thus far considered have been\nsummed up by Burdach[8] (p. 476) in the following sentences: \u201cAs\ncharacteristic features of the dream we may add (_a_) that the\nsubjective activity of our mind appears as objective, inasmuch as our\nfaculty of perception perceives the products of phantasy as if they were\nsensory activities ... (_b_) sleep abrogates one\u2019s self-command, hence\nfalling asleep necessitates a certain amount of passivity.... The\nslumber pictures are conditioned by the relaxation of one\u2019s\nself-command.\u201d\nIt is a question now of attempting to explain the credulity of the mind\nin reference to the dream hallucinations, which can only appear after\nthe suspension of a certain arbitrary activity. Str\u00fcmpell[66] asserts\nthat the mind behaves in this respect correctly, and in conformity with\nits mechanism. The dream elements are by no means mere presentations,\nbut true and real experiences of the mind, similar to those that appear\nin the waking state as a result of the senses (p. 34). Whereas in the\nwaking state the mind represents and thinks in word pictures and\nlanguage, in the dream it represents and thinks in real tangible\npictures (p. 35). Besides, the dream manifests a consciousness of space\nby transferring the sensations and pictures, just as in the waking\nstate, into an outer space (p. 36). It must therefore be admitted that\nthe mind in the dream is in the same relation to its pictures and\nperceptions as in the waking state (p. 43). If, however, it is thereby\nled astray, this is due to the fact that it lacks in sleep the criticism\nwhich alone can distinguish between the sensory perceptions emanating\nfrom within or from without. It cannot subject its pictures to the tests\nwhich alone can prove their objective reality. It furthermore neglects\nto differentiate between pictures that are arbitrarily interchanged and\nothers where there is no free choice. It errs because it cannot apply to\nits content the law of causality (p. 58). In brief, its alienation from\nthe outer world contains also the reason for its belief in the\nsubjective dream world.\nDelb\u0153uf[16] reaches the same conclusion through a somewhat different\nline of argument. We give to the dream pictures the credence of reality\nbecause in sleep we have no other impressions to compare them with,\nbecause we are cut off from the outer world. But it is not perhaps\nbecause we are unable to make tests in our sleep, that we believe in the\ntruth of our hallucinations. The dream may delude us with all these\ntests, it may make us believe that we may touch the rose that we see in\nthe dream, and still we only dream. According to Delb\u0153uf there is no\nvalid criterion to show whether something is a dream or a conscious\nreality, except\u2014and that only in practical generality\u2014the fact of\nawakening. \u201cI declare delusional everything that is experienced between\nthe period of falling asleep and awakening, if I notice on awakening\nthat I lie in my bed undressed\u201d (p. 84). \u201cI have considered the dream\npictures real during sleep in consequence of the mental habit, which\ncannot be put to sleep, of perceiving an outer world with which I can\ncontrast my ego.\u201d[L]\nAs the deviation from the outer world is taken as the stamp for the most\nstriking characteristics of the dream, it will be worth while mentioning\nsome ingenious observations of old Burdach[8] which will throw light on\nthe relation of the sleeping mind to the outer world and at the same\ntime serve to prevent us from over-estimating the above deductions.\n\u201cSleep results only under the condition,\u201d says Burdach, \u201cthat the mind\nis not excited by sensory stimuli ... but it is not the lack of sensory\nstimuli that conditions sleep, but rather a lack of interest for the\nsame; some sensory impressions are even necessary in so far as they\nserve to calm the mind; thus the miller can fall asleep only when he\nhears the rattling of his mill, and he who finds it necessary to burn a\nlight at night, as a matter of precaution, cannot fall asleep in the\ndark\u201d (p. 457).\n\u201cThe psyche isolates itself during sleep from the outer world, and\nwithdraws from the periphery.... Nevertheless, the connection is not\nentirely interrupted; if one did not hear and feel even during sleep,\nbut only after awakening, he would certainly never awake. The\ncontinuance of sensation is even more plainly shown by the fact that we\nare not always awakened by the mere sensory force of the impression, but\nby the psychic relation of the same; an indifferent word does not arouse\nthe sleeper, but if called by name he awakens ...: hence the psyche\ndifferentiates sensations during sleep.... It is for this reason that we\nmay be awakened by the lack of a sensory stimulus if it relates to the\npresentation of an important thing; thus one awakens when the light is\nextinguished, and the miller when the mill comes to a standstill; that\nis, the awakening is due to the cessation of a sensory activity, which\npresupposes that it has been perceived, and that it has not disturbed\nthe mind, being indifferent or rather gratifying\u201d (p. 460, &c.).\nIf we are willing to disregard these objections, which are not to be\ntaken lightly, we still must admit that the qualities of the dream life\nthus far considered, which originate by withdrawing from the outer\nworld, cannot fully explain the strangeness of the dream. For otherwise\nit would be possible to change back the hallucinations of the dream into\npresentations and the situations of the dream into thoughts, and thus to\nperform the task of dream interpretation. Now this is what we do when we\nreproduce the dream from memory after awakening, and whether we are\nfully or only partially successful in this back translation the dream\nstill retains its mysteriousness undiminished.\nFurthermore all the authors assume unhesitatingly that still other more\nfar-reaching alterations take place in the presentation material of\nwaking life. One of them, Str\u00fcmpell,[66] expresses himself as follows\n(p. 17): \u201cWith the cessation of the objectively active outlook and of\nthe normal consciousness, the psyche loses the foundation in which were\nrooted the feelings, desires, interests, and actions. Those psychic\nstates, feelings, interests, estimates which cling in the waking state\nto the memory pictures also succumb to ... an obscure pressure, in\nconsequence of which their connection with the pictures becomes severed;\nthe perception pictures of things, persons, localities, events, and\nactions of the waking state are singly very abundantly reproduced, but\nnone of these brings along its psychic value. The latter is removed from\nthem, and hence they float about in the mind dependent upon their own\nresources....\u201d\nThis deprivation the picture suffers of its psychic value, which again\ngoes back to the derivation from the outer world, is according to\nStr\u00fcmpell mainly responsible for the impression of strangeness with\nwhich the dream is confronted in our memory.\nWe have heard that even falling asleep carries with it the abandonment\nof one of the psychic activities\u2014namely, the voluntary conduct of the\npresentation course. Thus the supposition, suggested also by other\ngrounds, obtrudes itself, that the sleeping state may extend its\ninfluence also over the psychic functions. One or the other of these\nfunctions is perhaps entirely suspended; whether the remaining ones\ncontinue to work undisturbed, whether they can furnish normal work under\nthe circumstances, is the next question. The idea occurs to us that the\npeculiarities of the dream may be explained through the inferior psychic\nactivity during the sleeping state, but now comes the impression made by\nthe dream upon our waking judgment which is contrary to such a\nconception. The dream is disconnected, it unites without hesitation the\nworst contradictions, it allows impossibilities, it disregards our\nauthoritative knowledge from the day, and evinces ethical and moral\ndulness. He who would behave in the waking state as the dream does in\nits situations would be considered insane. He who in the waking state\nwould speak in such manner or report such things as occur in the dream\ncontent, would impress us as confused and weak-minded. Thus we believe\nthat we are only finding words for the fact when we place but little\nvalue on the psychic activity in the dream, and especially when we\ndeclare that the higher intellectual activities are suspended or at\nleast much impaired in the dream.\nWith unusual unanimity\u2014the exceptions will be dealt with elsewhere\u2014the\nauthors have pronounced their judgments on the dream\u2014such judgments as\nlead immediately to a definite theory or explanation of the dream life.\nIt is time that I should supplement the _r\u00e9sum\u00e9_ which I have just given\nwith a collection of the utterances of different authors\u2014philosophers\nand physicians\u2014on the psychological character of the dream.\nAccording to Lemoine,[42] the incoherence of the dream picture is the\nonly essential character of the dream.\nMaury[48] agrees with him; he says (p. 163): \u201cIl n\u2019y a pas des r\u00eaves\nabsolument raisonnables et qui ne contiennent quelque incoh\u00e9rence,\nquelque anachronisme, quelque absurdit\u00e9.\u201d\nAccording to Hegel, quoted by Spitta,[64] the dream lacks all objective\nand comprehensible connection.\nDugas[19] says: \u201cLe r\u00eave, c\u2019est l\u2019anarchie psychique, affective et\nmentale, c\u2019est le jeu des fonctions livr\u00e9es \u00e0 elles-m\u00eames et s\u2019exer\u00e7ant\nsans contr\u00f4le et sans but; dans le r\u00eave l\u2019esprit est un automate\nspirituel.\u201d\n\u201cThe relaxation, solution, and confusion of the presentation life which\nis held together through the logical force of the central ego\u201d is\nconceded even by Volkelt[72] (p. 14), according to whose theory the\npsychic activity during sleep seems in no way aimless.\nThe absurdity of the presentation connections appearing in the dream can\nhardly be more strongly condemned than it was by Cicero (_De Divin._\nII.): \u201cNihil tam praepostere, tam incondite, tam monstruose cogitari\npotest, quod non possimus somniare.\u201d\nFechner[52] says (p. 522): \u201cIt is as if the psychological activity were\ntransferred from the brain of a reasonable being into the brain of a\nfool.\u201d\nRadestock[35] (p. 145) says: \u201cIt seems indeed impossible to recognise in\nthis absurd action any firm law. Having withdrawn itself from the strict\npolice of the rational will guiding the waking presentation life, and of\nthe attention, the dream whirls everything about kaleidoscopically in\nmad play.\u201d\nHildebrandt[35] (p. 45) says: \u201cWhat wonderful jumps the dreamer allows\nhimself, _e.g._, in his chain of reasoning! With what unconcern he sees\nthe most familiar laws of experience turned upside down! What ridiculous\ncontradictions he can tolerate in the orders of nature and society\nbefore things go too far, as we say, and the overstraining of the\nnonsense brings an awakening! We often multiply quite unconcernedly:\nthree times three make twenty; we are not at all surprised when a dog\nrecites poetry for us, when a dead person walks to his grave, and when a\nrock swims on the water; we go in all earnestness by high command to the\nduchy of Bernburg or the principality of Lichtenstein in order to\nobserve the navy of the country, or we allow ourselves to be recruited\nas a volunteer by Charles XII. shortly before the battle of Poltawa.\u201d\nBinz[4] (p. 33) points to a dream theory resulting from the impressions.\n\u201cAmong ten dreams nine at least have an absurd content. We unite in them\npersons or things which do not bear the slightest relation to one\nanother. In the next moment, as in a kaleidoscope, the grouping changes,\nif possible to one more nonsensical and irrational than before; thus the\nchanging play of the imperfectly sleeping brain continues until we\nawaken, and put our hand to our forehead and ask ourselves whether we\nreally still possess the faculty of rational imagination and thought.\u201d\nMaury[48] (p. 50) finds for the relation of the dream picture to the\nwaking thoughts, a comparison most impressive for the physician: \u201cLa\nproduction de ces images que chez l\u2019homme \u00e9veill\u00e9 fait le plus souvent\nna\u00eetre la volont\u00e9, correspond, pour l\u2019intelligence, \u00e0 ce que cont pour\nla motilit\u00e9 certains mouvements que nous offrent la chor\u00e9e et les\naffections paralytiques....\u201d For the rest, he considers the dream \u201ctoute\nune s\u00e9rie de d\u00e9gradation de la facult\u00e9 pensant et raisonant\u201d (p. 27).\nIt is hardly necessary to mention the utterances of the authors which\nrepeat Maury\u2019s assertion for the individual higher psychic activities.\nAccording to Str\u00fcmpell,[66] some logical mental operations based on\nrelations and connections disappear in the dream\u2014naturally also at\npoints where the nonsense is not obvious (p. 26). According to\nSpitta,[64] (p. 148) the presentations in the dream are entirely\nwithdrawn from the laws of causality. Radestock[54] and others emphasize\nthe weakness of judgment and decision in the dream. According to\nJodl[37] (p. 123), there is no critique in the dream, and no correcting\nof a series of perceptions through the content of the sum of\nconsciousness. The same author states that \u201call forms of conscious\nactivity occur in the dream, but they are imperfect, inhibited, and\nisolated from one another.\u201d The contradictions manifested in the dream\ntowards our conscious knowledge are explained by Stricker[77][78] (and\nmany others), on the ground that facts are forgotten in the dream and\nlogical relations between presentations are lost (p. 98), &c., &c.\nThe authors who in general speak thus unfavourably about the psychic\ncapacities in the dream, nevertheless admit that the dream retains a\ncertain remnant of psychic activity. Wundt,[76] whose teaching has\ninfluenced so many other workers in the dream problems, positively\nadmits this. One might inquire as to the kind and behaviour of the\nremnants of the psychic life which manifest themselves in the dream. It\nis now quite universally acknowledged that the reproductive capacity,\nthe memory in the dream, seems to have been least affected; indeed it\nmay show a certain superiority over the same function in the waking life\n(_vid. supra_, p. 10), although a part of the absurdities of the dream\nare to be explained by just this forgetfulness of the dream life.\nAccording to Spitta,[64] it is the emotional life of the psyche that is\nnot overtaken by sleep and that then directs the dream. \u201cBy emotion\n[\u201cGem\u00fcth\u201d] we understand the constant comprehension of the feelings as\nthe inmost subjective essence of man\u201d (p. 84).\nScholz[59] (p. 37) sees a psychic activity manifested in the dream in\nthe \u201callegorising interpretation\u201d to which the dream material is\nsubjected. Siebeck[62] verifies also in the dream the \u201csupplementary\ninterpretative activity\u201d (p. 11) which the mind exerts on all that is\nperceived and viewed. The judgment of the apparently highest psychic\nfunction, the consciousness, presents for the dream a special\ndifficulty. As we can know anything only through consciousness, there\ncan be no doubt as to its retention; Spitta, however, believes that only\nconsciousness is retained in the dream, and not self-consciousness.\nDelb\u0153uf[16] confesses that he is unable to conceive this\ndifferentiation.\nThe laws of association which govern the connection of ideas hold true\nalso for the dream pictures; indeed, their domination evinces itself in\na purer and stronger expression in the dream than elsewhere.\nStr\u00fcmpell[62] (p. 70) says: \u201cThe dream follows either the laws of\nundisguised presentations as it seems exclusively or organic stimuli\nalong with such presentations, that is, without being influenced by\nreflection and reason, \u00e6sthetic sense, and moral judgment.\u201d The authors\nwhose views I reproduce here conceive the formation of the dream in\nabout the following manner: The sum of sensation stimuli affecting sleep\nfrom the various sources, discussed elsewhere, at first awaken in the\nmind a sum of presentations which represent themselves as hallucinations\n(according to Wundt, it is more correct to say as illusions, because of\ntheir origin from outer and inner stimuli). These unite with one another\naccording to the known laws of association, and, following the same\nrules, in turn evoke a new series of presentations (pictures). This\nentire material is then elaborated as well as possible by the still\nactive remnant of the organising and thinking mental faculties (_cf._\nWundt[76] and Weygandt[75]). But thus far no one has been successful in\nfinding the motive which would decide that the awakening of pictures\nwhich do not originate objectively follow this or that law of\nassociation.\nBut it has been repeatedly observed that the associations which connect\nthe dream presentations with one another are of a particular kind, and\ndifferent from those found in the waking mental activity. Thus\nVolkelt[72] says: \u201cIn the dream, the ideas chase and hunt each other on\nthe strength of accidental similarities and barely perceptible\nconnections. All dreams are pervaded by such loose and free\nassociations.\u201d Maury[48] attaches great value to this characteristic of\nconnection between presentations, which allows him to bring the dream\nlife in closer analogy to certain mental disturbances. He recognises two\nmain characters of the _d\u00e9lire_: \u201c(1) une action spontan\u00e9e et comme\nautomatique de l\u2019esprit; (2) une association vicieuse et irreguli\u00e8re des\nid\u00e9es\u201d (p. 126). Maury gives us two excellent examples from his own\ndreams, in which the mere similarity of sound forms the connection of\nthe dream presentations. He dreamed once that he undertook a pilgrimage\n(_p\u00e9lerinage_) to Jerusalem or Mecca. After many adventures he was with\nthe chemist Pelletier; the latter after some talk gave him a zinc shovel\n(_pelle_) which became his long battle sword in the dream fragment which\nfollowed (p. 137). On another occasion he walked in a dream on the\nhighway and read the kilometres on the milestones; presently he was with\na spice merchant who had large scales with which to weigh Maury; the\nspice merchant then said to him: \u201cYou are not in Paris; but on the\nisland Gilolo.\u201d This was followed by many pictures, in which he saw the\nflower Lobelia, then the General Lopez, of whose demise he had read\nshortly before. He finally awoke while playing a game of lotto.\nWe are, however, quite prepared to hear that this depreciation of the\npsychic activities of the dream has not remained without contradiction\nfrom the other side. To be sure, contradiction seems difficult here. Nor\nis it of much significance that one of the depreciators of dream life,\nSpitta[64] (p. 118), assures us that the same psychological laws which\ngovern the waking state rule the dream also, or that another (Dugas[19])\nstates: \u201cLe r\u00eave n\u2019est pas d\u00e9raison ni m\u00eame irraison pure,\u201d as long as\nneither of them has made any effort to bring this estimation into\nharmony with the psychic anarchy and dissolution of all functions in the\ndream described by them. Upon others, however, the possibility seems to\nhave dawned that the madness of the dream is perhaps not without its\nmethod\u2014that it is perhaps only a sham, like that of the Danish prince,\nto whose madness the intelligent judgment here cited refers. These\nauthors must have refrained from judging by appearances, or the\nappearance which the dream showed to them was quite different.\nWithout wishing to linger at its apparent absurdity, Havelock Ellis[23]\nconsiders the dream as \u201can archaic world of vast emotions and imperfect\nthoughts,\u201d the study of which may make us acquainted with primitive\nstages of development of the psychic life. A thinker like Delb\u0153uf[16]\nasserts\u2014to be sure without adducing proof against the contradictory\nmaterial, and hence indeed unjustly: \u201cDans le sommeil, hormis la\nperception, toutes les facult\u00e9s de l\u2019esprit, intelligence, imagination,\nm\u00e9moire, volont\u00e9, moralit\u00e9, restant intactes dans leur essence;\nseulement, elles s\u2019appliquent \u00e0 des objets imaginaires et mobiles. Le\nsongeur est un acteur qui joue \u00e0 volont\u00e9 les fous et les sages, les\nbourreaux et les victimes, les nains et les g\u00e9ants, les d\u00e9mons et les\nanges\u201d (p. 222). The Marquis of Hervey, who is sharply controverted by\nMaury,[48] and whose work I could not obtain despite all effort, seems\nto combat most energetically the under-estimation of the psychic\ncapacity in the dream. Maury speaks of him as follows (p. 19): \u201cM. le\nMarquis d\u2019Hervey pr\u00eate \u00e0 l\u2019intelligence, durant le sommeil toute sa\nlibert\u00e9 d\u2019action et d\u2019attention et il ne semble faire consister le\nsommeil que dans l\u2019occlusion des sens, dans leur fermeture au monde\next\u00e9rieur; en sorte que l\u2019homme qui dort ne se distingu\u00e9 gu\u00e8re, selon sa\nmani\u00e8re de voir, de l\u2019homme qui laisse vaguer sa pens\u00e9e en se bouchant\nles sens; toute la diff\u00e9rence qui s\u00e9par\u00e9 alors la pens\u00e9e ordinaire du\ncelle du dormeur c\u2019est que, chez celui-ci, l\u2019id\u00e9e prend une forme\nvisible, objective et ressemble, \u00e0 s\u2019y m\u00e9prendre, \u00e0 la sensation\nd\u00e9termin\u00e9e par les objets ext\u00e9rieurs; le souvenir rev\u00eat l\u2019apparence du\nfait pr\u00e9sent.\u201d\nMaury adds, however; \u201cQu\u2019il y a une diff\u00e9rence de plus et capitale \u00e0\nsavoir que les facult\u00e9s intellectuelles de l\u2019homme endormi n\u2019offrent pas\nl\u2019\u00e9quilibre qu\u2019elles gardent chez l\u2019homme l\u2019\u00e9veill\u00e9.\u201d\nThe scale of the estimation of the dream as a psychic product has a\ngreat range in the literature; it reaches from the lowest\nunder-estimation, the expression of which we have come to know, through\nthe idea of a value not yet revealed to the over-estimation which places\nthe dream far above the capacities of the waking life. Hildebrandt,[35]\nwho, as we know, sketches the psychological characteristics into three\nantinomies, sums up in the third of these contradistinctions the extreme\npoints of this series as follows (p. 19): \u201cIt is between a climax, often\nan involution which raises itself to virtuosity, and on the other hand a\ndecided diminution and weakening of the psychic life often leading below\nthe human niveau.\u201d\n\u201cAs for the first, who could not confirm from his own experience that,\nin the creations and weavings of the genius of the dream, there\nsometimes comes to light a profundity and sincerity of emotion, a\ntenderness of feeling, a clearness of view, a fineness of observation,\nand a readiness of wit, all which we should modestly have to deny that\nwe possess as a constant property during the waking life? The dream has\na wonderful poetry, an excellent allegory, an incomparable humour, and a\ncharming irony. It views the world under the guise of a peculiar\nidealisation, and often raises the effect of its manifestations into the\nmost ingenious understanding of the essence lying at its basis. It\nrepresents for us earthly beauty in true heavenly radiance, the sublime\nin the highest majesty, the actually frightful in the most gruesome\nfigure, and the ridiculous in the indescribably drastic comical; and at\ntimes we are so full of one of these impressions after awakening that we\nimagine that such a thing has never been offered to us by the real\nworld.\u201d\nOne may ask, is it really the same object that the depreciating remarks\nand these inspired praises are meant for? Have the latter overlooked the\nstupid dreams and the former the thoughtful and ingenious dreams? And if\nboth kinds do occur\u2014that is, dreams that merit to be judged in this or\nthat manner\u2014does it not seem idle to seek the psychological character of\nthe dream? Would it not suffice to state that everything is possible in\nthe dream, from the lowest depreciation of the psychic life to a raising\nof the same which is unusual in the waking state? As convenient as this\nsolution would be it has this against it, that behind the efforts of all\ndream investigators, it seems to be presupposed that there is such a\ndefinable character of the dream, which is universally valid in its\nessential features and which must eliminate these contradictions.\nIt is unquestionable that the psychic capacities of the dream have found\nquicker and warmer recognition in that intellectual period which now\nlies behind us, when philosophy rather than exact natural science ruled\nintelligent minds. Utterances like those of Schubert, that the dream\nfrees the mind from the power of outer nature, that it liberates the\nsoul from the chains of the sensual, and similar opinions expressed by\nthe younger Fichte,[M] and others, who represent the dream as a soaring\nup of the psychic life to a higher stage, hardly seem conceivable to us\nto-day; they are only repeated at present by mystics and devotees. With\nthe advance of the scientific mode of thinking, a reaction took place in\nthe estimation of the dream. It is really the medical authors who are\nmost prone to underrate the psychic activity in the dream, as being\ninsignificant and invaluable, whereas, philosophers and unprofessional\nobservers\u2014amateur psychologists\u2014whose contributions in this realm can\nsurely not be overlooked, in better agreement with the popular ideas,\nhave mostly adhered to the psychic value of the dream. He who is\ninclined to underrate the psychic capacity in the dream prefers, as a\nmatter of course, the somatic exciting sources in the etiology of the\ndream; he who leaves to the dreaming mind the greater part of its\ncapacities, naturally has no reason for not also admitting independent\nstimuli for dreaming.\nAmong the superior activities which, even on sober comparison, one is\ntempted to ascribe to the dream life, memory is the most striking; we\nhave fully discussed the frequent experiences which prove this fact.\nAnother superiority of the dream life, frequently extolled by the old\nauthors, viz. that it can regard itself supreme in reference to distance\nof time and space, can be readily recognised as an illusion. This\nsuperiority, as observed by Hildebrandt,[35] is only illusional; the\ndream takes as much heed of time and space as the waking thought, and\nthis because it is only a form of thinking. The dream is supposed to\nenjoy still another advantage in reference to time; that is, it is\nindependent in still another sense of the passage of time. Dreams like\nthe guillotine dream of Maury,[48] reported above, seem to show that the\ndream can crowd together more perception content in a very short space\nof time than can be controlled by our psychic activity in the waking\nmind. These conclusions have been controverted, however, by many\narguments; the essays of Le Lorrain[45] and Egger[20] \u201cConcerning the\napparent duration of dreams\u201d gave rise to a long and interesting\ndiscussion which has probably not said the last word upon this delicate\nand far-reaching question.\nThat the dream has the ability to take up the intellectual work of the\nday and bring to a conclusion what has not been settled during the day,\nthat it can solve doubt and problems, and that it may become the source\nof new inspiration in poets and composers, seems to be indisputable, as\nis shown by many reports and by the collection compiled by\nChabaneix.[11] But even if there be no dispute as to the facts,\nnevertheless their interpretation is open in principle to a great many\ndoubts.\nFinally the asserted divinatory power of the dream forms an object of\ncontention in which hard unsurmountable reflection encounters obstinate\nand continued faith. It is indeed just that we should refrain from\ndenying all that is based on fact in this subject, as there is a\npossibility that a number of such cases may perhaps be explained on a\nnatural psychological basis.\n(_f_) _The Ethical Feelings in the Dream._\u2014For reasons which will be\nunderstood only after cognisance has been taken of my own investigations\nof the dream, I have separated from the psychology of the dream the\npartial problem whether and to what extent the moral dispositions and\nfeelings of the waking life extend into the dreams. The same\ncontradictions which we were surprised to observe in the authors\u2019\ndescriptions of all the other psychic capacities strike us again here.\nSome affirm decidedly that the dream knows nothing of moral obligations;\nothers as decidedly that the moral nature of man remains even in his\ndream life.\nA reference to our dream experience of every night seems to raise the\ncorrectness of the first assertion beyond doubt. Jessen[36] says (p.\n553): \u201cNor does one become better or more virtuous in the dream; on the\ncontrary, it seems that conscience is silent in the dream, inasmuch as\none feels no compassion and can commit the worst crimes, such as theft,\nmurder, and assassination, with perfect indifference and without\nsubsequent remorse.\u201d\nRadestock[54] (p. 146) says: \u201cIt is to be noticed that in the dream the\nassociations terminate and the ideas unite without being influenced by\nreflection and reason, \u00e6sthetic taste, and moral judgment; the judgment\nis extremely weak, and ethical indifference reigns supreme.\u201d\nVolkelt[72] (p. 23) expresses himself as follows: \u201cAs every one knows,\nthe sexual relationship in the dream is especially unbridled. Just as\nthe dreamer himself is shameless in the extreme, and wholly lacking\nmoral feeling and judgment, so also he sees others, even the most\nhonoured persons, engaged in actions which even in thought he would\nblush to associate with them in his waking state.\u201d\nUtterances like those of Schopenhauer, that in the dream every person\nacts and talks in accordance with his character, form the sharpest\ncontrast to those mentioned above. R. P. Fischer[N] maintains that the\nsubjective feelings and desires or affects and passions manifest\nthemselves in the wilfulness of the dream life, and that the moral\ncharacteristics of a person are mirrored in his dream.\nHaffner[32] (p. 25): \u201cWith rare exceptions ... a virtuous person will be\nvirtuous also in his dreams; he will resist temptation, and show no\nsympathy for hatred, envy, anger, and all other vices; while the sinful\nperson will, as a rule, also find in his dreams the pictures which he\nhas before him while awake.\u201d\nScholz[59] (p. 36): \u201cIn the dream there is truth; despite all masking in\npride or humility, we still recognise our own self.... The honest man\ndoes not commit any dishonourable offence even in the dream, or, if this\ndoes occur, he is terrified over it as if over something foreign to his\nnature. The Roman emperor who ordered one of his subjects to be executed\nbecause he dreamed that he cut off the emperor\u2019s head, was not wrong in\njustifying his action on the ground that he who has such dreams must\nhave similar thoughts while awake. About a thing that can have no place\nin our mind we therefore say significantly: \u2018I would never dream of such\na thing.\u2019\u201d\nPfaff,[O] varying a familiar proverb, says: \u201cTell me for a time your\ndreams, and I will tell you what you are within.\u201d\nThe short work of Hildebrandt,[35] from which I have already taken so\nmany quotations, a contribution to the dream problem as complete and as\nrich in thought as I found in the literature, places the problem of\nmorality in the dream as the central point of its interest. For\nHildebrandt, too, it is a strict rule that the purer the life, the purer\nthe dream; the impurer the former, the impurer the latter.\nThe moral nature of man remains even in the dream: \u201cBut while we are not\noffended nor made suspicious by an arithmetical error no matter how\nobvious, by a reversal of science no matter how romantic, or by an\nanachronism no matter how witty, we nevertheless do not lose sight of\nthe difference between good and evil, right and wrong, virtue and vice.\nNo matter how much of what follows us during the day may vanish in our\nhours of sleep\u2014Kant\u2019s categorical imperative sticks to our heels as an\ninseparable companion from whom we cannot rid ourselves even in\nslumber.... This can be explained, however, only by the fact that the\nfundamental in human nature, the moral essence, is too firmly fixed to\ntake part in the activity of the kaleidoscopic shaking up to which\nphantasy, reason, memory, and other faculties of the same rank succumb\nin the dream\u201d (p. 45, &c.).\nIn the further discussion of the subject we find remarkable distortion\nand inconsequence in both groups of authors. Strictly speaking, interest\nin immoral dreams would cease for all those who assert that the moral\npersonality of the person crumbles away in the dream. They could just as\ncalmly reject the attempt to hold the dreamer responsible for his\ndreams, and to draw inferences from the badness of his dreams as to an\nevil strain in his nature, as they rejected the apparently similar\nattempt to demonstrate the insignificance of his intellectual life in\nthe waking state from the absurdity of his dreams. The others for whom\n\u201cthe categorical imperative\u201d extends also into the dream, would have to\naccept full responsibility for the immoral dreams; it would only be\ndesirable for their own sake that their own objectionable dreams should\nnot lead them to abandon the otherwise firmly held estimation of their\nown morality.\nStill it seems that no one knows exactly about himself how good or how\nbad he is, and that no one can deny the recollection of his own immoral\ndreams. For besides the opposition already mentioned in the criticism of\nthe morality of the dream, both groups of authors display an effort to\nexplain the origin of the immoral dream and a new opposition is\ndeveloped, depending on whether their origin is sought in the functions\nof the psychic life or in the somatically determined injuries to this\nlife. The urgent force of the facts then permits the representatives of\nthe responsibility, as well as of the irresponsibility of the dream\nlife, to agree in the recognition of a special psychic source for the\nimmorality of dreams.\nAll those who allow the continuance of the morality in the dream\nnevertheless guard against accepting full responsibility for their\ndreams. Haffner[32] says (p. 24): \u201cWe are not responsible for dreams\nbecause the basis upon which alone our life has truth and reality is\nremoved from our thoughts.... Hence there can be no dream wishing and\ndream acting, no virtue or sin.\u201d Still the person is responsible for the\nsinful dream in so far as he brings it about indirectly. Just as in the\nwaking state, it is his duty to cleanse his moral mind, particularly so\nbefore retiring to sleep.\nThe analysis of this mixture of rejection and recognition of\nresponsibility for the moral content of the dream is followed much\nfurther by Hildebrandt. After specifying that the dramatic manner of\nrepresentation in the dream, the crowding together of the most\ncomplicated processes of deliberation in the briefest period of time,\nand the depreciation and the confusion of the presentation elements in\nthe dream admitted by him must be recognised as unfavourable to the\nimmoral aspect of dreams; he nevertheless confesses that, yielding to\nthe most earnest reflection, he is inclined simply to deny all\nresponsibility for faults and dream sins.\n(P. 49): \u201cIf we wish to reject very decisively any unjust accusation,\nespecially one that has reference to our intentions and convictions, we\nnaturally make use of the expression: I should never have dreamed of\nsuch a thing. By this we mean to say, of course, that we consider the\nrealm of the dream the last and remotest place in which we are to be\nheld responsible for our thoughts, because there these thoughts are only\nloosely and incoherently connected with our real being, so that we\nshould hardly still consider them as our own; but as we feel impelled\nexpressly to deny the existence of such thoughts, even in this realm, we\nthus at the same time indirectly admit that our justification will not\nbe complete if it does not reach to that point. And I believe that,\nthough unconsciously, we here speak the language of truth.\u201d\n(P. 52): \u201cNo dream thought can be imagined whose first motive has not\nalready moved through the mind while awake as some wish, desire, or\nimpulse.\u201d Concerning this original impulse we must say that the dream\nhas not discovered it\u2014it has only imitated and extended it, it has only\nelaborated a bit of historical material which it has found in us, into\ndramatic form; it enacts the words of the apostle: He who hates his\nbrother is a murderer. And whereas, after we awaken and become conscious\nof our moral strength, we may smile at the boldly executed structure of\nthe depraved dream, the original formative material, nevertheless, has\nno ridiculous side. One feels responsible for the transgressions of the\ndreamer, not for the whole sum, but still for a certain percentage. \u201cIn\nthis sense, which is difficult to impugn, we understand the words of\nChrist: Out of the heart come evil thoughts\u2014for we can hardly help being\nconvinced that every sin committed in the dream brings with it at least\na vague minimum of guilt.\u201d\nHildebrandt thus finds the source of the immorality of dreams in the\ngerms and indications of evil impulses which pass through our minds\nduring the day as tempting thoughts, and he sees fit to add these\nimmoral elements to the moral estimation of the personality. It is the\nsame thoughts and the same estimation of these thoughts, which, as we\nknow, have caused devout and holy men of all times to lament that they\nare evil sinners.\nThere is certainly no reason to doubt the general occurrence of these\ncontrasting presentations\u2014in most men and even also in other than\nethical spheres. The judgment of these at times has not been very\nearnest. In Spitta[64] we find the following relevant expression from A.\nZeller (Article \u201cIrre\u201d in the _Allgemeinen Encyklop\u00e4die der\nWissenschaften_ of Ersch and Gr\u00fcber, p. 144): \u201cThe mind is rarely so\nhappily organised as to possess at all times power enough not to be\ndisturbed, not only by unessential but also by perfectly ridiculous\nideas running counter to the usual clear trend of thought; indeed, the\ngreatest thinkers have had cause to complain of this dreamlike\ndisturbing and painful rabble of ideas, as it destroys their profoundest\nreflection and their most sacred and earnest mental work.\u201d\nA clearer light is thrown on the psychological status of this idea of\ncontrast by another observation of Hildebrandt, that the dream at times\nallows us to glance into the deep and inmost recesses of our being,\nwhich are generally closed to us in our waking state (p. 55). The same\nknowledge is revealed by Kant in his _Anthropology_, when he states that\nthe dream exists in order to lay bare for us our hidden dispositions and\nto reveal to us not what we are, but what we might have been if we had a\ndifferent education. Radestock[54] (p. 84) says that the dream often\nonly reveals to us what we do not wish to admit to ourselves, and that\nwe therefore unjustly condemn it as a liar and deceiver. That the\nappearance of impulses which are foreign to our consciousness is merely\nanalogous to the already familiar disposition which the dream makes of\nother material of the presentation, which is either absent or plays only\nan insignificant part in the waking state, has been called to our\nattention by observations like those of Benini,[3] who says: \u201cCerte\nnostre inclinazione che si credevano soffocate a spente da un pezzo, si\nridestano; passioni vecchie e sepolte rivivono; cose e persone a cui non\npensiamo mai, ci vengono dinanzi\u201d (p. 149). Volkelt[72] expresses\nhimself in a similar way: \u201cEven presentations which have entered into\nour consciousness almost unnoticed, and have never perhaps been brought\nout from oblivion, often announce through the dream their presence in\nthe mind\u201d (p. 105). Finally, it is not out of place to mention here\nthat, according to Schleiermacher,[61] the state of falling asleep is\naccompanied by the appearance of undesirable presentations (pictures).\nWe may comprise under \u201cundesirable presentations\u201d this entire material\nof presentations, the occurrence of which excites our wonder in immoral\nas well as in absurd dreams. The only important difference consists in\nthe fact that our undesirable presentations in the moral sphere exhibit\nan opposition to our other feelings, whereas the others simply appear\nstrange to us. Nothing has been done so far to enable us to remove this\ndifference through a more penetrating knowledge.\nBut what is the significance of the appearance of undesirable\npresentations in the dream? What inferences may be drawn for the\npsychology of the waking and dreaming mind from these nocturnal\nmanifestations of contrasting ethical impulses? We may here note a new\ndiversity of opinion, and once more a different grouping of the authors.\nThe stream of thought followed by Hildebrandt, and by others who\nrepresent his fundamental view, cannot be continued in any other way\nthan by ascribing to the immoral impulses a certain force even in the\nwaking state, which, to be sure, is inhibited from advancing to action,\nand asserting that something falls off during sleep, which, having the\neffect of an inhibition, has kept us from noticing the existence of such\nan impulse. The dream thus shows the real, if not the entire nature of\nman, and is a means of making the hidden psychic life accessible to our\nunderstanding. It is only on such assumption that Hildebrandt can\nattribute to the dream the r\u00f4le of monitor who calls our attention to\nthe moral ravages in the soul, just as in the opinion of physicians it\ncan announce a hitherto unobserved physical ailment. Spitta,[64] too,\ncannot be guided by any other conception when he refers to the stream of\nexcitement which, _e.g._, flows in upon the psyche during puberty, and\nconsoles the dreamer by saying that he has done everything in his power\nwhen he has led a strictly virtuous life during his waking state, when\nhe has made an effort to suppress the sinful thoughts as often as they\narise, and has kept them from maturing and becoming actions. According\nto this conception, we might designate the \u201cundesirable\u201d presentations\nas those that are \u201csuppressed\u201d during the day, and must recognise in\ntheir appearance a real psychic phenomenon.\nIf we followed other authors we would have no right to the last\ninference. For Jessen[36] the undesirable presentations in the dream as\nin the waking state, in fever and other deliria, merely have \u201cthe\ncharacter of a voluntary activity put to rest and a somewhat mechanical\nprocess of pictures and presentations produced by inner impulses\u201d (p.\n360). An immoral dream proves nothing for the psychic life of the\ndreamer except that he has in some way become cognizant of the ideas in\nquestion; it is surely not a psychic impulse of his own. Another author,\nMaury,[48] makes us question whether he, too, does not attribute to the\ndream state the capacity for dividing the psychic activity into its\ncomponents instead of destroying it aimlessly. He speaks as follows\nabout dreams in which one goes beyond the bounds of morality: \u201cCe sont\nnos penchants qui parlent et qui nous font agir, sans que la conscience\nnous retienne, bien que parfois elle nous avertisse. J\u2019ai mes d\u00e9fauts et\nmes penchants vicieux; \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tat de veille, je tache de lutter contre\neux, et il m\u2019arrive assez souvent de n\u2019y pas succomber. Mais dans mes\nsonges j\u2019y succombe toujours ou pour mieux dire j\u2019agis, par leur\nimpulsion, sans crainte et sans remords.... \u00c9videmment les visions qui\nse d\u00e9roulent devant ma pens\u00e9e et qui constituent le r\u00eave, me sont\nsugg\u00e9r\u00e9es par les incitations que je ressens et que ma volont\u00e9 absente\nne cherche pas \u00e0 refouler\u201d (p. 113).\nIf one believes in the capacity of the dream to reveal an actually\nexisting but repressed or concealed immoral disposition of the dreamer,\nhe could not emphasize his opinion more strongly than with the words of\nMaury (p. 115): \u201cEn r\u00eave l\u2019homme se r\u00e9v\u00e8le donc tout entier \u00e0 soi-m\u00eame\ndans sa nudit\u00e9 et sa mis\u00e8re natives. D\u00e8s qu\u2019il suspend l\u2019exercice de sa\nvolont\u00e9, il d\u00e9vient le jouet de toutes les passions contre lesquelles, \u00e0\nl\u2019\u00e9tat de veille, la conscience, le sentiment d\u2019honneur, la crainte nous\nd\u00e9fendent.\u201d In another place he finds the following striking words (p.\n462): \u201cDans le r\u00eave, c\u2019est surtout l\u2019homme instinctif que se r\u00e9v\u00e8le....\nL\u2019homme revient pour ainsi dire \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tat de nature quand il r\u00eave; mais\nmoins les id\u00e9es acquises ont p\u00e9n\u00e9tr\u00e9 dans son esprit, plus les penchants\nen d\u00e9saccord avec elles conservent encore sur lui d\u2019influence dans le\nr\u00eave.\u201d He then mentions as an example that his dreams often show him as\na victim of just those superstitions which he most violently combats in\nhis writing.\nThe value of all these ingenious observations for a psychological\nknowledge of the dream life, however, is marred by Maury through the\nfact that he refuses to recognise in the phenomena so correctly observed\nby him any proof of the \u201cautomatisme psychologique\u201d which in his opinion\ndominates the dream life. He conceives this automatism as a perfect\ncontrast to the psychic activity.\nA passage in the studies on consciousness by Stricker[77] reads: \u201cThe\ndream does not consist of delusions merely; if, _e.g._, one is afraid of\nrobbers in the dream, the robbers are, of course, imaginary, but the\nfear is real. One\u2019s attention is thus called to the fact that the\neffective development in the dream does not admit of the judgment which\none bestows upon the rest of the dream content, and the problem arises\nwhat part of the psychic processes in the dream may be real, _i.e._ what\npart of them may demand to be enrolled among the psychic processes of\nthe waking state?\u201d\n(_g_) _Dream Theories and Functions of the Dream._\u2014A statement\nconcerning the dream which as far as possible attempts to explain from\none point of view many of its noted characters, and which at the same\ntime determines the relation of the dream to a more comprehensive sphere\nof manifestations, may be called a theory of dreams. Individual theories\nof the dream will be distinguished from one another through the fact\nthat they raise to prominence this or that characteristic of the dream,\nand connect explanations and relations with it. It will not be\nabsolutely necessary to derive from the theory a function, _i.e._ a use\nor any such activity of the dream, but our expectation, which is usually\nadjusted to teleology, will nevertheless welcome those theories which\npromise an understanding of the function of the dream.\nWe have already become acquainted with many conceptions of the dream\nwhich, more or less, merit the name of dream theories in this sense. The\nbelief of the ancients that the dream was sent by the gods in order to\nguide the actions of man was a complete theory of the dream giving\ninformation concerning everything in the dream worth knowing. Since the\ndream has become an object of biological investigation we have a greater\nnumber of theories, of which, however, some are very incomplete.\nIf we waive completeness, we may attempt the following loose grouping of\ndream theories based on their fundamental conception of the degree and\nmode of the psychic activity in the dream:\u2014\n1. Theories, like those of Delb\u0153uf,[16] which allow the full psychic\nactivity of the waking state to continue into the dream. Here the mind\ndoes not sleep; its apparatus remains intact, and, being placed under\nthe conditions different from the waking state, it must in normal\nactivity furnish results different from those of the waking state. In\nthese theories it is a question whether they are in position to derive\nthe distinctions between dreaming and waking thought altogether from the\ndeterminations of the sleeping state. They moreover lack a possible\naccess to a function of the dream; one cannot understand why one dreams,\nwhy the complicated mechanism of the psychic apparatus continues to play\neven when it is placed under conditions for which it is not apparently\nadapted. There remain only two expedient reactions\u2014to sleep dreamlessly\nor to awake when approached by disturbing stimuli\u2014instead of the third,\nthat of dreaming.\n2. Theories which, on the contrary, assume for the dream a diminution\nfor the psychic activity, a loosening of the connections, and an\nimpoverishment in available material. In accordance with these theories,\none must assume for sleep a psychological character entirely different\nfrom the one given by Delb\u0153uf. Sleep extends far beyond the mind\u2014it does\nnot consist merely in a shutting off of the mind from the outer world;\non the contrary, it penetrates into its mechanism, causing it at times\nto become useless. If I may draw a comparison from psychiatrical\nmaterial, I may say that the first theories construct the dream like a\nparanoia, while the second make it after the model of a dementia or an\namentia.\nThe theory that only a fragment of the psychic activity paralysed by\nsleep comes to expression is by far the favourite among the medical\nwriters and in the scientific world. As far as one may presuppose a more\ngeneral interest in dream interpretation, it may well be designated as\nthe ruling theory of the dream. It is to be emphasized with what\nfacility this particular theory escapes the worst rock threatening every\ndream interpretation, that is to say, being shipwrecked upon one of the\ncontrasts embodied in the dream. As this theory considers the dream the\nresult of a partial waking (or as Herbart\u2019s _Psychology_ of the dream\nsays, \u201ca gradual, partial, and at the same time very anomalous waking\u201d),\nit succeeds in covering the entire series of inferior activities in the\ndream which reveal themselves in its absurdities, up to the full\nconcentration of mental activity, by following a series of states which\nbecome more and more awake until they reach full awakening.\nOne who finds the psychological mode of expression indispensable, or who\nthinks more scientifically, will find this theory of the dream expressed\nin the discussion of Binz[4] (p. 43):\u2014\n\u201cThis state [of numbness], however, gradually approaches its end in the\nearly morning hours. The accumulated material of fatigue in the albumen\nof the brain gradually becomes less. It is gradually decomposed or\ncarried away by the constantly flowing circulation. Here and there some\nmasses of cells can be distinguished as awake, while all around\neverything still remains in a state of torpidity. _The isolated work of\nthe individual groups_ now appears before our clouded consciousness,\nwhich lacks the control of other parts of the brain governing the\nassociations. Hence the pictures created, which mostly correspond to the\nobjective impressions of the recent past, fit with each other in a wild\nand irregular manner. The number of the brain cells set free becomes\nconstantly greater, the irrationality of the dream constantly less.\u201d\nThe conception of the dream as an incomplete, partial waking state, or\ntraces of its influence, can surely be found among all modern\nphysiologists and philosophers. It is most completely represented by\nMaury.[48] It often seems as if this author represented to himself the\nstate of being awake or asleep in anatomical regions; at any rate it\nappears to him that an anatomical province is connected with a definite\npsychic function. I may here merely mention that if the theory of\npartial waking could be confirmed, there would remain much to be\naccomplished in its elaboration.\nNaturally a function of the dream cannot be found in this conception of\nthe dream life. On the contrary, the criticism of the status and\nimportance of the dream is consistently uttered in this statement of\nBinz (p. 357): \u201cAll the facts, as we see, urge us to characterise the\ndream as a physical process in all cases useless, in many cases even\nmorbid.\u201d\nThe expression \u201cphysical\u201d in reference to the dream, which owes its\nprominence to this author, points in more than one direction. In the\nfirst place, it refers to the etiology of the dream, which was\nespecially clear to Binz, as he studied the experimental production of\ndreams by the administration of poisons. It is certainly in keeping with\nthis kind of dream theory to ascribe the incitement of the dream\nexclusively to somatic origin whenever possible. Presented in the most\nextreme form, it reads as follows: After we have put ourselves to sleep\nby removing the stimuli, there would be no need and no occasion for\ndreaming until morning, when the gradual awakening through the incoming\nstimuli would be reflected in the phenomenon of dreaming. But as a\nmatter of fact, it is not possible to keep sleep free from stimuli; just\nas Mephisto complains about the germs of life, so stimuli reach the\nsleeper from every side\u2014from without, from within, and even from certain\nbodily regions which never give us any concern during the waking state.\nThus sleep is disturbed; the mind is aroused, now by this, now by that\nlittle thing, and functionates for a while with the awakened part only\nto be glad to fall asleep again. The dream is a reaction to the stimulus\ncausing a disturbance of sleep\u2014to be sure, it is a purely superfluous\nreaction.\nTo designate the dream as a physical process, which for all that remains\nan activity of the mental organ, has still another sense. It is meant to\ndispute the dignity of a psychic process for the dream. The application\nto the dream of the very old comparison of the \u201cten fingers of a\nmusically ignorant person running over the keyboard of an instrument,\u201d\nperhaps best illustrates in what estimation the dream activity has been\nheld by the representatives of exact science. In this sense it becomes\nsomething entirely untranslatable, for how could the ten fingers of an\nunmusical player produce any music?\nThe theory of partial wakefulness has not passed without objection even\nin early times. Thus Burdach,[8] in 1830, says: \u201cIf we say that the\ndream is a partial wakefulness, in the first place, we explain thereby\nneither the waking nor the sleeping state; secondly, this expresses\nnothing more than that certain forces of the mind are active in the\ndream while others are at rest. But such irregularities take place\nthroughout life....\u201d (p. 483).\nAmong extant dream theories which consider the dream a \u201cphysical\u201d\nprocess, there is one very interesting conception of the dream, first\npropounded by Robert[55] in 1866, which is attractive because it assigns\nto the dream a function or a useful end. As a basis for this theory,\nRobert takes from observation two facts which we have already discussed\nin our consideration of the dream material (see p. 13). These facts are:\nthat one very often dreams about the insignificant impressions of the\nday, and that one rarely carries over into the dream the absorbing\ninterests of the day. Robert asserts as exclusively correct, that things\nwhich have been fully settled never become dream inciters, but only such\nthings as are incomplete in the mind or touch it fleetingly (p. 11). \u201cWe\ncannot usually explain our dreams because their causes are to be found\n_in sensory impressions of the preceding day which have not attained\nsufficient recognition by the dreamer_.\u201d The conditions allowing an\nimpression to reach the dream are therefore, either that this impression\nhas been disturbed in its elaboration, or that being too insignificant\nit has no claim to such elaboration.\nRobert therefore conceives the dream \u201cas a physical process of\nelimination which has reached to cognition in the psychic manifestation\nof its reaction.\u201d _Dreams are eliminations of thoughts nipped in the\nbud._ \u201cA man deprived of the capacity for dreaming would surely in time\nbecome mentally unbalanced, because an immense number of unfinished and\nunsolved thoughts and superficial impressions would accumulate in his\nbrain, under the pressure of which there would be crushed all that\nshould be incorporated as a finished whole into memory.\u201d The dream acts\nas a safety-valve for the overburdened brain. _Dreams possess healing\nand unburdening properties_ (p. 32).\nIt would be a mistake to ask Robert how representation in the dream can\nbring about an unburdening of the mind. The author apparently concluded\nfrom those two peculiarities of the dream material that during sleep\nsuch ejection of worthless impressions is effected as a somatic process,\nand that dreaming is not a special psychic process but only the\nknowledge that we receive of such elimination. To be sure an elimination\nis not the only thing that takes place in the mind during sleep. Robert\nhimself adds that the incitements of the day are also elaborated, and\n\u201cwhat cannot be eliminated from the undigested thought material lying in\nthe mind becomes connected _by threads of thought borrowed from the\nphantasy into a finished whole_, and thus enrolled in the memory as a\nharmless phantasy picture\u201d (p. 23).\nBut it is in his criticism of the dream sources that Robert appears most\nbluntly opposed to the ruling theory. Whereas according to the existing\ntheory there would be no dream if the outer and inner sensory stimuli\ndid not repeatedly wake the mind, according to Robert the impulse to\ndream lies in the mind itself. It lies in the overcharging which demands\ndischarge, and Robert judges with perfect consistency when he maintains\nthat the causes determining the dream which depend on the physical state\nassume a subordinate rank, and could not incite dreams in a mind\ncontaining no material for dream formation taken from waking\nconsciousness. It is admitted, however, that the phantasy pictures\noriginating in the depths of the mind can be influenced by the nervous\nstimuli (p. 48). Thus, according to Robert, the dream is not quite so\ndependent on the somatic element. To be sure, it is not a psychic\nprocess, and has no place among the psychic processes of the waking\nstate; it is a nocturnal somatic process in the apparatus devoted to\nmental activity, and has a function to perform, viz. to guard this\napparatus against overstraining, or, if the comparison may be changed,\nto cleanse the mind.\nAnother author, Yves Delage,[15] bases his theory on the same\ncharacteristics of the dream, which become clear in the selection of the\ndream material, and it is instructive to observe how a slight turn in\nthe conception of the same things gives a final result of quite\ndifferent bearing.\nDelage, after having lost through death a person very dear to him, found\nfrom his own experience that we do not dream of what occupies us\nintently during the day, or that we begin to dream of it only after it\nis overshadowed by other interests of the day. His investigations among\nother persons corroborated the universality of this state of affairs.\nDelage makes a nice observation of this kind, if it turns out to be\ngenerally true, about the dreaming of newly married people: \u201cS\u2019ils ont\n\u00e9t\u00e9 fortement \u00e9pris, presque jamais ils n\u2019ont r\u00eave l\u2019un de l\u2019autre avant\nle mariage ou pendant la lune de miel; et s\u2019ils ont r\u00eave d\u2019amour c\u2019est\npour \u00eatre infid\u00e8les avec quelque personne indiff\u00e9rente ou odieuse.\u201d But\nwhat does one dream of? Delage recognises that the material occurring in\nour dreams consists of fragments and remnants of impressions from the\ndays preceding and former times. All that appears in our dreams, what at\nfirst we may be inclined to consider creations of the dream life, proves\non more thorough investigation to be unrecognised reproductions,\n\u201csouvenir inconscient.\u201d But this presentation material shows a common\ncharacter; it originates from impressions which have probably affected\nour senses more forcibly than our mind, or from which the attention has\nbeen deflected soon after their appearance. The less conscious, and at\nthe same time the stronger the impression, the more prospect it has of\nplaying a part in the next dream.\nThese are essentially the same two categories of impressions, the\ninsignificant and the unadjusted, which were emphasized by Robert,[55]\nbut Delage changes the connection by assuming that these impressions\nbecome the subject of dreams, not because they are indifferent, but\nbecause they are unadjusted. The insignificant impressions, too, are in\na way not fully adjusted; they, too, are from their nature as new\nimpressions \u201cautant de ressorts tendus,\u201d which will be relaxed during\nsleep. Still more entitled to a r\u00f4le in the dream than the weak and\nalmost unnoticed impression is a strong impression which has been\naccidentally detained in its elaboration or intentionally repressed. The\npsychic energy accumulated during the day through inhibition or\nsuppression becomes the mainspring of the dream at night.\nUnfortunately Delage stops here in his train of thought; he can ascribe\nonly the smallest part to an independent psychic activity in the dream,\nand thus in his dream theory reverts to the ruling doctrine of a partial\nsleep of the brain: \u201cEn somme le r\u00eave est le produit de la pens\u00e9e\nerrante, sans but et sans direction, se fixant successivement sur les\nsouvenirs, qui ont gard\u00e9 assez d\u2019intensit\u00e9 pour se placer sur sa route\net l\u2019arr\u00eater au passage, \u00e9tablissant entre eux un lien tant\u00f4t faible et\nind\u00e9cis, tant\u00f4t plus fort et plus serr\u00e9, selon que l\u2019activit\u00e9 actuelle\ndu cerveau est plus ou moins abolie par le sommeil.\u201d\nIn a third group we may include those dream theories which ascribe to\nthe dreaming mind the capacity and propensity for a special psychic\nactivity, which in the waking state it can accomplish either not at all\nor only in an imperfect manner. From the activity of these capacities\nthere usually results a useful function of the dream. The dignity\nbestowed upon the dream by older psychological authors falls chiefly in\nthis category. I shall content myself, however, with quoting, in their\nplace, the assertions of Burdach,[8] by virtue of which the dream \u201cis\nthe natural activity of the mind, which is not limited by the force of\nthe individuality, not disturbed by self-consciousness and not directed\nby self-determination, but is the state of life of the sensible central\npoint indulging in free play\u201d (p. 486).\nBurdach and others apparently consider this revelling in the free use of\none\u2019s own powers as a state in which the mind refreshes itself and takes\non new strength for the day work, something after the manner of a\nvacation holiday. Burdach, therefore, cites with approval the admirable\nwords in which the poet Novalis lauds the sway of the dream: \u201cThe dream\nis a bulwark against the regularity and commonness of life, a free\nrecreation of the fettered phantasy, in which it mixes together all the\npictures of life and interrupts the continued earnestness of grown-up\nmen with a joyous children\u2019s play. Without the dream we should surely\nage earlier, and thus the dream may be considered perhaps not a gift\ndirectly from above, but a delightful task, a friendly companion, on our\npilgrimage to the grave.\u201d\nThe refreshing and curative activity of the dream is even more\nimpressively depicted by Purkinje.[53] \u201cThe productive dreams in\nparticular would perform these functions. They are easy plays of the\nimagination, which have no connection with the events of the day. The\nmind does not wish to continue the tension of the waking life, but to\nrelease it and recuperate from it. It produces, in the first place,\nconditions opposed to those of the waking state. It cures sadness\nthrough joy, worry through hope and cheerfully distracting pictures,\nhatred through love and friendliness, and fear through courage and\nconfidence; it calms doubt through conviction and firm belief, and vain\nexpectations through realisation. Many sore spots in the mind, which the\nday keeps continually open, sleep heals by covering them and guarding\nagainst fresh excitement. Upon this the curative effect of time is\npartially based.\u201d We all feel that sleep is beneficial to the psychic\nlife, and the vague surmise of the popular consciousness apparently\ncannot be robbed of the notion that the dream is one of the ways in\nwhich sleep distributes its benefits.\nThe most original and most far-reaching attempt to explain the dream as\na special activity of the mind, which can freely display itself only in\nthe sleeping state, was the one undertaken by Scherner[58] in 1861.\nScherner\u2019s book, written in a heavy and bombastic style, inspired by an\nalmost intoxicated enthusiasm for the subject, which must repel us\nunless it can carry us away with it, places so many difficulties in the\nway of an analysis that we gladly resort to the clearer and shorter\ndescription in which the philosopher Volkelt[72] presents Scherner\u2019s\ntheories: \u201cFrom the mystic conglomerations and from all the gorgeous and\nmagnificent billows there indeed flashes and irradiates an ominous light\nof sense, but the path of the philosopher does not thereby become\nclearer.\u201d Such is the criticism of Scherner\u2019s description from one of\nhis own adherents.\nScherner does not belong to those authors who allow the mind to take\nalong its undiminished capacities into the dream life. He indeed\nexplains how in the dream the centrality and the spontaneous energy of\nthe ego are enervated, how cognition, feeling, will, and imagination\nbecome changed through this decentralisation, and how no true mental\ncharacter, but only the nature of a mechanism, belongs to the remnants\nof these psychic forces. But instead, the activity of the mind\ndesignated as phantasy, freed from all rational domination and hence\ncompletely uncontrolled, rises in the dream to absolute supremacy. To be\nsure, it takes the last building stones from the memory of the waking\nstate, but it builds with them constructions as different from the\nstructures of the waking state as day and night. It shows itself in the\ndream not only reproductive, but productive. Its peculiarities give to\nthe dream life its strange character. It shows a preference for the\nunlimited, exaggerated, and prodigious, but because freed from the\nimpeding thought categories, it gains a greater flexibility and agility\nand new pleasure; it is extremely sensitive to the delicate emotional\nstimuli of the mind and to the agitating affects, and it rapidly recasts\nthe inner life into the outer plastic clearness. The dream phantasy\nlacks the language of ideas; what it wishes to say, it must clearly\ndepict; and as the idea now acts strongly, it depicts it with the\nrichness, force, and immensity of the mode in question. Its language,\nhowever simple it may be, thus becomes circumstantial, cumbersome, and\nheavy. Clearness of language is rendered especially difficult by the\nfact that it shows a dislike for expressing an object by its own\npicture, but prefers a strange picture, if the latter can only express\nthat moment of the object which it wishes to describe. This is the\nsymbolising activity of the phantasy.... It is, moreover, of great\nsignificance that the dream phantasy copies objects not in detail, but\nonly in outline and even this in the broadest manner. Its paintings,\ntherefore, appear ingeniously light and graceful. The dream phantasy,\nhowever, does not stop at the mere representation of the object, but is\nimpelled from within to mingle with the object more or less of the dream\nego, and in this way to produce an action. The visual dream, _e.g._,\ndepicts gold coins in the street; the dreamer picks them up, rejoices,\nand carries them away.\nAccording to Scherner, the material upon which the dream phantasy exerts\nits artistic activity is preponderately that of the organic sensory\nstimuli which are so obscure during the day (comp. p. 29); hence the\nphantastic theory of Scherner, and the perhaps over-sober theories of\nWundt and other physiologists, though otherwise diametrically opposed,\nagree perfectly in their assumption of the dream sources and dream\nexcitants. But whereas, according to the physiological theory, the\npsychic reaction to the inner physical stimuli becomes exhausted with\nthe awakening of any ideas suitable to these stimuli, these ideas then\nby way of association calling to their aid other ideas, and with this\nstage the chain of psychic processes seeming to terminate according to\nScherner, the physical stimuli only supply the psychic force with a\nmaterial which it may render subservient to its phantastic intentions.\nFor Scherner the formation of the dream only commences where in the\nconception of others it comes to an end.\nThe treatment of the physical stimuli by the dream phantasy surely\ncannot be considered purposeful. The phantasy plays a tantalising game\nwith them, and represents the organic source which gives origin to the\nstimuli in the correspondent dream, in any plastic symbolism. Indeed\nScherner holds the opinion, not shared by Volkelt and others, that the\ndream phantasy has a certain favourite representation for the entire\norganism; this representation would be the _house_. Fortunately,\nhowever, it does not seem to limit itself in its presentation to this\nmaterial; it may also conversely employ a whole series of houses to\ndesignate a single organ, _e.g._, very long rows of houses for the\nintestinal excitation. On other occasions particular parts of the house\nactually represent particular parts of the body, as _e.g._, in the\nheadache-dream, the ceiling of the room (which the dream sees covered\nwith disgusting reptile-like spiders) represents the head.\nQuite irrespective of the house symbolism, any other suitable object may\nbe employed for the representation of these parts of the body which\nexcite the dream. \u201cThus the breathing lungs find their symbol in the\nflaming stove with its gaseous roaring, the heart in hollow boxes and\nbaskets, the bladder in round, bag-shaped, or simply hollowed objects.\nThe male dream of sexual excitement makes the dreamer find in the street\nthe upper portion of a clarinette, next to it the same part of a tobacco\npipe, and next to that a piece of fur. The clarinette and tobacco pipe\nrepresent the approximate shape of the male sexual organ, while the fur\nrepresents the pubic hair. In the female sexual dream the tightness of\nthe closely approximated thighs may be symbolised by a narrow courtyard\nsurrounded by houses, and the vagina by a very narrow, slippery and soft\nfootpath, leading through the courtyard, upon which the dreamer is\nobliged to walk, in order perhaps to carry a letter to a gentleman\u201d\n(Volkelt, p. 39). It is particularly noteworthy that at the end of such\na physically exciting dream, the phantasy, as it were, unmasks by\nrepresenting the exciting organ or its function unconcealed. Thus the\n\u201ctooth-exciting dream\u201d usually ends with the dreamer taking a tooth out\nof his mouth.\nThe dream phantasy may, however, not only direct its attention to the\nshape of the exciting organ, but it may also make the substance\ncontained therein the object of the symbolisation. Thus the dream of\nintestinal excitement, _e.g._, may lead us through muddy streets, the\nbladder-exciting dream to foaming water. Or the stimulus itself, the\nmanner of its excitation, and the object it covets, are represented\nsymbolically, or the dream ego enters into a concrete combination with\nthe symbolisation of its own state, as _e.g._, when, in the case of\npainful stimuli, we struggle desperately with vicious dogs or raging\nbulls, or when in the sexual dream the dreamer sees herself pursued by a\nnaked man. Disregarding all the possible prolixity of elaboration, a\nsymbolising phantastic activity remains as the central force of every\ndream. Volkelt,[72] in his finely and fervently written book, next\nattempted to penetrate further into the character of this phantasy and\nto assign to the psychical activity thus recognised, its position in a\nsystem of philosophical ideas, which, however, remains altogether too\ndifficult of comprehension for any one who is not prepared by previous\nschooling for the sympathetic comprehension of philosophical modes of\nthinking.\nScherner connects no useful function with the activity of the\nsymbolising phantasy in dreams. In the dream the psyche plays with the\nstimuli at its disposal. One might presume that it plays in an improper\nmanner. One might also ask us whether our thorough study of Scherner\u2019s\ndream theory, the arbitrariness and deviation of which from the rules of\nall investigation are only too obvious, can lead to any useful results.\nIt would then be proper for us to forestall the rejection of Scherner\u2019s\ntheory without examination by saying that this would be too arrogant.\nThis theory is built up on the impression received from his dreams by a\nman who paid great attention to them, and who would appear to be\npersonally very well fitted to trace obscure psychic occurrences.\nFurthermore it treats a subject which, for thousands of years, has\nappeared mysterious to humanity though rich in its contents and\nrelations; and for the elucidation of which stern science, as it\nconfesses itself, has contributed nothing beyond attempting, in entire\nopposition to popular sentiment, to deny the substance and significance\nof the object. Finally, let us frankly admit that apparently we cannot\navoid the phantastical in our attempts to elucidate the dream. There are\nalso phantastic ganglia cells; the passage cited on p. 63 from a sober\nand exact investigator like Binz,[4] which depicts how the aurora of\nawakening flows along the dormant cell masses of the cerebrum, is not\ninferior in fancifulness and in improbability to Scherner\u2019s attempts at\ninterpretation. I hope to be able to demonstrate that there is something\nactual underlying the latter, though it has only been indistinctly\nobserved and does not possess the character of universality entitling it\nto the claim of a dream theory. For the present, Scherner\u2019s theory of\nthe dream, in its contrast to the medical theory, may perhaps lead us to\nrealise between what extremes the explanation of dream life is still\nunsteadily vacillating.\n(_h_) _Relations between the Dream and Mental Diseases._\u2014When we speak\nof the relation of the dream to mental disturbances, we may think of\nthree different things: (1) Etiological and clinical relations, as when\na dream represents or initiates a psychotic condition, or when it leaves\nsuch a condition behind it. (2) Changes to which the dream life is\nsubjected in mental diseases. (3) Inner relations between the dream and\nthe psychoses, analogies indicating an intimate relationship. These\nmanifold relations between the two series of phenomena have been a\nfavourite theme of medical authors in the earlier periods of medical\nscience\u2014and again in recent times\u2014as we learn from the literature on the\nsubject gathered from Spitta,[64] Radestock,[54] Maury,[48] and\nTissi\u00e9.[68] Sante de Sanctis has lately directed his attention to this\nrelationship. For the purposes of our discussion it will suffice merely\nto glance at this important subject.\nIn regard to the clinical and etiological relations between the dream\nand the psychoses, I will report the following observations as\nparadigms. Hohnbaum asserts (see Krauss, p. 39), that the first attack\nof insanity frequently originates in an anxious and terrifying dream,\nand that the ruling idea has connection with this dream. Sante de\nSanctis adduces similar observations in paranoiacs, and declares the\ndream to be, in some of them, the \u201cvraie cause d\u00e9terminante de la\nfolie.\u201d The psychosis may come to life all of a sudden with the dream\ncausing and containing the explanation for the mental disturbances, or\nit may slowly develop through further dreams that have yet to struggle\nagainst doubt. In one of de Sanctis\u2019s cases, the affecting dream was\naccompanied by light hysterical attacks, which in their turn were\nfollowed by an anxious, melancholic state. F\u00e9r\u00e9 (cited by Tissi\u00e9) refers\nto a dream which caused an hysterical paralysis. Here the dream is\noffered us as an etiology of mental disturbance, though we equally\nconsider the prevailing conditions when we declare that the mental\ndisturbance shows its first manifestation in dream life, that it has its\nfirst outbreak in the dream. In other instances the dream life contained\nthe morbid symptoms, or the psychosis was limited to the dream life.\nThus Thomayer[70] calls attention to anxiety dreams which must be\nconceived as equivalent to epileptic attacks. Allison has described\nnocturnal insanity (cited by Radestock), in which the subjects are\napparently perfectly well in the day-time, while hallucinations, fits of\nfrenzy, and the like regularly appear at night. De Sanctis and Tissi\u00e9\nreport similar observations (paranoiac dream-equivalent in an alcoholic,\nvoices accusing a wife of infidelity). Tissi\u00e9 reports abundant\nobservations from recent times in which actions of a pathological\ncharacter (based on delusions, obsessive impulses) had their origin in\ndreams. Guislain describes a case in which sleep was replaced by an\nintermittent insanity.\nThere is hardly any doubt that along with the psychology of the dream,\nthe physician will one day occupy himself with the psychopathology of\nthe dream.\nIn cases of convalescence from insanity, it is often especially obvious\nthat, while the functions of the day are normal, the dream life may\nstill belong to the psychosis. Gregory is said first to have called\nattention to such cases (cited by Krauss[39]). Macario (reported by\nTissi\u00e9) gives account of a maniac who, a week after his complete\nrecovery again experienced in dreams the flight of ideas and the\npassionate impulses of his disease.\nConcerning the changes to which the dream life is subjected in chronic\npsychotic persons, very few investigations have so far been made. On the\nother hand, timely attention has been called to the inner relationship\nbetween the dream and mental disturbance, which shows itself in an\nextensive agreement of the manifestations occurring to both. According\nto Maury,[47] Cubanis, in his _Rapports du physique et du moral_, first\ncalled attention to this; following him came Lelut, J. Moreau, and more\nparticularly the philosopher Maine de Biran. To be sure, the comparison\nis still older. Radestock[54] begins the chapter dealing with this\ncomparison, by giving a collection of expressions showing the analogy\nbetween the dream and insanity. Kant somewhere says: \u201cThe lunatic is a\ndreamer in the waking state.\u201d According to Krauss \u201cInsanity is a dream\nwith the senses awake.\u201d Schopenhauer terms the dream a short insanity,\nand insanity a long dream. Hagen describes the delirium as dream life\nwhich has not been caused by sleep but by disease. Wundt, in the\n_Physiological Psychology_, declares: \u201cAs a matter of fact we may in the\ndream ourselves live through almost all symptoms which we meet in the\ninsane asylums.\u201d\nThe specific agreements, on the basis of which such an identification\ncommends itself to the understanding, are enumerated by Spitta.[64] And\nindeed, very similarly, by Maury in the following grouping: \u201c(1)\nSuspension or at least retardation, of self-consciousness, consequent\nignorance of the condition as such, and hence incapability of\nastonishment and lack of moral consciousness. (2) Modified perception of\nthe sensory organs; that is, perception is diminished in the dream and\ngenerally enhanced in insanity. (3) Combination of ideas with each other\nexclusively in accordance with the laws of association and of\nreproduction, hence automatic formation of groups and for this reason\ndisproportion in the relations between ideas (exaggerations, phantasms).\nAnd as a result of all this: (4) Changing or transformation of the\npersonality and at times of the peculiarities of character\n(perversities).\u201d\nRadestock gives some additional features or analogies in the material:\n\u201cMost hallucinations and illusions are found in the sphere of the senses\nof sight and hearing and general sensation. As in the dream, the\nsmallest number of elements is supplied by the senses of smell and\ntaste. The fever patient, like the dreamer, is assaulted by\nreminiscences from the remote past; what the waking and healthy man\nseems to have forgotten is recollected in sleep and in disease.\u201d The\nanalogy between the dream and the psychosis receives its full value only\nwhen, like a family resemblance, it is extended to the finer mimicry and\nto the individual peculiarities of facial expression.\n\u201cTo him who is tortured by physical and mental sufferings the dream\naccords what has been denied him by reality, to wit, physical well-being\nand happiness; so the insane, too, see the bright pictures of happiness,\ngreatness, sublimity, and riches. The supposed possession of estates and\nthe imaginary fulfilment of wishes, the denial or destruction of which\nhave just served as a psychic cause of the insanity, often form the main\ncontent of the delirium. The woman who has lost a dearly beloved child,\nin her delirium experiences maternal joys; the man who has suffered\nreverses of fortune deems himself immensely wealthy; and the jilted girl\npictures herself in the bliss of tender love.\u201d\nThe above passage from Radestock, an abstract of a keen discussion of\nGriesinger[31] (p. 111), reveals with the greatest clearness the wish\nfulfilment as a characteristic of the imagination, common to the dream\nand the psychosis. (My own investigations have taught me that here the\nkey to a psychological theory of the dream and of the psychosis is to be\nfound.)\n\u201cAbsurd combinations of ideas and weakness of judgment are the main\ncharacteristics of the dream and of insanity.\u201d The over-estimation of\none\u2019s own mental capacity, which appears absurd to sober judgment, is\nfound alike both in one and the other, and the rapid course of ideas in\nthe dream corresponds to the flight of ideas in the psychosis. Both are\ndevoid of any measure of time. The dissociation of personality in the\ndream, which, for instance, distributes one\u2019s own knowledge between two\npersons, one of whom, the strange one, corrects in the dream one\u2019s own\nego, fully corresponds to the well-known splitting of personality in\nhallucinatory paranoia; the dreamer, too, hears his own thoughts\nexpressed by strange voices. Even the constant delusions find their\nanalogy in the stereotyped recurring pathological dreams (_r\u00eave\nobs\u00e9dant_). After recovering from a delirium, patients not infrequently\ndeclare that the disease appeared to them like an uncomfortable dream;\nindeed, they inform us that occasionally, even during the course of\ntheir sickness, they have felt that they were only dreaming, just as it\nfrequently happens in the sleeping dream.\nConsidering all this, it is not surprising that Radestock condenses his\nown opinion and that of many others into the following: \u201cInsanity, an\nabnormal phenomenon of disease, is to be regarded as an enhancement of\nthe periodically recurring normal dream states\u201d (p. 228).\nKrauss[39] attempted to base the relationship between the dream and\ninsanity upon the etiology (or rather upon the exciting sources),\nperhaps making the relationship even more intimate than was possible\nthrough the analogy of the phenomena they manifest. According to him,\nthe fundamental element common to both is, as we have learned, the\norganically determined sensation, the sensation of physical stimuli, the\ngeneral feeling produced by contributions from all the organs. _Cf._\nPeise, cited by Maury[48] (p. 60).\nThe incontestable agreement between the dream and mental disturbance,\nextending into characteristic details, constitutes one of the strongest\nsupports of the medical theory of dream life, according to which the\ndream is represented as a useless and disturbing process and as the\nexpression of a reduced psychic activity. One cannot expect, however, to\nderive the final explanation of the dream from the mental disturbances,\nas it is generally known in what unsatisfactory state our understanding\nof the origin of the latter remains. It is very probably, however, that\na modified conception of the dream must also influence our views in\nregard to the inner mechanism of mental disturbances, and hence we may\nsay that we are engaged in the elucidation of the psychosis when we\nendeavour to clear up the mystery of the dream.\nI shall have to justify myself for not extending my summary of the\nliterature of the dream problems over the period between the first\nappearance of this book and its second edition. If this justification\nmay not seem very satisfactory to the reader, I was nevertheless\ninfluenced by it. The motives which mainly induced me to summarise the\ntreatment of the dream in the literature have been exhausted with the\nforegoing introduction; to have continued with this work would have cost\nme extraordinary effort and would have afforded little advantage or\nknowledge. For the period of nine years referred to has yielded nothing\nnew or valuable either for the conception of the dream in actual\nmaterial or in points of view. In most of the publications that have\nsince appeared my work has remained unmentioned and unregarded;\nnaturally least attention has been bestowed upon it by the so-called\n\u201cinvestigators of dreams,\u201d who have thus afforded a splendid example of\nthe aversion characteristic of scientific men to learning something new.\n\u201cLes savants ne sont pas curieux,\u201d said the scoffer Anatole France. If\nthere were such a thing in science as right to revenge, I in turn should\nbe justified in ignoring the literature since the appearance of this\nbook. The few accounts that have appeared in scientific journals are so\nfull of folly and misconception that my only possible answer to my\ncritics would be to request them to read this book over again. Perhaps\nalso the request should be that they read it as a whole.\nIn the works of those physicians who make use of the psychoanalytic\nmethod of treatment (Jung, Abraham, Riklin, Muthmann, Stekel, Rank, and\nothers), an abundance of dreams have been reported and interpreted in\naccordance with my instructions. In so far as these works go beyond the\nconfirmation of my assertions I have noted their results in the context\nof my discussion. A supplement to the literary index at the end of this\nbook brings together the most important of these new publications. The\nvoluminous book on the dream by Sante de Sanctis, of which a German\ntranslation appeared soon after its publication, has, so to speak,\ncrossed with mine, so that I could take as little notice of him as the\nItalian author could of me. Unfortunately, I am further obliged to\ndeclare that this laborious work is exceedingly poor in ideas, so poor\nthat one could never divine from it the existence of the problems\ntreated by me.\nI have finally to mention two publications which show a near relation to\nmy treatment of the dream problems. A younger philosopher, H. Swoboda,\nwho has undertaken to extend W. Fliesse\u2019s discovery of biological\nperiodicity (in groups of twenty-three and twenty-eight days) to the\npsychic field, has produced an imaginative work,[P] in which, among\nother things, he has used this key to solve the riddle of the dream. The\ninterpretation of dreams would herein have fared badly; the material\ncontained in dreams would be explained through the coincidence of all\nthose memories which during the night complete one of the biological\nperiods for the first or the n-th time. A personal statement from the\nauthor led me to assume that he himself no longer wished to advocate\nthis theory earnestly. But it seems I was mistaken in this conclusion; I\nshall report in another place some observations in reference to\nSwoboda\u2019s assertion, concerning the conclusions of which I am, however,\nnot convinced. It gave me far greater pleasure to find accidentally, in\nan unexpected place, a conception of the dream in essentials fully\nagreeing with my own. The circumstances of time preclude the possibility\nthat this conception was influenced by a reading of my book; I must\ntherefore greet this as the only demonstrable concurrence in the\nliterature with the essence of my dream theory. The book which contains\nthe passage concerning the dream which I have in mind was published as a\nsecond edition in 1900 by Lynkus under the title _Phantasien eines\nRealisten_.\nII\nMETHOD OF DREAM INTERPRETATION\nTHE ANALYSIS OF A SAMPLE DREAM\nThe title which I have given my treatise indicates the tradition which I\nwish to make the starting-point in my discussion of dreams. I have made\nit my task to show that dreams are capable of interpretation, and\ncontributions to the solution of the dream problems that have just been\ntreated can only be yielded as possible by-products of the settlement of\nmy own particular problem. With the hypothesis that dreams are\ninterpretable, I at once come into contradiction with the prevailing\ndream science, in fact with all dream theories except that of Scherner,\nfor to \u201cinterpret a dream\u201d means to declare its meaning, to replace it\nby something which takes its place in the concatenation of our psychic\nactivities as a link of full importance and value. But, as we have\nlearnt, the scientific theories of the dream leave no room for a problem\nof dream interpretation, for, in the first place, according to these,\nthe dream is no psychic action, but a somatic process which makes itself\nknown to the psychic apparatus by means of signs. The opinion of the\nmasses has always been quite different. It asserts its privilege of\nproceeding illogically, and although it admits the dream to be\nincomprehensible and absurd, it cannot summon the resolution to deny the\ndream all significance. Led by a dim intuition, it seems rather to\nassume that the dream has a meaning, albeit a hidden one; that it is\nintended as a substitute for some other thought process, and that it is\nonly a question of revealing this substitute correctly in order to reach\nthe hidden signification of the dream.\nThe laity has, therefore, always endeavoured to \u201cinterpret\u201d the dream,\nand in doing so has tried two essentially different methods. The first\nof these procedures regards the dream content as a whole and seeks to\nreplace it by another content which is intelligible and in certain\nrespects analogous. This is symbolic dream interpretation; it naturally\ngoes to pieces at the outset in the case of those dreams which appear\nnot only unintelligible but confused. The construction which the\nbiblical Joseph places upon the dream of Pharaoh furnishes an example of\nits procedure. The seven fat kine, after which came seven lean ones\nwhich devour the former, furnish a symbolic substitute for a prediction\nof seven years of famine in the land of Egypt, which will consume all\nthe excess which seven fruitful years have created. Most of the\nartificial dreams contrived by poets are intended for such symbolic\ninterpretation, for they reproduce the thought conceived by the poet in\na disguise found to be in accordance with the characteristics of our\ndreaming, as we know these from experience.[Q] The idea that the dream\nconcerns itself chiefly with future events whose course it surmises in\nadvance\u2014a relic of the prophetic significance with which dreams were\nonce credited\u2014now becomes the motive for transplanting the meaning of\nthe dream, found by means of symbolic interpretation, into the future by\nmeans of an \u201cit shall.\u201d\nA demonstration of the way in which such symbolic interpretation is\narrived at cannot, of course, be given. Success remains a matter of\ningenious conjecture, of direct intuition, and for this reason dream\ninterpretation has naturally been elevated to an art, which seems to\ndepend upon extraordinary gifts.[R] The other of the two popular methods\nof dream interpretation entirely abandons such claims. It might be\ndesignated as the \u201ccipher method,\u201d since it treats the dream as a kind\nof secret code, in which every sign is translated into another sign of\nknown meaning, according to an established key. For example, I have\ndreamt of a letter, and also of a funeral or the like; I consult a\n\u201cdream book,\u201d and find that \u201cletter\u201d is to be translated by \u201cvexation,\u201d\nand \u201cfuneral\u201d by \u201cmarriage, engagement.\u201d It now remains to establish a\nconnection, which I again am to assume pertains to the future, by means\nof the rigmarole which I have deciphered. An interesting variation of\nthis cipher procedure, a variation by which its character of purely\nmechanical transference is to a certain extent corrected, is presented\nin the work on dream interpretation by Artemidoros of Daldis.[2] Here\nnot only the dream content, but also the personality and station in life\nof the dreamer, are taken into consideration, so that the same dream\ncontent has a significance for the rich man, the married man, or the\norator, which is different from that for the poor man, the unmarried\nman, or, say, the merchant. The essential point, then, in this procedure\nis that the work of interpretation is not directed to the entirety of\nthe dream, but to each portion of the dream content by itself, as though\nthe dream were a conglomeration, in which each fragment demands a\nparticular disposal. Incoherent and confused dreams are certainly the\nones responsible for the invention of the cipher method.[S]\nThe worthlessness of both these popular interpretation procedures for\nthe scientific treatment of the subject cannot be questioned for a\nmoment. The symbolic method is limited in its application and is capable\nof no general demonstration. In the cipher method everything depends\nupon whether the key, the dream book, is reliable, and for that all\nguarantees are lacking. One might be tempted to grant the contention of\nthe philosophers and psychiatrists and to dismiss the problem of dream\ninterpretation as a fanciful one.\nI have come, however, to think differently. I have been forced to admit\nthat here once more we have one of those not infrequent cases where an\nancient and stubbornly retained popular belief seems to have come nearer\nto the truth of the matter than the judgment of the science which\nprevails to-day. I must insist that the dream actually has significance,\nand that a scientific procedure in dream interpretation is possible. I\nhave come upon the knowledge of this procedure in the following manner:\u2014\nFor several years I have been occupied with the solution of certain\npsychopathological structures in hysterical phobias, compulsive ideas,\nand the like, for therapeutic purposes. I have been so occupied since\nbecoming familiar with an important report of Joseph Breuer to the\neffect that in those structures, regarded as morbid symptoms, solution\nand treatment go hand in hand.[T] Where it has been possible to trace\nsuch a pathological idea back to the elements in the psychic life of the\npatient to which it owes its origin, this idea has crumbled away, and\nthe patient has been relieved of it. In view of the failure of our other\ntherapeutic efforts, and in the face of the mysteriousness of these\nconditions, it seems to me tempting, in spite of all difficulties, to\npress forward on the path taken by Breuer until the subject has been\nfully understood. We shall have elsewhere to make a detailed report upon\nthe form which the technique of this procedure has finally assumed, and\nthe results of the efforts which have been made. In the course of these\npsychoanalytical studies, I happened upon dream interpretation. My\npatients, after I had obliged them to inform me of all the ideas and\nthoughts which came to them in connection with the given theme, related\ntheir dreams, and thus taught me that a dream may be linked into the\npsychic concatenation which must be followed backwards into the memory\nfrom the pathological idea as a starting-point. The next step was to\ntreat the dream as a symptom, and to apply to it the method of\ninterpretation which had been worked out for such symptoms.\nFor this a certain psychic preparation of the patient is necessary. The\ndouble effort is made with him, to stimulate his attention for his\npsychic perceptions and to eliminate the critique with which he is\nordinarily in the habit of viewing the thoughts which come to the\nsurface in him. For the purpose of self-observation with concentrated\nattention, it is advantageous that the patient occupy a restful position\nand close his eyes; he must be explicitly commanded to resign the\ncritique of the thought-formations which he perceives. He must be told\nfurther that the success of the psychoanalysis depends upon his noticing\nand telling everything that passes through his mind, and that he must\nnot allow himself to suppress one idea because it seems to him\nunimportant or irrelevant to the subject, or another because it seems\nnonsensical. He must maintain impartiality towards his ideas; for it\nwould be owing to just this critique if he were unsuccessful in finding\nthe desired solution of the dream, the obsession, or the like.\nI have noticed in the course of my psychoanalytic work that the state of\nmind of a man in contemplation is entirely different from that of a man\nwho is observing his psychic processes. In contemplation there is a\ngreater play of psychic action than in the most attentive\nself-observation; this is also shown by the tense attitude and wrinkled\nbrow of contemplation, in contrast with the restful features of\nself-observation. In both cases, there must be concentration of\nattention, but, besides this, in contemplation one exercises a critique,\nin consequence of which he rejects some of the ideas which he has\nperceived, and cuts short others, so that he does not follow the trains\nof thought which they would open; toward still other thoughts he may act\nin such a manner that they do not become conscious at all\u2014that is to\nsay, they are suppressed before they are perceived. In self-observation,\non the other hand, one has only the task of suppressing the critique; if\nhe succeeds in this, an unlimited number of ideas, which otherwise would\nhave been impossible for him to grasp, come to his consciousness. With\nthe aid of this material, newly secured for the purpose of\nself-observation, the interpretation of pathological ideas, as well as\nof dream images, can be accomplished. As may be seen, the point is to\nbring about a psychic state to some extent analogous as regards the\napportionment of psychic energy (transferable attention) to the state\nprior to falling asleep (and indeed also to the hypnotic state). In\nfalling asleep, the \u201cundesired ideas\u201d come into prominence on account of\nthe slackening of a certain arbitrary (and certainly also critical)\naction, which we allow to exert an influence upon the trend of our\nideas; we are accustomed to assign \u201cfatigue\u201d as the reason for this\nslackening; the emerging undesired ideas as the reason are changed into\nvisual and acoustic images. (_Cf._ the remarks of Schleiermacher[61] and\nothers, p. 40.) In the condition which is used for the analysis of\ndreams and pathological ideas, this activity is purposely and\narbitrarily dispensed with, and the psychic energy thus saved, or a part\nof it, is used for the attentive following of the undesired thoughts now\ncoming to the surface, which retain their identity as ideas (this is the\ndifference from the condition of falling asleep). \u201cUndesired ideas\u201d are\nthus changed into \u201cdesired\u201d ones.\nThe suspension thus required of the critique for these apparently\n\u201cfreely rising\u201d ideas, which is here demanded and which is usually\nexercised on them, is not easy for some persons. The \u201cundesired ideas\u201d\nare in the habit of starting the most violent resistance, which seeks to\nprevent them from coming to the surface. But if we may credit our great\npoet-philosopher Friedrich Schiller, a very similar tolerance must be\nthe condition of poetic production. At a point in his correspondence\nwith Koerner, for the noting of which we are indebted to Mr. Otto Rank,\nSchiller answers a friend who complains of his lack of creativeness in\nthe following words: \u201cThe reason for your complaint lies, it seems to\nme, in the constraint which your intelligence imposes upon your\nimagination. I must here make an observation and illustrate it by an\nallegory. It does not seem beneficial, and it is harmful for the\ncreative work of the mind, if the intelligence inspects too closely the\nideas already pouring in, as it were, at the gates. Regarded by itself,\nan idea may be very trifling and very adventurous, but it perhaps\nbecomes important on account of one which follows it; perhaps in a\ncertain connection with others, which may seem equally absurd, it is\ncapable of forming a very useful construction. The intelligence cannot\njudge all these things if it does not hold them steadily long enough to\nsee them in connection with the others. In the case of a creative mind,\nhowever, the intelligence has withdrawn its watchers from the gates, the\nideas rush in pell-mell, and it is only then that the great heap is\nlooked over and critically examined. Messrs. Critics, or whatever else\nyou may call yourselves, you are ashamed or afraid of the momentary and\ntransitory madness which is found in all creators, and whose longer or\nshorter duration distinguishes the thinking artist from the dreamer.\nHence your complaints about barrenness, for you reject too soon and\ndiscriminate too severely\u201d (Letter of December 1, 1788).\nAnd yet, \u201csuch a withdrawal of the watchers from the gates of\nintelligence,\u201d as Schiller calls it, such a shifting into the condition\nof uncritical self-observation, is in no way difficult.\nMost of my patients accomplish it after the first instructions; I myself\ncan do it very perfectly, if I assist the operation by writing down my\nnotions. The amount, in terms of psychic energy, by which the critical\nactivity is in this manner reduced, and by which the intensity of the\nself-observation may be increased, varies widely according to the\nsubject matter upon which the attention is to be fixed.\nThe first step in the application of this procedure now teaches us that\nnot the dream as a whole, but only the parts of its contents separately,\nmay be made the object of our attention. If I ask a patient who is as\nyet unpractised: \u201cWhat occurs to you in connection with this dream?\u201d as\na rule he is unable to fix upon anything in his psychic field of vision.\nI must present the dream to him piece by piece, then for every fragment\nhe gives me a series of notions, which may be designated as the\n\u201cbackground thoughts\u201d of this part of the dream. In this first and\nimportant condition, then, the method of dream interpretation which I\nemploy avoids the popular, traditional method of interpretation by\nsymbolism famous in the legends, and approaches the second, the \u201ccipher\nmethod.\u201d Like this one it is an interpretation in detail, not _en\nmasse_; like this it treats the dream from the beginning as something\nput together\u2014as a conglomeration of psychic images.\nIn the course of my psychoanalysis of neurotics, I have indeed already\nsubjected many thousand dreams to interpretation, but I do not now wish\nto use this material in the introduction to the technique and theory of\ndream interpretation. Quite apart from the consideration that I should\nexpose myself to the objection that these are dreams of neuropathic\nsubjects, the conclusions drawn from which would not admit of\nreapplication to the dreams of healthy persons, another reason forces me\nto reject them. The theme which is naturally always the subject of these\ndreams, is the history of the disease which is responsible for the\nneurosis. For this purpose there would be required a very long\nintroduction and an investigation into the nature and logical conditions\nof psychoneuroses, things which are in themselves novel and unfamiliar\nin the highest degree, and which would thus distract attention from the\ndream problem. My purpose lies much more in the direction of preparing\nthe ground for a solution of difficult problems in the psychology of the\nneuroses by means of the solution of dreams. But if I eliminate the\ndreams of neurotics, I must not treat the remainder too\ndiscriminatingly. Only those dreams still remain which have been\noccasionally related to me by healthy persons of my acquaintance, or\nwhich I find as examples in the literature of dream life. Unfortunately\nin all these dreams the analysis is lacking, without which I cannot find\nthe meaning of the dream. My procedure is, of course, not as easy as\nthat of the popular cipher method, which translates the given dream\ncontent according to an established key; I am much more prepared to find\nthat the same dream may cover a different meaning in the case of\ndifferent persons, and in a different connection I must then resort to\nmy own dreams, as an abundant and convenient material, furnished by a\nperson who is about normal, and having reference to many incidents of\neveryday life. I shall certainly be with doubts as to the\ntrustworthiness of these \u201cself-analyses.\u201d Arbitrariness is here in no\nway avoided. In my opinion, conditions are more likely to be favourable\nin self-observation than in the observation of others; in any case, it\nis permissible to see how much can be accomplished by means of\nself-analysis. I must overcome further difficulties arising from inner\nself. One has a readily understood aversion to exposing so many intimate\nthings from one\u2019s own psychic life, and one does not feel safe from the\nmisinterpretation of strangers. But one must be able to put one\u2019s self\nbeyond this. \u201cToute psychologiste,\u201d writes Delb\u0153uf,[26] \u201cest oblig\u00e9 de\nfaire l\u2019aveu m\u00eame de ses faiblesses s\u2019il croit par l\u00e0 jeter du jour sur\nquelque probl\u00e8me obscure.\u201d And I may assume that in the case of the\nreader, the immediate interest in the indiscretions which I must commit\nwill very soon give way to exclusive engrossment in the psychological\nproblems which are illuminated by them.\nI shall, therefore, select one of my own dreams and use it to elucidate\nmy method of interpretation. Every such dream necessitates a preliminary\nstatement. I must now beg the reader to make my interests his own for a\nconsiderable time, and to become absorbed with me in the most trifling\ndetails of my life, for an interest in the hidden significance of dreams\nimperatively demands such transference.\nPreliminary statement: In the summer of 1895 I had psychoanalytically\ntreated a young lady who stood in close friendship to me and those near\nto me. It is to be understood that such a complication of relations may\nbe the source of manifold feelings for the physician, especially for the\npsychotherapist. The personal interest of the physician is greater, his\nauthority is less. A failure threatens to undermine the friendship with\nthe relatives of the patient. The cure ended with partial success, the\npatient got rid of her hysterical fear, but not of all her somatic\nsymptoms. I was at that time not yet sure of the criteria marking the\nfinal settlement of a hysterical case, and expected her to accept a\nsolution which did not seem acceptable to her. In this disagreement, we\ncut short the treatment on account of the summer season. One day a\nyounger colleague, one of my best friends, who had visited the\npatient\u2014Irma\u2014and her family in their country resort, came to see me. I\nasked him how he found her, and received the answer: \u201cShe is better, but\nnot altogether well.\u201d I realise that those words of my friend Otto, or\nthe tone of voice in which they were spoken, made me angry. I thought I\nheard a reproach in the words, perhaps to the effect that I had promised\nthe patient too much, and rightly or wrongly I traced Otto\u2019s supposed\nsiding against me to the influence of the relatives of the patient, who,\nI assume, had never approved of my treatment. Moreover, my disagreeable\nimpression did not become clear to me, nor did I give it expression. The\nvery same evening, I wrote down the history of Irma\u2019s case, in order to\nhand it, as though for my justification, to Dr. M., a mutual friend, who\nwas at that time a leading figure in our circle. During the night\nfollowing this evening (perhaps rather in the morning) I had the\nfollowing dream, which was registered immediately after waking:\u2014\nDREAM OF JULY 23\u201324, 1895\n_A great hall\u2014many guests whom we are receiving\u2014among them Irma, whom I\nimmediately take aside, as though to answer her letter, to reproach her\nfor not yet accepting the \u201csolution.\u201d I say to her: \u201cIf you still have\npains, it is really only your own fault.\u201d She answers: \u201cIf you only knew\nwhat pains I now have in the neck, stomach, and abdomen; I am drawn\ntogether.\u201d I am frightened and look at her. She looks pale and bloated;\nI think that after all I must be overlooking some organic affection. I\ntake her to the window and look into her throat. She shows some\nresistance to this, like a woman who has a false set of teeth. I think\nanyway she does not need them. The mouth then really opens without\ndifficulty and I find a large white spot to the right, and at another\nplace I see extended grayish-white scabs attached to curious curling\nformations, which have obviously been formed like the turbinated bone\u2014I\nquickly call Dr. M., who repeats the examination and confirms it.... Dr.\nM.\u2019s looks are altogether unusual; he is very pale, limps, and has no\nbeard on his chin.... My friend Otto is now also standing next to her,\nand my friend Leopold percusses her small body and says: \u201cShe has some\ndulness on the left below,\u201d and also calls attention to an infiltrated\nportion of the skin on the left shoulder (something which I feel as he\ndoes, in spite of the dress).... M. says: \u201cNo doubt it is an infection,\nbut it does not matter; dysentery will develop too, and the poison will\nbe excreted.... We also have immediate knowledge of the origin of the\ninfection. My friend Otto has recently given her an injection with a\npropyl preparation when she felt ill, propyls.... Propionic acid ...\nTrimethylamine (the formula of which I see printed before me in heavy\ntype).... Such injections are not made so rashly.... Probably also the\nsyringe was not clean.\u201d_\nThis dream has an advantage over many others. It is at once clear with\nwhat events of the preceding day it is connected, and what subject it\ntreats. The preliminary statement gives information on these points. The\nnews about Irma\u2019s health which I have received from Otto, the history of\nthe illness upon which I have written until late at night, have occupied\nmy psychic activity even during sleep. In spite of all this, no one, who\nhas read the preliminary report and has knowledge of the content of the\ndream, has been able to guess what the dream signifies. Nor do I myself\nknow. I wonder about the morbid symptoms, of which Irma complains in the\ndream, for they are not the same ones for which I have treated her. I\nsmile about the consultation with Dr. M. I smile at the nonsensical idea\nof an injection with propionic acid, and at the consolation attempted by\nDr. M. Towards the end the dream seems more obscure and more terse than\nat the beginning. In order to learn the significance of all this, I am\ncompelled to undertake a thorough analysis.\nANALYSIS\n_The hall\u2014many guests, whom we are receiving._\nWe were living this summer at the Bellevue, in an isolated house on one\nof the hills which lie close to the Kahlenberg. This house was once\nintended as a place of amusement, and on this account has unusually\nhigh, hall-like rooms. The dream also occurred at the Bellevue, a few\ndays before the birthday of my wife. During the day, my wife had\nexpressed the expectation that several friends, among them Irma, would\ncome to us as guests for her birthday. My dream, then, anticipates this\nsituation: It is the birthday of my wife, and many people, among them\nIrma, are received by us as guests in the great hall of the Bellevue.\n_I reproach Irma for not having accepted the solution. I say: \u201cIf you\nstill have pains, it is your own fault.\u201d_\nI might have said this also, or did say it, while awake. At that time I\nhad the opinion (recognised later to be incorrect) that my task was\nlimited to informing patients of the hidden meaning of their symptoms.\nWhether they then accepted or did not accept the solution upon which\nsuccess depended\u2014for that I was not responsible. I am thankful to this\nerror, which fortunately has now been overcome, for making life easier\nfor me at a time when, with all my unavoidable ignorance, I was to\nproduce successful cures. But I see in the speech which I make to Irma\nin the dream, that above all things I do not want to be to blame for the\npains which she still feels. If it is Irma\u2019s own fault, it cannot be\nmine. Should the purpose of the dream be looked for in this quarter?\n_Irma\u2019s complaints; pains in the neck, abdomen, and stomach; she is\ndrawn together._\nPains in the stomach belonged to the symptom-complex of my patient, but\nthey were not very prominent; she complained rather of sensations of\nnausea and disgust. Pains in the neck and abdomen and constriction of\nthe throat hardly played a part in her case. I wonder why I decided upon\nthis choice of symptoms, nor can I for the moment find the reason.\n_She looks pale and bloated._\nMy patient was always ruddy. I suspect that another person is here being\nsubstituted for her.\n_I am frightened at the thought that I must have overlooked some organic\naffection._\nThis, as the reader will readily believe, is a constant fear with the\nspecialist, who sees neurotics almost exclusively, and who is accustomed\nto ascribe so many manifestations, which other physicians treat as\norganic, to hysteria. On the other hand, I am haunted by a faint doubt\u2014I\nknow not whence it comes\u2014as to whether my fear is altogether honest. If\nIrma\u2019s pains are indeed of organic origin, I am not bound to cure them.\nMy treatment, of course, removes only hysterical pains. It seems to me,\nin fact, that I wish to find an error in the diagnosis; in that case the\nreproach of being unsuccessful would be removed.\n_I take her to the window in order to look into her throat. She resists\na little, like a woman who has false teeth. I think she does not need\nthem anyway._\nI had never had occasion to inspect Irma\u2019s aural cavity. The incident in\nthe dream reminds me of an examination, made some time before, of a\ngoverness who at first gave an impression of youthful beauty, but who\nupon opening her mouth took certain measures for concealing her teeth.\nOther memories of medical examinations and of little secrets which are\ndiscovered by them, unpleasantly for both examiner and examined, connect\nthemselves with this case. \u201cShe does not need them anyway,\u201d is at first\nperhaps a compliment for Irma; but I suspect a different meaning. In\ncareful analysis one feels whether or not the \u201cbackground thoughts\u201d\nwhich are to be expected have been exhausted. The way in which Irma\nstands at the window suddenly reminds me of another experience. Irma\npossesses an intimate woman friend, of whom I think very highly. One\nevening on paying her a visit I found her in the position at the window\nreproduced in the dream, and her physician, the same Dr. M., declared\nthat she had a diphtheritic membrane. The person of Dr. M. and the\nmembrane return in the course of the dream. Now it occurs to me that\nduring the last few months, I have been given every reason to suppose\nthat this lady is also hysterical. Yes, Irma herself has betrayed this\nto me. But what do I know about her condition? Only the one thing, that\nlike Irma she suffers from hysterical choking in dreams. Thus in the\ndream I have replaced my patient by her friend. Now I remember that I\nhave often trifled with the expectation that this lady might likewise\nengage me to relieve her of her symptoms. But even at the time I thought\nit improbable, for she is of a very shy nature. _She resists_, as the\ndream shows. Another explanation might be that _she does not need it_;\nin fact, until now she has shown herself strong enough to master her\ncondition without outside help. Now only a few features remain, which I\ncan assign neither to Irma nor to her friend: _Pale, bloated, false\nteeth_. The false teeth lead me to the governess; I now feel inclined to\nbe satisfied with bad teeth. Then another person, to whom these features\nmay allude, occurs to me. She is not my patient, and I do not wish her\nto be my patient, for I have noticed that she is not at her ease with\nme, and I do not consider her a docile patient. She is generally pale,\nand once, when she had a particularly good spell, she was bloated.[U] I\nhave thus compared my patient Irma with two others, who would likewise\nresist treatment. What can it mean that I have exchanged her for her\nfriend in the dream? Perhaps that I wish to exchange her; either the\nother one arouses in me stronger sympathies or I have a higher opinion\nof her intelligence. For I consider Irma foolish because she does not\naccept my solution. The other one would be more sensible, and would thus\nbe more likely to yield. _The mouth then really opens without\ndifficulty_; she would tell more than Irma.[V]\n_What I see in the throat; a white spot and scabby nostrils._\nThe white spot recalls diphtheria, and thus Irma\u2019s friend, but besides\nthis it recalls the grave illness of my eldest daughter two years before\nand all the anxiety of that unfortunate time. The scab on the nostrils\nreminds me of a concern about my own health. At that time I often used\ncocaine in order to suppress annoying swellings in the nose, and had\nheard a few days before that a lady patient who did likewise had\ncontracted an extensive necrosis of the nasal mucous membrane. The\nrecommendation of cocaine, which I had made in 1885, had also brought\ngrave reproaches upon me. A dear friend, already dead in 1895, had\nhastened his end through the misuse of this remedy.\n_I quickly call Dr. M., who repeats the examination._\nThis would simply correspond to the position which M. occupied among us.\nBut the word \u201cquickly\u201d is striking enough to demand a special\nexplanation. It reminds me of a sad medical experience. By the continued\nprescription of a remedy (sulfonal) which was still at that time\nconsidered harmless, I had once caused the severe intoxication of a\nwoman patient, and I had turned in great haste to an older, more\nexperienced colleague for assistance. The fact that I really had this\ncase in mind is confirmed by an accessory circumstance. The patient, who\nsuccumbed to the intoxication, bore the same name as my eldest daughter.\nI had never thought of this until now; now it seems to me almost like a\nretribution of fate\u2014as though I ought to continue the replacement of the\npersons here in another sense; this Matilda for that Matilda; an eye for\nan eye, a tooth for a tooth. It is as though I were seeking every\nopportunity to reproach myself with lack of medical conscientiousness.\n_Dr. M. is pale, without a beard on his chin, and he limps._\nOf this so much is correct, that his unhealthy appearance often awakens\nthe concern of his friends. The other two characteristics must belong to\nanother person. A brother living abroad occurs to me, who wears his chin\nclean-shaven, and to whom, if I remember aright, M. of the dream on the\nwhole bears some resemblance. About him the news arrived some days\nbefore that he was lame on account of an arthritic disease in the hip.\nThere must be a reason why I fuse the two persons into one in the dream.\nI remember that in fact I was on bad terms with both of them for similar\nreasons. Both of them had rejected a certain proposal which I had\nrecently made to them.\n_My friend Otto is now standing next to the sick woman, and my friend\nLeopold examines her and calls attention to a dulness on the left\nbelow._\nMy friend Leopold is also a physician, a relative of Otto. Since the two\npractise the same specialty, fate has made them competitors, who are\ncontinually being compared with each other. Both of them assisted me for\nyears, while I was still directing a public dispensary for nervous\nchildren. Scenes like the one reproduced in the dream have often taken\nplace there. While I was debating with Otto about the diagnosis of a\ncase, Leopold had examined the child anew and had made an unexpected\ncontribution towards the decision. For there was a difference of\ncharacter between the two similar to that between Inspector Brassig and\nhis friend Charles. The one was distinguished for his brightness, the\nother was slow, thoughtful, but thorough. If I contrast Otto and the\ncareful Leopold in the dream, I do it, apparently, in order to extol\nLeopold. It is a comparison similar to the one above between the\ndisobedient patient Irma and her friend who is thought to be more\nsensible. I now become aware of one of the tracks along which the\nthought association of the dream progresses; from the sick child to the\nchildren\u2019s asylum. The dulness to the left, below, recalls a certain\ncase corresponding to it, in every detail in which Leopold astonished me\nby his thoroughness. Besides this, I have a notion of something like a\nmetastatic affection, but it might rather be a reference to the lady\npatient whom I should like to have instead of Irma. For this lady, as\nfar as I can gather, resembles a woman suffering from tuberculosis.\n_An infiltrated portion of skin on the left shoulder._\nI see at once that this is my own rheumatism of the shoulder, which I\nalways feel when I have remained awake until late at night. The turn of\nphrase in the dream also sounds ambiguous; something which I feel ... in\nspite of the dress. \u201cFeel on my own body\u201d is intended. Moreover, I am\nstruck with the unusual sound of the term \u201cinfiltrated portion of skin.\u201d\n\u201cAn infiltration behind on the upper left\u201d is what we are accustomed to;\nthis would refer to the lung, and thus again to tuberculosis patients.\n_In spite of the dress._\nThis, to be sure, is only an interpolation. We, of course, examine the\nchildren in the clinic undressed; it is some sort of contradiction to\nthe manner in which grown-up female patients must be examined. The story\nused to be told of a prominent clinician that he always examined his\npatients physically only through the clothes. The rest is obscure to me;\nI have, frankly, no inclination to follow the matter further.\n_Dr. M. says: \u201cIt is an infection, but it does not matter. Dysentery\nwill develop, and the poison will he excreted._\u201d\nThis at first seems ridiculous to me; still it must be carefully\nanalysed like everything else. Observed more closely, it seems, however,\nto have a kind of meaning. What I had found in the patient was local\ndiphtheritis. I remember the discussion about diphtheritis and\ndiphtheria at the time of my daughter\u2019s illness. The latter is the\ngeneral infection which proceeds from local diphtheritis. Leopold proves\nthe existence of such general infection by means of the dulness, which\nthus suggests a metastatic lesion. I believe, however, that just this\nkind of metastasis does not occur in the case of diphtheria. It rather\nrecalls py\u00e6mia.\n_It does not matter_, is a consolation. I believe it fits in as follows:\nThe last part of the dream has yielded a content to the effect that the\npains of the patient are the result of a serious organic affection. I\nbegin to suspect that with this I am only trying to shift the blame from\nmyself. Psychic treatment cannot be held responsible for the continued\npresence of diphtheritic affection. But now, in turn, I am disturbed at\ninventing such serious suffering for Irma for the sole purpose of\nexculpating myself. It seems cruel. I need (accordingly) the assurance\nthat the result will be happy, and it does not seem ill-advised that I\nshould put the words of consolation into the mouth of Dr. M. But here I\nconsider myself superior to the dream, a fact which needs explanation.\nBut why is this consolation so nonsensical?\n_Dysentery_:\nSome sort of far-fetched theoretical notion that pathological material\nmay be removed through the intestines. Am I in this way trying to make\nfun of Dr. M.\u2019s great store of far-fetched explanations, his habit of\nfinding curious pathological relationships? Dysentery suggests something\nelse. A few months ago I had in charge a young man suffering from\nremarkable pains during evacuation of the bowels, a case which\ncolleagues had treated as \u201can\u00e6mia with malnutrition.\u201d I realised that it\nwas a question of hysteria; I was unwilling to use my psychotherapy on\nhim, and sent him off on a sea voyage. Now a few days before I had\nreceived a despairing letter from him from Egypt, saying that while\nthere he had suffered a new attack, which the physician had declared to\nbe dysentery. I suspect, indeed, that the diagnosis was only an error of\nmy ignorant colleague, who allows hysteria to make a fool of him; but\nstill I cannot avoid reproaching myself for putting the invalid in a\nposition where he might contract an organic affection of the bowels in\naddition to his hysteria. Furthermore, dysentery sounds like diphtheria,\na word which does not occur in the dream.\nIndeed it must be that, with the consoling prognosis: \u201cDysentery will\ndevelop, &c.,\u201d I am making fun of Dr. M., for I recollect that years ago\nhe once jokingly told a very similar story of another colleague. He had\nbeen called to consult with this colleague in the case of a woman who\nwas very seriously ill and had felt obliged to confront the other\nphysician, who seemed very hopeful, with the fact that he found albumen\nin the patient\u2019s urine. The colleague, however, did not let this worry\nhim, but answered calmly: \u201cThat does not matter, doctor; the albumen\nwill without doubt be excreted.\u201d Thus I can no longer doubt that\nderision for those colleagues who are ignorant of hysteria is contained\nin this part of the dream. As though in confirmation, this question now\narises in my mind: \u201cDoes Dr. M. know that the symptoms of his patient,\nof our friend Irma, which give cause for fearing tuberculosis, are also\nbased on hysteria? Has he recognised this hysteria, or has he stupidly\nignored it?\u201d\nBut what can be my motive in treating this friend so badly? This is very\nsimple: Dr. M. agrees with my solution as little as Irma herself. I have\nthus already in this dream taken revenge on two persons, on Irma in the\nwords, \u201cIf you still have pains, it is your own fault,\u201d and on Dr. M. in\nthe wording of the nonsensical consolation which has been put into his\nmouth.\n_We have immediate knowledge of the origin of the infection._\nThis immediate knowledge in the dream is very remarkable. Just before we\ndid not know it, since the infection was first demonstrated by Leopold.\n_My friend Otto has recently given her an injection when she felt ill._\nOtto had actually related that in the short time of his visit to Irma\u2019s\nfamily, he had been called to a neighbouring hotel in order to give an\ninjection to some one who fell suddenly ill. Injections again recall the\nunfortunate friend who has poisoned himself with cocaine. I had\nrecommended the remedy to him merely for internal use during the\nwithdrawal of morphine, but he once gave himself injections of cocaine.\n_With a propyl preparation ... propyls ... propionic acid._ How did this\never occur to me? On the same evening on which I had written part of the\nhistory of the disease before having the dream, my wife opened a bottle\nof cordial labelled \u201cAnanas,\u201d[W] (which was a present from our friend\nOtto. For he had a habit of making presents on every possible occasion;\nI hope he will some day be cured of this by a wife).[X] Such a smell of\nfusel oil arose from this cordial that I refused to taste it. My wife\nobserved: \u201cWe will give this bottle to the servants,\u201d and I, still more\nprudent, forbade it, with the philanthropic remark: \u201cThey mustn\u2019t be\npoisoned either.\u201d The smell of fusel oil (amyl ...) has now apparently\nawakened in my memory the whole series, propyl, methyl, &c., which has\nfurnished the propyl preparation of the dream. In this, it is true, I\nhave employed a substitution; I have dreamt of propyl, after smelling\namyl, but substitutions of this kind are perhaps permissible, especially\nin organic chemistry.\n_Trimethylamin._ I see the chemical formula of this substance in the\ndream, a fact which probably gives evidence of a great effort on the\npart of my memory, and, moreover, the formula is printed in heavy type,\nas if to lay special stress upon something of particular importance, as\ndistinguished from the context. To what does this trimethylamin lead,\nwhich has been so forcibly called to my attention? It leads to a\nconversation with another friend who for years has known all my\ngerminating activities, as I have his. At that time he had just informed\nme of some of his ideas about sexual chemistry, and had mentioned, among\nothers, that he thought he recognised in trimethylamin one of the\nproducts of sexual metabolism. This substance thus leads me to\nsexuality, to that factor which I credit with the greatest significance\nfor the origin of the nervous affections which I attempt to cure. My\npatient Irma is a young widow; if I am anxious to excuse the failure of\nher cure, I suppose I shall best do so by referring to this condition,\nwhich her admirers would be glad to change. How remarkably, too, such a\ndream is fashioned! The other woman, whom I take as my patient in the\ndream instead of Irma, is also a young widow.\nI suspect why the formula of trimethylamin has made itself so prominent\nin the dream. So many important things are gathered up in this one word:\nTrimethylamin is not only an allusion to the overpowering factor of\nsexuality, but also to a person whose sympathy I remember with\nsatisfaction when I feel myself forsaken in my opinions. Should not this\nfriend, who plays such a large part in my life, occur again in the chain\nof thoughts of the dream? Of course, he must; he is particularly\nacquainted with the results which proceed from affections of the nose\nand its adjacent cavities, and has revealed to science several highly\nremarkable relations of the turbinated bones to the female sexual organs\n(the three curly formations in Irma\u2019s throat). I have had Irma examined\nby him to see whether the pains in her stomach might be of nasal origin.\nBut he himself suffers from suppurative rhinitis, which worries him, and\nto this perhaps there is an allusion in py\u00e6mia, which hovers before me\nin the metastases of the dream.\n_Such injections are not made so rashly._ Here the reproach of\ncarelessness is hurled directly at my friend Otto. I am under the\nimpression that I had some thought of this sort in the afternoon, when\nhe seemed to indicate his siding against me by word and look. It was\nperhaps: \u201cHow easily he can be influenced; how carelessly he pronounces\njudgment.\u201d Furthermore, the above sentence again points to my deceased\nfriend, who so lightly took refuge in cocaine injections. As I have\nsaid, I had not intended injections of the remedy at all. I see that in\nreproaching Otto I again touch upon the story of the unfortunate\nMatilda, from which arises the same reproach against me. Obviously I am\nhere collecting examples of my own conscientiousness, but also of the\nopposite.\n_Probably also the syringe was not clean._ Another reproach directed at\nOtto, but originating elsewhere. The day before I happened to meet the\nson of a lady eighty-two years of age whom I am obliged to give daily\ntwo injections of morphine. At present she is in the country, and I have\nheard that she is suffering from an inflammation of the veins. I\nimmediately thought that it was a case of infection due to contamination\nfrom the syringe. It is my pride that in two years I have not given her\na single infection; I am constantly concerned, of course, to see that\nthe syringe is perfectly clean. For I am conscientious. From the\ninflammation of the veins, I return to my wife, who had suffered from\nemboli during a period of pregnancy, and now three related situations\ncome to the surface in my memory, involving my wife, Irma, and the\ndeceased Matilda, the identity of which three persons plainly justifies\nmy putting them in one another\u2019s place.\nI have now completed the interpretation of the dream.[Y] In the course\nof this interpretation I have taken great pains to get possession of all\nthe notions to which a comparison between the dream content and the\ndream thoughts hidden behind it must have given rise. Meanwhile, the\n\u201cmeaning\u201d of the dream has dawned upon me. I have become conscious of a\npurpose which is realised by means of the dream, and which must have\nbeen the motive for dreaming. The dream fulfils several wishes, which\nhave been actuated in me by the events of the preceding evening (Otto\u2019s\nnews, and the writing down of the history of the disease). For the\nresult of the dream is that I am not to blame for the suffering which\nIrma still has, and that Otto is to blame for it. Now Otto has made me\nangry by his remark about Irma\u2019s imperfect cure; the dream avenges me\nupon him by turning the reproach back upon himself. The dream acquits me\nof responsibility for Irma\u2019s condition by referring it to other causes,\nwhich indeed furnish a great number of explanations. The dream\nrepresents a certain condition of affairs as I should wish it to be;\n_the content of the dream is thus the fulfilment of a wish; its motive\nis a wish_.\nThis much is apparent at first sight. But many things in the details of\nthe dream become intelligible when regarded from the point of view of\nwish-fulfilment. I take revenge on Otto, not only for hastily taking\npart against me, in that I accuse him of a careless medical operation\n(the injection), but I am also avenged on him for the bad cordial which\nsmells like fusel oil, and I find an expression in the dream which\nunites both reproaches; the injection with a preparation of propyl.\nStill I am not satisfied, but continue my revenge by comparing him to\nhis more reliable competitor. I seem to say by this: \u201cI like him better\nthan you.\u201d But Otto is not the only one who must feel the force of my\nanger. I take revenge on the disobedient patient by exchanging her for a\nmore sensible, more docile one. Nor do I leave the contradiction of Dr.\nM. unnoticed, but express my opinion of him in an obvious allusion, to\nthe effect that his relation to the question is that of _an ignoramus_\n(\u201c_dysentery will develop_,\u201d _&c._).\nIt seems to me, indeed, as though I were appealing from him to some one\nbetter informed (my friend, who has told me about trimethylamin); just\nas I have turned from Irma to her friend, I turn from Otto to Leopold.\nRid me of these three persons, replace them by three others of my own\nchoice, and I shall be released from the reproaches which I do not wish\nto have deserved! The unreasonableness itself of these reproaches is\nproved to me in the dream in the most elaborate way. Irma\u2019s pains are\nnot charged to me, because she herself is to blame for them, in that she\nrefuses to accept my solution. Irma\u2019s pains are none of my business, for\nthey are of an organic nature, quite impossible to be healed by a\npsychic cure. Irma\u2019s sufferings are satisfactorily explained by her\nwidowhood (trimethylamin!); a fact which, of course, I cannot alter.\nIrma\u2019s illness has been caused by an incautious injection on the part of\nOtto, with an ill-suited substance\u2014in a way I should never have made an\ninjection. Irma\u2019s suffering is the result of an injection made with an\nunclean syringe, just like the inflammation of the veins in my old lady,\nwhile I never do any such mischief with my injections. I am aware,\nindeed, that these explanations of Irma\u2019s illness, which unite in\nacquitting me, do not agree with one another; they even exclude one\nanother. The whole pleading\u2014this dream is nothing else\u2014recalls vividly\nthe defensive argument of a man who was accused by his neighbour of\nhaving returned a kettle to him in a damaged condition. In the first\nplace, he said, he had returned the kettle undamaged; in the second, it\nalready had holes in it when he borrowed it; and thirdly, he had never\nborrowed the kettle from his neighbour at all. But so much the better;\nif even one of these three methods of defence is recognised as valid,\nthe man must be acquitted.\nStill other subjects mingle in the dream, whose relation to my release\nfrom responsibility for Irma\u2019s illness is not so transparent: the\nillness of my daughter and that of a patient of the same name, the\nharmfulness of cocaine, the illness of my patient travelling in Egypt,\nconcern about the health of my wife, my brother, of Dr. M., my own\nbodily troubles, and concern about the absent friend who is suffering\nfrom suppurative rhinitis. But if I keep all these things in view, they\ncombine into a single train of thought, labelled perhaps: Concern for\nthe health of myself and others\u2014professional conscientiousness. I recall\nan undefined disagreeable sensation as Otto brought me the news of\nIrma\u2019s condition. I should like to note finally the expression of this\nfleeting sensation, which is part of the train of thought that is\nmingled into the dream. It is as though Otto had said to me: \u201cYou do not\ntake your physician\u2019s duties seriously enough, you are not\nconscientious, do not keep your promises.\u201d Thereupon this train of\nthought placed itself at my service in order that I might exhibit proof\nof the high degree in which I am conscientious, how intimately I am\nconcerned with the health of my relatives, friends, and patients.\nCuriously enough, there are also in this thought material some painful\nmemories, which correspond rather to the blame attributed to Otto than\nto the accusation against me. The material has the appearance of being\nimpartial, but the connection between this broader material, upon which\nthe dream depends, and the more limited theme of the dream which gives\nrise to the wish to be innocent of Irma\u2019s illness, is nevertheless\nunmistakable.\nI do not wish to claim that I have revealed the meaning of the dream\nentirely, or that the interpretation is flawless.\nI could still spend much time upon it; I could draw further explanations\nfrom it, and bring up new problems which it bids us consider. I even\nknow the points from which further thought associations might be traced;\nbut such considerations as are connected with every dream of one\u2019s own\nrestrain me from the work of interpretation. Whoever is ready to condemn\nsuch reserve, may himself try to be more straightforward than I. I am\ncontent with the discovery which has been just made. If the method of\ndream interpretation here indicated is followed, it will be found that\nthe dream really has meaning, and is by no means the expression of\nfragmentary brain activity, which the authors would have us believe.\n_When the work of interpretation has been completed the dream may be\nrecognised as the fulfilment of a wish._\nIII\nTHE DREAM IS THE FULFILMENT OF A WISH\nWhen after passing a defile one has reached an eminence where the ways\npart and where the view opens out broadly in different directions, it is\npermissible to stop for a moment and to consider where one is to turn\nnext. Something like this happens to us after we have mastered this\nfirst dream interpretation. We find ourselves in the open light of a\nsudden cognition. The dream is not comparable to the irregular sounds of\na musical instrument, which, instead of being touched by the hand of the\nmusician, is struck by some outside force; the dream is not senseless,\nnot absurd, does not presuppose that a part of our store of ideas is\ndormant while another part begins to awaken. It is a psychic phenomenon\nof full value, and indeed the fulfilment of a wish; it takes its place\nin the concatenation of the waking psychic actions which are\nintelligible to us, and it has been built up by a highly complicated\nintellectual activity. But at the very moment when we are inclined to\nrejoice in this discovery, a crowd of questions overwhelms us. If the\ndream, according to the interpretation, represents a wish fulfilled,\nwhat is the cause of the peculiar and unfamiliar manner in which this\nfulfilment is expressed? What changes have occurred in the dream\nthoughts before they are transformed into the manifest dream which we\nremember upon awaking? In what manner has this transformation taken\nplace? Whence comes the material which has been worked over into the\ndream? What causes the peculiarities which we observe in the dream\nthoughts, for example, that they may contradict one another? (The\nanalogy of the kettle, p. 87). Is the dream capable of teaching us\nsomething new about our inner psychic processes, and can its content\ncorrect opinions which we have held during the day? I suggest that for\nthe present all these questions be laid aside, and that a single path be\npursued. We have found that the dream represents a wish as fulfilled. It\nwill be our next interest to ascertain whether this is a universal\ncharacteristic of the dream, or only the accidental content of the dream\n(\u201cof Irma\u2019s injection\u201d) with which we have begun our analysis, for even\nif we make up our minds that every dream has a meaning and psychic\nvalue, we must nevertheless allow for the possibility that this meaning\nis not the same in every dream. The first dream we have considered was\nthe fulfilment of a wish; another may turn out to be a realised\napprehension; a third may have a reflection as to its content; a fourth\nmay simply reproduce a reminiscence. Are there then other wish dreams;\nor are there possibly nothing but wish dreams?\nIt is easy to show that the character of wish-fulfilment in dreams is\noften undisguised and recognisable, so that one may wonder why the\nlanguage of dreams has not long since been understood. There is, for\nexample, a dream which I can cause as often as I like, as it were\nexperimentally. If in the evening I eat anchovies, olives, or other\nstrongly salted foods, I become thirsty at night, whereupon I waken. The\nawakening, however, is preceded by a dream, which each time has the same\ncontent, namely, that I am drinking. I quaff water in long draughts, it\ntastes as sweet as only a cool drink can taste when one\u2019s throat is\nparched, and then I awake and have an actual desire to drink. The\noccasion for this dream is thirst, which I perceive when I awake. The\nwish to drink originates from this sensation, and the dream shows me\nthis wish as fulfilled. It thereby serves a function the nature of which\nI soon guess. I sleep well, and am not accustomed to be awakened by a\nbodily need. If I succeed in assuaging my thirst by means of the dream\nthat I am drinking, I need not wake up in order to satisfy it. It is\nthus a dream of convenience. The dream substitutes itself for action, as\nelsewhere in life. Unfortunately the need of water for quenching thirst\ncannot be satisfied with a dream, like my thirst for revenge upon Otto\nand Dr. M., but the intention is the same. This same dream recently\nappeared in modified form. On this occasion I became thirsty before\ngoing to bed, and emptied the glass of water which stood on the little\nchest next to my bed. Several hours later in the night came a new attack\nof thirst, accompanied by discomfort. In order to obtain water, I should\nhave had to get up and fetch the glass which stood on the night-chest of\nmy wife. I thus quite appropriately dreamt that my wife was giving me a\ndrink from a vase; this vase was an Etruscan cinerary urn which I had\nbrought home from an Italian journey and had since given away. But the\nwater in it tasted so salty (apparently from the ashes) that I had to\nwake. It may be seen how conveniently the dream is capable of arranging\nmatters; since the fulfilment of a wish is its only purpose, it may be\nperfectly egotistic. Love of comfort is really not compatible with\nconsideration for others. The introduction of the cinerary urn is\nprobably again the fulfilment of a wish; I am sorry that I no longer\npossess this vase; it, like the glass of water at my wife\u2019s side, is\ninaccessible to me. The cinerary urn is also appropriate to the\nsensation of a salty taste which has now grown stronger, and which I\nknow will force me to wake up.[Z]\nSuch convenience dreams were very frequent with me in the years of my\nyouth. Accustomed as I had always been to work until late at night,\nearly awakening was always a matter of difficulty for me. I used then to\ndream that I was out of bed and was standing at the wash-stand. After a\nwhile I could not make myself admit that I have not yet got up, but\nmeanwhile I had slept for a time. I am acquainted with the same dream of\nlaziness as dreamt by a young colleague of mine, who seems to share my\npropensity for sleep. The lodging-house keeper with whom he was living\nin the neighbourhood of the hospital had strict orders to wake him on\ntime every morning, but she certainly had a lot of trouble when she\ntried to carry out his orders. One morning sleep was particularly sweet.\nThe woman called into the room: \u201cMr. Joe, get up; you must go to the\nhospital.\u201d Whereupon the sleeper dreamt of a room in the hospital, a bed\nin which he was lying, and a chart pinned over his head reading: \u201cJoe\nH.... cand. med. 22 years old.\u201d He said to himself in the dream: \u201cIf I\nam already at the hospital, I don\u2019t have to go there,\u201d turned over and\nslept on. He had thus frankly admitted to himself his motive for\ndreaming.\nHere is another dream, the stimulus for which acts during sleep itself:\nOne of my women patients, who had had to undergo an unsuccessful\noperation on the jaw, was to wear a cooling apparatus on the affected\ncheek, according to the orders of the physicians. But she was in the\nhabit of throwing it off as soon as she had got to sleep. One day I was\nasked to reprove her for doing so; for she had again thrown the\napparatus on the floor. The patient defended herself as follows: \u201cThis\ntime I really couldn\u2019t help it; it was the result of a dream which I had\nin the night. In the dream, I was in a box at the opera and was taking a\nlively interest in the performance. But Mr. Karl Meyer was lying in the\nsanatorium and complaining pitifully on account of pains in his jaw. I\nsaid to myself, \u2018Since I haven\u2019t the pains, I don\u2019t need the apparatus\neither,\u2019 that\u2019s why I threw it away.\u201d This dream of the poor sufferer is\nsimilar to the idea in the expression which comes to our lips when we\nare in a disagreeable situation: \u201cI know something that\u2019s a great deal\nmore fun.\u201d The dream presents this great deal more fun. Mr. Karl Meyer,\nto whom the dreamer attributed her pains, was the most indifferent young\nman of her acquaintance whom she could recall.\nIt is no more difficult to discover the fulfilment of wishes in several\ndreams which I have collected from healthy persons. A friend who knew my\ntheory of dreams and had imparted it to his wife, said to me one day:\n\u201cMy wife asked me to tell you that she dreamt yesterday that she was\nhaving her menses. You will know what that means.\u201d Of course I know: if\nthe young wife dreams that she is having her menses, the menses have\nstopped. I can understand that she would have liked to enjoy her freedom\nfor a time longer before the discomforts of motherhood began. It was a\nclever way of giving notice of her first pregnancy. Another friend\nwrites that his wife had recently dreamt that she noticed milk stains on\nthe bosom of her waist. This is also an indication of pregnancy, but\nthis time not of the first one; the young mother wishes to have more\nnourishment for the second child than she had for the first.\nA young woman, who for weeks had been cut off from company because she\nwas nursing a child that was suffering from an infectious disease,\ndreams, after its safe termination, of a company of people in which A.\nDaudet, Bourget, M. Prevost, and others are present, all of whom are\nvery pleasant to her and entertain her admirably. The different authors\nin the dream also have the features which their pictures give them. M.\nPrevost, with whose picture she is not familiar, looks like\u2014the\ndisinfecting man who on the previous day had cleaned the sick rooms and\nhad entered them as the first visitor after a long period. Apparently\nthe dream might be perfectly translated thus: \u201cIt is about time now for\nsomething more entertaining than this eternal nursing.\u201d\nPerhaps this selection will suffice to prove that often and under the\nmost complex conditions dreams are found which can be understood only as\nfulfilments of wishes, and which present their contents without\nconcealment. In most cases these are short and simple dreams, which\nstand in pleasant contrast to the confused and teeming dream\ncompositions which have mainly attracted the attention of the authors.\nBut it will pay to spend some time upon these simple dreams. The most\nsimple dreams of all, I suppose, are to be expected in the case of\nchildren, whose psychic activities are certainly less complicated than\nthose of adults. The psychology of children, in my opinion, is to be\ncalled upon for services similar to those which a study of the anatomy\nand development of the lower animals renders to the investigation of the\nstructure of the highest classes of animals. Until now only a few\nconscious efforts have been made to take advantage of the psychology of\nchildren for such a purpose.\nThe dreams of little children are simple fulfilments of wishes, and as\ncompared, therefore, with the dreams of adults, are not at all\ninteresting. They present no problem to be solved, but are naturally\ninvaluable as affording proof that the dream in its essence signifies\nthe fulfilment of a wish. I have been able to collect several examples\nof such dreams from the material furnished by my own children.\nFor two dreams, one of my daughters, at that time eight and a half years\nold, the other of a boy five and a quarter years of age, I am indebted\nto an excursion to the beautiful Hallstatt in the summer of 1896. I must\nmake the preliminary statement that during this summer we were living on\na hill near Aussee, from which, when the weather was good, we enjoyed a\nsplendid view of the Dachstein from the roof of our house. The Simony\nHut could easily be recognised with a telescope. The little ones often\ntried to see it through the telescope\u2014I do not know with what success.\nBefore the excursion I had told the children that Hallstatt lay at the\nfoot of the Dachstein. They looked forward to the day with great joy.\nFrom Hallstatt we entered the valley of Eschern, which highly pleased\nthe children with its varying aspects. One of them, however, the boy of\nfive, gradually became discontented. As often as a mountain came in\nview, he would ask: \u201cIs that the Dachstein?\u201d whereupon I would have to\nanswer: \u201cNo, only a foot-hill.\u201d After this question had been repeated\nseveral times, he became altogether silent; and he was quite unwilling\nto come along on the flight of steps to the waterfall. I thought he was\ntired out. But the next morning, he approached me radiant with joy, and\nsaid: \u201cLast night I dreamt that we were at Simony Hut.\u201d I understood him\nnow; he had expected, as I was speaking of the Dachstein, that on the\nexcursion to Hallstatt, he would ascend the mountain and would come face\nto face with the hut, about which there had been so much discussion at\nthe telescope. When he learned that he was expected to be regaled with\nfoot-hills and a waterfall, he was disappointed and became discontented.\nThe dream compensated him for this. I tried to learn some details of the\ndream; they were scanty. \u201cSteps must be climbed for six hours,\u201d as he\nhad heard.\nOn this excursion wishes, destined to be satisfied only in dreams, had\narisen also in the mind of the girl of eight and a half years. We had\ntaken with us to Hallstatt the twelve-year-old boy of our neighbour\u2014an\naccomplished cavalier, who, it seems to me, already enjoyed the full\nsympathy of the little woman. The next morning, then, she related the\nfollowing dream: \u201cJust think, I dreamt that Emil was one of us, that he\nsaid papa and mamma to you, and slept at our house in the big room like\nour boys. Then mamma came into the room and threw a large handful of\nchocolate bars under our beds.\u201d The brothers of the girl, who evidently\nhad not inherited a familiarity with dream interpretation, declared just\nlike the authors: \u201cThat dream is nonsense.\u201d The girl defended at least a\npart of the dream, and it is worth while, from the point of view of the\ntheory of neuroses, to know which part: \u201cThat about Emil belonging to us\nis nonsense, but that about the bars of chocolate is not.\u201d It was just\nthis latter part that was obscure to me. For this mamma furnished me the\nexplanation. On the way home from the railway station the children had\nstopped in front of a slot machine, and had desired exactly such\nchocolate bars wrapped in paper with a metallic lustre, as the machine,\naccording to their experience, had for sale. But the mother had rightly\nthought that the day had brought enough wish-fulfilment, and had left\nthis wish to be satisfied in dreams. This little scene had escaped me. I\nat once understood that portion of the dream which had been condemned by\nmy daughter. I had myself heard the well-behaved guest enjoining the\nchildren to wait until papa or mamma had come up. For the little one the\ndream made a lasting adoption based on this temporary relation of the\nboy to us. Her tender nature was as yet unacquainted with any form of\nbeing together except those mentioned in the dream, which are taken from\nher brothers. Why the chocolate bars were thrown under the bed could\nnot, of course, be explained without questioning the child.\nFrom a friend I have learnt of a dream very similar to that of my boy.\nIt concerned an eight-year-old girl. The father had undertaken a walk to\nDornbach with the children, intending to visit the Rohrerh\u00fctte, but\nturned back because it had grown too late, and promised the children to\nmake up for their disappointment some other time. On the way back, they\npassed a sign which showed the way to the Hameau. The children now asked\nto be taken to that place also, but had to be content, for the same\nreason, with a postponement to another day. The next morning, the\neight-year-old girl came to the father, satisfied, saying: \u201cPapa, I\ndreamt last night that you were with us at the Rohrerh\u00fctte and on the\nHameau.\u201d Her impatience had thus in the dream anticipated the fulfilment\nof the promise made by her father.\nAnother dream, which the picturesque beauty of the Aussee inspired in my\ndaughter, at that time three and a quarter years old, is equally\nstraightforward. The little one had crossed the lake for the first time,\nand the trip had passed too quickly for her. She did not want to leave\nthe boat at the landing, and cried bitterly. The next morning she told\nus: \u201cLast night I was sailing on the lake.\u201d Let us hope that the\nduration of this dream ride was more satisfactory to her.\nMy eldest boy, at that time eight years of age, was already dreaming of\nthe realisation of his fancies. He had been riding in a chariot with\nAchilles, with Diomed as charioteer. He had, of course, on the previous\nday shown a lively interest in the _Myths of Greece_, which had been\ngiven to his elder sister.\nIf it be granted that the talking of children in sleep likewise belongs\nto the category of dreaming, I may report the following as one of the\nmost recent dreams in my collection. My youngest girl, at that time\nnineteen months old, had vomited one morning, and had therefore been\nkept without food throughout the day. During the night which followed\nupon this day of hunger, she was heard to call excitedly in her sleep:\n\u201cAnna Feud, strawberry, huckleberry, omelette, pap!\u201d She used her name\nin this way in order to express her idea of property; the menu must have\nincluded about everything which would seem to her a desirable meal; the\nfact that berries appeared in it twice was a demonstration against the\ndomestic sanitary regulations, and was based on the circumstance, by no\nmeans overlooked by her, that the nurse ascribed her indisposition to an\nover-plentiful consumption of strawberries; she thus in the dream took\nrevenge for this opinion which was distasteful to her.[AA]\nIf we call childhood happy because it does not yet know sexual desire,\nwe must not forget how abundant a source of disappointment and\nself-denial, and thus of dream stimulation, the other of the great\nlife-impulses may become for it.[AB] Here is a second example showing\nthis. My nephew of twenty-two months had been given the task of\ncongratulating me upon my birthday, and of handing me, as a present, a\nlittle basket of cherries, which at that time of the year were not yet\nin season. It seemed difficult for him, for he repeated again and again:\n\u201cCherries in it,\u201d and could not be induced to let the little basket go\nout of his hands. But he knew how to secure his compensation. He had,\nuntil now, been in the habit of telling his mother every morning that he\nhad dreamt of the \u201cwhite soldier,\u201d an officer of the guard in a white\ncloak, whom he had once admired on the street. On the day after the\nbirthday, he awakened joyfully with the information which could have had\nits origin only in a dream: \u201cHe(r)man eat up all the cherries!\u201d[AC]\nWhat animals dream of I do not know. A proverb for which I am indebted\nto one of my readers claims to know, for it raises the question: \u201cWhat\ndoes the goose dream of?\u201d the answer being: \u201cOf maize!\u201d The whole theory\nthat the dream is the fulfilment of a wish is contained in these\nsentences.[AD]\nWe now perceive that we should have reached our theory of the hidden\nmeaning of the dream by the shortest road if we had merely consulted\ncolloquial usage. The wisdom of proverbs, it is true, sometimes speaks\ncontemptuously enough of the dream\u2014it apparently tries to justify\nscience in expressing the opinion that \u201cDreams are mere bubbles;\u201d but\nstill for colloquial usage the dream is the gracious fulfiller of\nwishes. \u201cI should never have fancied that in the wildest dream,\u201d\nexclaims one who finds his expectations surpassed in reality.\nIV\nDISTORTION IN DREAMS\nIf I make the assertion that wish fulfilment is the meaning of every\ndream, that, accordingly, there can be no dreams except wish dreams, I\nam sure at the outset to meet with the most emphatic contradiction.\nObjections will be made to this effect: \u201cThe fact that there are dreams\nwhich must be understood as fulfilments of wishes is not new, but, on\nthe contrary, has long since been recognised by the authors. _Cf._\nRadestock[54] (pp. 137\u2013138), Volkelt[72] (pp. 110\u2013111), Tissi\u00e9[68] (p.\n70), M. Simon[63] (p. 42) on the hunger dreams of the imprisoned Baron\nTrenck, and the passage in Griesinger[31] (p. 11). The assumption that\nthere can be nothing but dreams of wish fulfilment, however, is another\nof those unjustified generalisations by which you have been pleased to\ndistinguish yourself of late. Indeed dreams which exhibit the most\npainful content, but not a trace of wish fulfilment, occur plentifully\nenough. The pessimistic philosopher, Edward von Hartman, perhaps stands\nfurthest from the theory of wish fulfilment. He expresses himself in his\n_Philosophy of the Unconscious_, Part II. (stereotyped edition, p. 34),\nto the following effect:\u2014\n\u201c\u2018As regards the dream, all the troubles of waking life are transferred\nby it to the sleeping state; only the one thing, which can in some\nmeasure reconcile a cultured person to life-scientific and artistic\nenjoyment is not transferred....\u2019 But even less discontented observers\nhave laid emphasis on the fact that in dreams pain and disgust are more\nfrequent than pleasure; so Scholz[59] (p. 39), Volkelt[72] (p. 80), and\nothers. Indeed two ladies, Sarah Weed and Florence Hallam,[33] have\nfound from the elaboration of their dreams a mathematical expression for\nthe preponderance of displeasure in dreams. They designate 58 per cent.\nof the dreams as disagreeable, and only 28\u00b76 per cent. as positively\npleasant. Besides those dreams which continue the painful sensations of\nlife during sleep, there are also dreams of fear, in which this most\nterrible of all disagreeable sensations tortures us until we awake, and\nit is with just these dreams of fear that children are so often\npersecuted (_Cf._ Debacker [17] concerning the Pavor Nocturnus), though\nit is in the case of children that you have found dreams of wishing\nundisguised.\u201d\nIndeed it is the anxiety dreams which seem to prevent a generalisation\nof the thesis that the dream is a wish-fulfilment, which we have\nestablished by means of the examples in the last section; they seem even\nto brand this thesis as an absurdity.\nIt is not difficult, however, to escape these apparently conclusive\nobjections. Please observe that our doctrine does not rest upon an\nacceptance of the manifest dream content, but has reference to the\nthought content which is found to lie behind the dream by the process of\ninterpretation. Let us contrast the _manifest_ and the _latent dream\ncontent_. It is true that there are dreams whose content is of the most\npainful nature. But has anyone ever tried to interpret these dreams, to\ndisclose their latent thought content? If not, the two objections are no\nlonger valid against us; there always remains the possibility that even\npainful and fearful dreams may be discovered to be wish fulfilments upon\ninterpretation.[AE]\nIn scientific work it is often advantageous, when the solution of one\nproblem presents difficulties, to take up a second problem, just as it\nis easier to crack two nuts together instead of separately. Accordingly\nwe are confronted not merely with the problem: How can painful and\nfearful dreams be the fulfilments of wishes? but we may also, from our\ndiscussion so far, raise the question: Why do not the dreams which show\nan indifferent content, but turn out to be wish-fulfilments, show this\nmeaning undisguised? Take the fully reported dream of Irma\u2019s injection;\nit is in no way painful in its nature, and can be recognised, upon\ninterpretation, as a striking wish-fulfilment. Why, in the first place,\nis an interpretation necessary? Why does not the dream say directly what\nit means? As a matter of fact, even the dream of Irma\u2019s injection does\nnot at first impress us as representing a wish of the dreamer as\nfulfilled. The reader will not have received this impression, and even I\nmyself did not know it until I had undertaken the analysis. If we call\nthis peculiarity of the dream of needing an explanation _the fact of the\ndistortion_ of dreams, then a second question arises: What is the origin\nof this disfigurement of dreams?\nIf one\u2019s first impressions on this subject were consulted, one might\nhappen upon several possible solutions; for example, that there is an\ninability during sleep to find an adequate expression for the dream\nthoughts. The analysis of certain dreams, however, compels us to give\nthe disfigurement of dreams another explanation. I shall show this by\nemploying a second dream of my own, which again involves numerous\nindiscretions, but which compensates for this personal sacrifice by\naffording a thorough elucidation of the problem.\n_Preliminary Statement._\u2014In the spring of 1897 I learnt that two\nprofessors of our university had proposed me for appointment as\nProfessor extraord. (assistant professor). This news reached me\nunexpectedly and pleased me considerably as an expression of\nappreciation on the part of two eminent men which could not be explained\nby personal interest. But, I immediately thought, I must not permit\nmyself to attach any expectation to this event. The university\ngovernment had during the last few years left proposals of this kind\nunconsidered, and several colleagues, who were ahead of me in years, and\nwho were at least my equals in merit, had been waiting in vain during\nthis time for their appointment. I had no reason to suppose I should\nfare better. I resolved then to comfort myself. I am not, so far as I\nknow, ambitious, and I engage in medical practice with satisfying\nresults even without the recommendation of a title. Moreover, it was not\na question whether I considered the grapes sweet or sour, for they\nundoubtedly hung much too high for me.\nOne evening I was visited by a friend of mine, one of those colleagues\nwhose fate I had taken as a warning for myself. As he had long been a\ncandidate for promotion to the position of professor, which in our\nsociety raises the physician to a demigod among his patients, and as he\nwas less resigned than I, he was in the habit of making representations\nfrom time to time, at the offices of the university government, for the\npurpose of advancing his interests. He came to me from a visit of that\nkind. He said that this time he had driven the exalted gentleman into a\ncorner, and had asked him directly whether considerations of creed were\nnot really responsible for the deferment of his appointment. The answer\nhad been that to be sure\u2014in the present state of public opinion\u2014His\nExcellency was not in a position, &c. \u201cNow I at least know what I am\nat,\u201d said my friend in closing his narrative, which told me nothing new,\nbut which was calculated to confirm me in my resignation. For the same\nconsiderations of creed applied to my own case.\nOn the morning after this visit, I had the following dream, which was\nnotable on account of its form. It consisted of two thoughts and two\nimages, so that a thought and an image alternated. But I here record\nonly the first half of the dream, because the other half has nothing to\ndo with the purpose which the citation of the dream should serve.\nI. _Friend R. is my uncle\u2014I feel great affection for him._\nII. _I see before me his face somewhat altered._\n_It seems to be elongated; a yellow beard, which surrounds it, is\nemphasised with peculiar distinctness._\nThen follow the other two portions, again a thought and an image, which\nI omit.\nThe interpretation of this dream was accomplished in the following\nmanner:\nAs the dream occurred to me in the course of the forenoon, I laughed\noutright and said: \u201cThe dream is nonsense.\u201d But I could not get it out\nof my mind, and the whole day it pursued me, until, at last, in the\nevening I reproached myself with the words: \u201cIf in the course of dream\ninterpretation one of your patients had nothing better to say than \u2018That\nis nonsense,\u2019 you would reprove him, and would suspect that behind the\ndream there was hidden some disagreeable affair, the exposure of which\nhe wanted to spare himself. Apply the same thing in your own case; your\nopinion that the dream is nonsense probably signifies merely an inner\nresistance to its interpretation. Do not let yourself be deterred.\u201d I\nthen proceeded to the interpretation.\n\u201cR. is my uncle.\u201d What does that mean. I have had only one uncle, my\nuncle Joseph.[AF] His story, to be sure, was a sad one. He had yielded\nto the temptation, more than thirty years before, of engaging in\ndealings which the law punishes severely, and which on that occasion\nalso it had visited with punishment. My father, who thereupon became\ngrey from grief in a few days, always used to say that Uncle Joseph was\nnever a wicked man, but that he was indeed a simpleton; so he expressed\nhimself. If, then, friend R. is my uncle Joseph, that is equivalent to\nsaying: \u201cR. is a simpleton.\u201d Hardly credible and very unpleasant! But\nthere is that face which I see in the dream, with its long features and\nits yellow beard. My uncle actually had such a face\u2014long and surrounded\nby a handsome blond beard. My friend R. was quite dark, but when\ndark-haired persons begin to grow grey, they pay for the glory of their\nyouthful years. Their black beard undergoes an unpleasant change of\ncolor, each hair separately; first it becomes reddish brown, then\nyellowish brown, and then at last definitely grey. The beard of my\nfriend R. is now in this stage, as is my own moreover, a fact which I\nnotice with regret. The face which I see in the dream is at once that of\nmy friend R. and that of my uncle. It is like a composite photograph of\nGalton, who, in order to emphasise family resemblances, had several\nfaces photographed on the same plate. No doubt is thus possible, I am\nreally of the opinion that my friend R. is a simpleton\u2014like my uncle\nJoseph.\nI have still no idea for what purpose I have constructed this\nrelationship, to which I must unconditionally object. But it is not a\nvery far-reaching one, for my uncle was a criminal, my friend R. is\ninnocent\u2014perhaps with the exception of having been punished for knocking\ndown an apprentice with his bicycle. Could I mean this offence? That\nwould be making ridiculous comparisons. Here I recollect another\nconversation which I had with another colleague, N., and indeed upon the\nsame subject. I met N. on the street. He likewise has been nominated for\na professorship, and having heard of my being honoured, congratulated me\nupon it. I declined emphatically, saying, \u201cYou are the last man to make\na joke like this, because you have experienced what the nomination is\nworth in your own case.\u201d Thereupon he said, though probably not in\nearnest, \u201cYou cannot be sure about that. Against me there is a very\nparticular objection. Don\u2019t you know that a woman once entered a legal\ncomplaint against me? I need not assure you that an inquiry was made; it\nwas a mean attempt at blackmail, and it was all I could do to save the\nplaintiff herself from punishment. But perhaps the affair will be\npressed against me at the office in order that I may not be appointed.\nYou, however, are above reproach.\u201d Here I have come upon a criminal, and\nat the same time upon the interpretation and trend of the dream. My\nuncle Joseph represents for me both colleagues who have not been\nappointed to the professorship, the one as a simpleton, the other as a\ncriminal. I also know now for what purpose I need this representation.\nIf considerations of creed are a determining factor in the postponement\nof the appointment of my friends, then my own appointment is also put in\nquestion: but if I can refer the rejection of the two friends to other\ncauses, which do not apply to my case, my hope remains undisturbed. This\nis the procedure of my dream; it makes the one, R., a simpleton, the\nother, N., a criminal; since, however, I am neither the one nor the\nother, our community of interest is destroyed, I have a right to enjoy\nthe expectation of being appointed a professor, and have escaped the\npainful application to my own case of the information which the high\nofficial has given to R.\nI must occupy myself still further with the interpretation of this\ndream. For my feelings it is not yet sufficiently cleared up. I am still\ndisquieted by the ease with which I degrade two respected colleagues for\nthe purpose of clearing the way to the professorship for myself. My\ndissatisfaction with my procedure has indeed diminished since I have\nlearnt to evaluate statements made in dreams. I would argue against\nanyone who urged that I really consider R. a simpleton, and that I do\nnot credit N.\u2019s account of the blackmail affair. I do not believe either\nthat Irma has been made seriously ill by an injection given her by Otto\nwith a preparation of propyl. Here, as before, it is only the _wish that\nthe case may be as the dream expresses it_. The statement in which my\nwish is realised sounds less absurd in the second dream than in the\nfirst; it is made here with a more skilful utilisation of facts as\npoints of attachment, something like a well-constructed slander, where\n\u201cthere is something in it.\u201d For my friend R. had at that time the vote\nof a professor from the department against him, and my friend N. had\nhimself unsuspectingly furnished me with the material for slander.\nNevertheless, I repeat, the dream seems to me to require further\nelucidation.\nI remember now that the dream contains still another portion which so\nfar our interpretation has not taken into account. After it occurs to me\nthat my friend R. is my uncle, I feel great affection for him. To whom\ndoes this feeling belong? For my uncle Joseph, of course, I have never\nhad any feelings of affection. For years my friend R. has been beloved\nand dear to me; but if I were to go to him and express my feelings for\nhim in terms which came anywhere near corresponding to the degree of\naffection in the dream, he would doubtless be surprised. My affection\nfor him seems untrue and exaggerated, something like my opinion of his\npsychic qualities, which I express by fusing his personality with that\nof my uncle; but it is exaggerated in an opposite sense. But now a new\nstate of affairs becomes evident to me. The affection in the dream does\nnot belong to the hidden content, to the thoughts behind the dream; it\nstands in opposition to this content; it is calculated to hide the\ninformation which interpretation may bring. Probably this is its very\npurpose. I recall with what resistance I applied myself to the work of\ninterpretation, how long I tried to postpone it, and how I declared the\ndream to be sheer nonsense. I know from my psychoanalytical treatments\nhow such condemnation is to be interpreted. It has no value as affording\ninformation, but only as the registration of an affect. If my little\ndaughter does not like an apple which is offered her, she asserts that\nthe apple has a bitter taste, without even having tasted it. If my\npatients act like the little girl, I know that it is a question of a\nnotion which they want to _suppress_. The same applies to my dream. I do\nnot want to interpret it because it contains something to which I\nobject. After the interpretation of the dream has been completed, I find\nout what it was I objected to; it was the assertion that R. is a\nsimpleton. I may refer the affection which I feel for R. not to the\nhidden dream thoughts, but rather to this unwillingness of mine. If my\ndream as compared with its hidden content is disfigured at this point,\nand is disfigured, moreover, into something opposite, then the apparent\naffection in the dream serves the purpose of disfigurement; or, in other\nwords, the disfigurement is here shown to be intended: it is a means of\ndissimulation. My dream thoughts contain an unfavourable reference to\nR.; in order that I may not become aware of it, its opposite, a feeling\nof affection for him, makes its way into the dream.\nThe fact here recognised might be of universal applicability. As the\nexamples in Section III. have shown, there are dreams which are\nundisguised wish-fulfilments. Wherever a wish-fulfilment is\nunrecognisable and concealed, there must be present a feeling of\nrepulsion towards this wish, and in consequence of this repulsion the\nwish is unable to gain expression except in a disfigured state. I shall\ntry to find a case in social life which is parallel to this occurrence\nin the inner psychic life. Where in social life can a similar\ndisfigurement of a psychic act be found? Only where two persons are in\nquestion, one of whom possesses a certain power, while the other must\nhave a certain consideration for this power. This second person will\nthen disfigure his psychic actions, or, as we may say, he will\ndissimulate. The politeness which I practise every day is largely\ndissimulation of this kind. If I interpret my dreams for the benefit of\nthe reader I am forced to make such distortions. The poet also complains\nabout such disfigurement:\n\u201cYou may not tell the best that you know to the youngsters.\u201d\nThe political writer who has unpleasant truths to tell to the government\nfinds himself in the same position. If he tells them without reserve,\nthe government will suppress them\u2014subsequently in case of a verbal\nexpression of opinion, preventatively, if they are to be published in\nprint. The writer must fear _censure_; he therefore modifies and\ndisfigures the expression of his opinion. He finds himself compelled,\naccording to the sensitiveness of this censure, either to restrain\nhimself from certain particular forms of attack or to speak in allusion\ninstead of direct designations. Or he must disguise his objectionable\nstatement in a garb that seems harmless. He may, for instance, tell of\nan occurrence between two mandarins in the Orient, while he has the\nofficials of his own country in view. The stricter the domination of the\ncensor, the more extensive becomes the disguise, and often the more\nhumorous the means employed to put the reader back on the track of the\nreal meaning.\nThe correspondence between the phenomena of the censor and those of\ndream distortion, which may be traced in detail, justifies us in\nassuming similar conditions for both. We should then assume in each\nhuman being, as the primary cause of dream formation, two psychic forces\n(streams, systems), of which one constitutes the wish expressed by the\ndream, while the other acts as a censor upon this dream wish, and by\nmeans of this censoring forces a distortion of its expression. The only\nquestion is as to the basis of the authority of this second instance[AG]\nby virtue of which it may exercise its censorship. If we remember that\nthe hidden dream thoughts are not conscious before analysis, but that\nthe apparent dream content is remembered as conscious, we easily reach\nthe assumption that admittance to consciousness is the privilege of the\nsecond instance. Nothing can reach consciousness from the first system\nwhich has not first passed the second instance, and the second instance\nlets nothing pass without exercising its rights and forcing such\nalterations upon the candidate for admission to consciousness as are\npleasant to itself. We are here forming a very definite conception of\nthe \u201cessence\u201d of consciousness; for us the state of becoming conscious\nis a particular psychic act, different from and independent of becoming\nfixed or of being conceived, and consciousness appears to us as an organ\nof sense, which perceives a content presented from another source. It\nmay be shown that psychopathology cannot possibly dispense with these\nfundamental assumptions. We may reserve a more thorough examination of\nthese for a later time.\nIf I keep in mind the idea of the two psychic instances and their\nrelations to consciousness, I find in the sphere of politics a very\nexact analogy for the extraordinary affection which I feel for my friend\nR., who suffers such degradation in the course of the dream\ninterpretation. I turn my attention to a political state in which a\nruler, jealous of his rights, and a live public opinion are in conflict\nwith each other. The people are indignant against an official whom they\nhate, and demand his dismissal; and in order not to show that he is\ncompelled to respect the public wish, the autocrat will expressly confer\nupon the official some great honour, for which there would otherwise\nhave been no occasion. Thus the second instance referred to, which\ncontrols access to consciousness, honours my friend R. with a profusion\nof extraordinary tenderness, because the wish activities of the first\nsystem, in accordance with a particular interest which they happen to be\npursuing, are inclined to put him down as a simpleton.[AH]\nPerhaps we shall now begin to suspect that dream interpretation is\ncapable of giving us hints about the structure of our psychic apparatus\nwhich we have thus far expected in vain from philosophy. We shall not,\nhowever, follow this track, but return to our original problem as soon\nas we have cleared up the subject of dream-disfigurement. The question\nhas arisen how dreams with disagreeable content can be analysed as the\nfulfilments of wishes. We see now that this is possible in case\ndream-disfigurement has taken place, in case the disagreeable content\nserves only as a disguise for what is wished. Keeping in mind our\nassumptions in regard to the two psychic instances, we may now proceed\nto say: disagreeable dreams, as a matter of fact, contain something\nwhich is disagreeable to the second instance, but which at the same time\nfulfils a wish of the first instance. They are wish dreams in the sense\nthat every dream originates in the first instance, while the second\ninstance acts towards the dream only in a repelling, not in a creative\nmanner. If we limit ourselves to a consideration of what the second\ninstance contributes to the dream, we can never understand the dream. If\nwe do so, all the riddles which the authors have found in the dream\nremain unsolved.\nThat the dream actually has a secret meaning, which turns out to be the\nfulfilment of a wish, must be proved afresh for every case by means of\nan analysis. I therefore select several dreams which have painful\ncontents and attempt an analysis of them. They are partly dreams of\nhysterical subjects, which require long preliminary statements, and now\nand then also an examination of the psychic processes which occur in\nhysteria. I cannot, however, avoid this added difficulty in the\nexposition.\nWhen I give a psychoneurotic patient analytical treatment, dreams are\nalways, as I have said, the subject of our discussion. It must,\ntherefore, give him all the psychological explanations through whose aid\nI myself have come to an understanding of his symptoms, and here I\nundergo an unsparing criticism, which is perhaps not less keen than that\nI must expect from my colleagues. Contradiction of the thesis that all\ndreams are the fulfilments of wishes is raised by my patients with\nperfect regularity. Here are several examples of the dream material\nwhich is offered me to refute this position.\n\u201cYou always tell me that the dream is a wish fulfilled,\u201d begins a clever\nlady patient. \u201cNow I shall tell you a dream in which the content is\nquite the opposite, in which a wish of mine is _not_ fulfilled. How do\nyou reconcile that with your theory? The dream is as follows:\u2014\n\u201c_I want to give a supper, but having nothing at hand except some smoked\nsalmon, I think of going marketing, but I remember that it is Sunday\nafternoon, when all the shops are closed. I next try to telephone to\nsome caterers, but the telephone is out of order. Thus I must resign my\nwish to give a supper._\u201d\nI answer, of course, that only the analysis can decide the meaning of\nthis dream, although I admit that at first sight it seems sensible and\ncoherent, and looks like the opposite of a wish-fulfilment. \u201cBut what\noccurrence has given rise to this dream?\u201d I ask. \u201cYou know that the\nstimulus for a dream always lies among the experiences of the preceding\nday.\u201d\n_Analysis._\u2014The husband of the patient, an upright and conscientious\nwholesale butcher, had told her the day before that he is growing too\nfat, and that he must, therefore, begin treatment for obesity. He was\ngoing to get up early, take exercise, keep to a strict diet, and above\nall accept no more invitations to suppers. She proceeds laughingly to\nrelate how her husband at an inn table had made the acquaintance of an\nartist, who insisted upon painting his portrait because he, the painter,\nhad never found such an expressive head. But her husband had answered in\nhis rough way, that he was very thankful for the honour, but that he was\nquite convinced that a portion of the backside of a pretty young girl\nwould please the artist better than his whole face.[AI] She said that\nshe was at the time very much in love with her husband, and teased him a\ngood deal. She had also asked him not to send her any caviare. What does\nthat mean?\nAs a matter of fact, she had wanted for a long time to eat a caviare\nsandwich every forenoon, but had grudged herself the expense. Of course,\nshe would at once get the caviare from her husband, as soon as she asked\nhim for it. But she had begged him, on the contrary, not to send her the\ncaviare, in order that she might tease him about it longer.\nThis explanation seems far-fetched to me. Unadmitted motives are in the\nhabit of hiding behind such unsatisfactory explanations. We are reminded\nof subjects hypnotised by Bernheim, who carried out a posthypnotic\norder, and who, upon being asked for their motives, instead of\nanswering: \u201cI do not know why I did that,\u201d had to invent a reason that\nwas obviously inadequate. Something similar is probably the case with\nthe caviare of my patient. I see that she is compelled to create an\nunfulfilled wish in life. Her dream also shows the reproduction of the\nwish as accomplished. But why does she need an unfulfilled wish?\nThe ideas so far produced are insufficient for the interpretation of the\ndream. I beg for more. After a short pause, which corresponds to the\novercoming of a resistance, she reports further that the day before she\nhad made a visit to a friend, of whom she is really jealous, because her\nhusband is always praising this woman so much. Fortunately, this friend\nis very lean and thin, and her husband likes well-rounded figures. Now\nof what did this lean friend speak? Naturally of her wish to become\nsomewhat stouter. She also asked my patient: \u201cWhen are you going to\ninvite us again? You always have such a good table.\u201d\nNow the meaning of the dream is clear. I may say to the patient: \u201cIt is\njust as though you had thought at the time of the request: \u2018Of course,\nI\u2019ll invite you, so you can eat yourself fat at my house and become\nstill more pleasing to my husband. I would rather give no more suppers.\u2019\nThe dream then tells you that you cannot give a supper, thereby\nfulfilling your wish not to contribute anything to the rounding out of\nyour friend\u2019s figure. The resolution of your husband to refuse\ninvitations to supper for the sake of getting thin teaches you that one\ngrows fat on the things served in company.\u201d Now only some conversation\nis necessary to confirm the solution. The smoked salmon in the dream has\nnot yet been traced. \u201cHow did the salmon mentioned in the dream occur to\nyou?\u201d \u201cSmoked salmon is the favourite dish of this friend,\u201d she\nanswered. I happen to know the lady, and may corroborate this by saying\nthat she grudges herself the salmon just as much as my patient grudges\nherself the caviare.\nThe dream admits of still another and more exact interpretation, which\nis necessitated only by a subordinate circumstance. The two\ninterpretations do not contradict one another, but rather cover each\nother and furnish a neat example of the usual ambiguity of dreams as\nwell as of all other psychopathological formations. We have seen that at\nthe same time that she dreams of the denial of the wish, the patient is\nin reality occupied in securing an unfulfilled wish (the caviare\nsandwiches). Her friend, too, had expressed a wish, namely, to get\nfatter, and it would not surprise us if our lady had dreamt that the\nwish of the friend was not being fulfilled. For it is her own wish that\na wish of her friend\u2019s\u2014for increase in weight\u2014should not be fulfilled.\nInstead of this, however, she dreams that one of her own wishes is not\nfulfilled. The dream becomes capable of a new interpretation, if in the\ndream she does not intend herself, but her friend, if she has put\nherself in the place of her friend, or, as we may say, has identified\nherself with her friend.\nI think she has actually done this, and as a sign of this identification\nshe has created an unfulfilled wish in reality. But what is the meaning\nof this hysterical identification? To clear this up a thorough\nexposition is necessary. Identification is a highly important factor in\nthe mechanism of hysterical symptoms; by this means patients are enabled\nin their symptoms to represent not merely their own experiences, but the\nexperiences of a great number of other persons, and can suffer, as it\nwere, for a whole mass of people, and fill all the parts of a drama by\nmeans of their own personalities alone. It will here be objected that\nthis is well-known hysterical imitation, the ability of hysteric\nsubjects to copy all the symptoms which impress them when they occur in\nothers, as though their pity were stimulated to the point of\nreproduction. But this only indicates the way in which the psychic\nprocess is discharged in hysterical imitation; the way in which a\npsychic act proceeds and the act itself are two different things. The\nlatter is slightly more complicated than one is apt to imagine the\nimitation of hysterical subjects to be: it corresponds to an unconscious\nconcluded process, as an example will show. The physician who has a\nfemale patient with a particular kind of twitching, lodged in the\ncompany of other patients in the same room of the hospital, is not\nsurprised when some morning he learns that this peculiar hysterical\nattack has found imitations. He simply says to himself: The others have\nseen her and have done likewise: that is psychic infection. Yes, but\npsychic infection proceeds in somewhat the following manner: As a rule,\npatients know more about one another than the physician knows about each\nof them, and they are concerned about each other when the visit of the\ndoctor is over. Some of them have an attack to-day: soon it is known\namong the rest that a letter from home, a return of love-sickness or the\nlike, is the cause of it. Their sympathy is aroused, and the following\nsyllogism, which does not reach consciousness, is completed in them: \u201cIf\nit is possible to have this kind of an attack from such causes, I too\nmay have this kind of an attack, for I have the same reasons.\u201d If this\nwere a cycle capable of becoming conscious, it would perhaps express\nitself in _fear_ of getting the same attack; but it takes place in\nanother psychic sphere, and, therefore, ends in the realisation of the\ndreaded symptom. Identification is therefore not a simple imitation, but\na sympathy based upon the same etiological claim; it expresses an \u201cas\nthough,\u201d and refers to some common quality which has remained in the\nunconscious.\nIdentification is most often used in hysteria to express sexual\ncommunity. An hysterical woman identifies herself most readily\u2014although\nnot exclusively\u2014with persons with whom she has had sexual relations, or\nwho have sexual intercourse with the same persons as herself. Language\ntakes such a conception into consideration: two lovers are \u201cone.\u201d In the\nhysterical phantasy, as well as in the dream, it is sufficient for the\nidentification if one thinks of sexual relations, whether or not they\nbecome real. The patient, then, only follows the rules of the hysterical\nthought processes when she gives expression to her jealousy of her\nfriend (which, moreover, she herself admits to be unjustified, in that\nshe puts herself in her place and identifies herself with her by\ncreating a symptom\u2014the denied wish). I might further clarify the process\nspecifically as follows: She puts herself in the place of her friend in\nthe dream, because her friend has taken her own place in relation to her\nhusband, and because she would like to take her friend\u2019s place in the\nesteem of her husband.[AJ]\nThe contradiction to my theory of dreams in the case of another female\npatient, the most witty among all my dreamers, was solved in a simpler\nmanner, although according to the scheme that the non-fulfilment of one\nwish signifies the fulfilment of another. I had one day explained to her\nthat the dream is a wish-fulfilment. The next day she brought me a dream\nto the effect that she was travelling with her mother-inlaw to their\ncommon summer resort. Now I knew that she had struggled violently\nagainst spending the summer in the neighbourhood of her mother-in-law. I\nalso knew that she had luckily avoided her mother-in-law by renting an\nestate in a far-distant country resort. Now the dream reversed this\nwished-for solution; was not this in the flattest contradiction to my\ntheory of wish-fulfilment in the dream? Certainly, it was only necessary\nto draw the inferences from this dream in order to get at its\ninterpretation. According to this dream, I was in the wrong. _It was\nthus her wish that I should be in the wrong, and this wish the dream\nshowed her as fulfilled._ But the wish that I should be in the wrong,\nwhich was fulfilled in the theme of the country home, referred to a more\nserious matter. At that time I had made up my mind, from the material\nfurnished by her analysis, that something of significance for her\nillness must have occurred at a certain time in her life. She had denied\nit because it was not present in her memory. We soon came to see that I\nwas in the right. Her wish that I should be in the wrong, which is\ntransformed into the dream, thus corresponded to the justifiable wish\nthat those things, which at the time had only been suspected, had never\noccurred at all.\nWithout an analysis, and merely by means of an assumption, I took the\nliberty of interpreting a little occurrence in the case of a friend, who\nhad been my colleague through the eight classes of the Gymnasium. He\nonce heard a lecture of mine delivered to a small assemblage, on the\nnovel subject of the dream as the fulfilment of a wish. He went home,\ndreamt _that he had lost all his suits_\u2014he was a lawyer\u2014and then\ncomplained to me about it. I took refuge in the evasion: \u201cOne can\u2019t win\nall one\u2019s suits,\u201d but I thought to myself: \u201cIf for eight years I sat as\nPrimus on the first bench, while he moved around somewhere in the middle\nof the class, may he not naturally have had a wish from his boyhood days\nthat I, too, might for once completely disgrace myself?\u201d\nIn the same way another dream of a more gloomy character was offered me\nby a female patient as a contradiction to my theory of the wish-dream.\nThe patient, a young girl, began as follows: \u201cYou remember that my\nsister has now only one boy, Charles: she lost the elder one, Otto,\nwhile I was still at her house. Otto was my favourite; it was I who\nreally brought him up. I like the other little fellow, too, but of\ncourse not nearly as much as the dead one. Now I dreamt last night that\n_I saw Charles lying dead before me_. _He was lying in his little\ncoffin, his hands folded: there were candles all about, and, in short,\nit was just like the time of little Otto\u2019s death, which shocked me so\nprofoundly._ Now tell me, what does this mean? You know me: am I really\nbad enough to wish my sister to lose the only child she has left? Or\ndoes the dream mean that I wish Charles to be dead rather than Otto,\nwhom I like so much better?\u201d\nI assured her that this interpretation was impossible. After some\nreflection I was able to give her the interpretation of the dream, which\nI subsequently made her confirm.\nHaving become an orphan at an early age, the girl had been brought up in\nthe house of a much older sister, and had met among the friends and\nvisitors who came to the house, a man who made a lasting impression upon\nher heart. It looked for a time as though these barely expressed\nrelations were to end in marriage, but this happy culmination was\nfrustrated by the sister, whose motives have never found a complete\nexplanation. After the break, the man who was loved by our patient\navoided the house: she herself became independent some time after little\nOtto\u2019s death, to whom her affection had now turned. But she did not\nsucceed in freeing herself from the inclination for her sister\u2019s friend\nin which she had become involved. Her pride commanded her to avoid him;\nbut it was impossible for her to transfer her love to the other suitors\nwho presented themselves in order. Whenever the man whom she loved, who\nwas a member of the literary profession, announced a lecture anywhere,\nshe was sure to be found in the audience; she also seized every other\nopportunity to see him from a distance unobserved by him. I remembered\nthat on the day before she had told me that the Professor was going to a\ncertain concert, and that she was also going there, in order to enjoy\nthe sight of him. This was on the day of the dream; and the concert was\nto take place on the day on which she told me the dream. I could now\neasily see the correct interpretation, and I asked her whether she could\nthink of any event which had happened after the death of little Otto.\nShe answered immediately: \u201cCertainly; at that time the Professor\nreturned after a long absence, and I saw him once more beside the coffin\nof little Otto.\u201d It was exactly as I had expected. I interpreted the\ndream in the following manner: If now the other boy were to die, the\nsame thing would be repeated. You would spend the day with your sister,\nthe Professor would surely come in order to offer condolence, and you\nwould see him again under the same circumstances as at that time. The\ndream signifies nothing but this wish of yours to see him again, against\nwhich you are fighting inwardly. I know that you are carrying the ticket\nfor to-day\u2019s concert in your bag. Your dream is a dream of impatience;\nit has anticipated the meeting which is to take place to-day by several\nhours.\nIn order to disguise her wish she had obviously selected a situation in\nwhich wishes of that sort are commonly suppressed\u2014a situation which is\nso filled with sorrow that love is not thought of. And yet, it is very\neasily probable that even in the actual situation at the bier of the\nsecond, more dearly loved boy, which the dream copied faithfully, she\nhad not been able to suppress her feelings of affection for the visitor\nwhom she had missed for so long a time.\nA different explanation was found in the case of a similar dream of\nanother female patient, who was distinguished in her earlier years by\nher quick wit and her cheerful demeanour, and who still showed these\nqualities at least in the notions which occurred to her in the course of\ntreatment. In connection with a longer dream, it seemed to this lady\nthat she saw her fifteen-year-old daughter lying dead before her in a\nbox. She was strongly inclined to convert this dream-image into an\nobjection to the theory of wish-fulfilment, but herself suspected that\nthe detail of the box must lead to a different conception of the\ndream.[AK] In the course of the analysis it occurred to her that on the\nevening before, the conversation of the company had turned upon the\nEnglish word \u201cbox,\u201d and upon the numerous translations of it into\nGerman, such as box, theatre box, chest, box on the ear, &c. From other\ncomponents of the same dream it is now possible to add that the lady had\nguessed the relationship between the English word \u201cbox\u201d and the German\n_B\u00fcchse_, and had then been haunted by the memory that _B\u00fcchse_ (as well\nas \u201cbox\u201d) is used in vulgar speech to designate the female genital\norgan. It was therefore possible, making a certain allowance for her\nnotions on the subject of topographical anatomy, to assume that the\nchild in the box signified a child in the womb of the mother. At this\nstage of the explanation she no longer denied that the picture of the\ndream really corresponded to one of her wishes. Like so many other young\nwomen, she was by no means happy when she became pregnant, and admitted\nto me more than once the wish that her child might die before its birth;\nin a fit of anger following a violent scene with her husband she had\neven struck her abdomen with her fists in order to hit the child within.\nThe dead child was, therefore, really the fulfilment of a wish, but a\nwish which had been put aside for fifteen years, and it is not\nsurprising that the fulfilment of the wish was no longer recognised\nafter so long an interval. For there had been many changes meanwhile.\nThe group of dreams to which the two last mentioned belong, having as\ncontent the death of beloved relatives, will be considered again under\nthe head of \u201cTypical Dreams.\u201d I shall there be able to show by new\nexamples that in spite of their undesirable content, all these dreams\nmust be interpreted as wish-fulfilments. For the following dream, which\nagain was told me in order to deter me from a hasty generalisation of\nthe theory of wishing in dreams, I am indebted, not to a patient, but to\nan intelligent jurist of my acquaintance. \u201c_I dream_,\u201d my informant\ntells me, \u201c_that I am walking in front of my house with a lady on my\narm_. _Here a closed wagon is waiting, a gentleman steps up to me, gives\nhis authority as an agent of the police, and demands that I should\nfollow him. I only ask for time in which to arrange my affairs._ Can you\npossibly suppose this is a wish of mine to be arrested?\u201d \u201cOf course\nnot,\u201d I must admit. \u201cDo you happen to know upon what charge you were\narrested?\u201d \u201cYes; I believe for infanticide.\u201d \u201cInfanticide? But you know\nthat only a mother can commit this crime upon her newly born child?\u201d\n\u201cThat is true.\u201d[AL] \u201cAnd under what circumstances did you dream; what\nhappened on the evening before?\u201d \u201cI would rather not tell you that; it\nis a delicate matter.\u201d \u201cBut I must have it, otherwise we must forgo the\ninterpretation of the dream.\u201d \u201cWell, then, I will tell you. I spent the\nnight, not at home, but at the house of a lady who means very much to\nme. When we awoke in the morning, something again passed between us.\nThen I went to sleep again, and dreamt what I have told you.\u201d \u201cThe woman\nis married?\u201d \u201cYes.\u201d \u201cAnd you do not wish her to conceive a child?\u201d \u201cNo;\nthat might betray us.\u201d \u201cThen you do not practise normal coitus?\u201d \u201cI take\nthe precaution to withdraw before ejaculation.\u201d \u201cAm I permitted to\nassume that you did this trick several times during the night, and that\nin the morning you were not quite sure whether you had succeeded?\u201d \u201cThat\nmight be the case.\u201d \u201cThen your dream is the fulfilment of a wish. By\nmeans of it you secure the assurance that you have not begotten a child,\nor, what amounts to the same thing, that you have killed a child. I can\neasily demonstrate the connecting links. Do you remember, a few days ago\nwe were talking about the distress of matrimony (Ehenot), and about the\ninconsistency of permitting the practice of coitus as long as no\nimpregnation takes place, while every delinquency after the ovum and the\nsemen meet and a f\u0153tus is formed is punished as a crime? In connection\nwith this, we also recalled the medi\u00e6val controversy about the moment of\ntime at which the soul is really lodged in the f\u0153tus, since the concept\nof murder becomes admissible only from that point on. Doubtless you also\nknow the gruesome poem by Lenau, which puts infanticide and the\nprevention of children on the same plane.\u201d \u201cStrangely enough, I had\nhappened to think of Lenau during the afternoon.\u201d \u201cAnother echo of your\ndream. And now I shall demonstrate to you another subordinate\nwish-fulfilment in your dream. You walk in front of your house with the\nlady on your arm. So you take her home, instead of spending the night at\nher house, as you do in actuality. The fact that the wish-fulfilment,\nwhich is the essence of the dream, disguises itself in such an\nunpleasant form, has perhaps more than one reason. From my essay on the\netiology of anxiety neuroses, you will see that I note interrupted\ncoitus as one of the factors which cause the development of neurotic\nfear. It would be consistent with this that if after repeated\ncohabitation of the kind mentioned you should be left in an\nuncomfortable mood, which now becomes an element in the composition of\nyour dream. You also make use of this unpleasant state of mind to\nconceal the wish-fulfilment. Furthermore, the mention of infanticide has\nnot yet been explained. Why does this crime, which is peculiar to\nfemales, occur to you?\u201d \u201cI shall confess to you that I was involved in\nsuch an affair years ago. Through my fault a girl tried to protect\nherself from the consequences of a _liaison_ with me by securing an\nabortion. I had nothing to do with carrying out the plan, but I was\nnaturally for a long time worried lest the affair might be discovered.\u201d\n\u201cI understand; this recollection furnished a second reason why the\nsupposition that you had done your trick badly must have been painful to\nyou.\u201d\nA young physician, who had heard this dream of my colleague when it was\ntold, must have felt implicated by it, for he hastened to imitate it in\na dream of his own, applying its mode of thinking to another subject.\nThe day before he had handed in a declaration of his income, which was\nperfectly honest, because he had little to declare. He dreamt that an\nacquaintance of his came from a meeting of the tax commission and\ninformed him that all the other declarations of income had passed\nuncontested, but that his own had awakened general suspicion, and that\nhe would be punished with a heavy fine. The dream is a poorly-concealed\nfulfilment of the wish to be known as a physician with a large income.\nIt likewise recalls the story of the young girl who was advised against\naccepting her suitor because he was a man of quick temper who would\nsurely treat her to blows after they were married. The answer of the\ngirl was: \u201cI wish he _would_ strike me!\u201d Her wish to be married is so\nstrong that she takes into the bargain the discomfort which is said to\nbe connected with matrimony, and which is predicted for her, and even\nraises it to a wish.\nIf I group the very frequently occurring dreams of this sort, which seem\nflatly to contradict my theory, in that they contain the denial of a\nwish or some occurrence decidedly unwished for, under the head of\n\u201ccounter wish-dreams,\u201d I observe that they may all be referred to two\nprinciples, of which one has not yet been mentioned, although it plays a\nlarge part in the dreams of human beings. One of the motives inspiring\nthese dreams is the wish that I should appear in the wrong. These dreams\nregularly occur in the course of my treatment if the patient shows a\nresistance against me, and I can count with a large degree of certainty\nupon causing such a dream after I have once explained to the patient my\ntheory that the dream is a wish-fulfilment.[AM] I may even expect this\nto be the case in a dream merely in order to fulfil the wish that I may\nappear in the wrong. The last dream which I shall tell from those\noccurring in the course of treatment again shows this very thing. A\nyoung girl who has struggled hard to continue my treatment, against the\nwill of her relatives and the authorities whom she has consulted, dreams\nas follows: _She is forbidden at home to come to me any more. She then\nreminds me of the promise I made her to treat her for nothing if\nnecessary, and I say to her: \u201cI can show no consideration in money\nmatters.\u201d_\nIt is not at all easy in this case to demonstrate the fulfilment of a\nwish, but in all cases of this kind there is a second problem, the\nsolution of which helps also to solve the first. Where does she get the\nwords which she puts into my mouth? Of course I have never told her\nanything like that, but one of her brothers, the very one who has the\ngreatest influence over her, has been kind enough to make this remark\nabout me. It is then the purpose of the dream that this brother should\nremain in the right; and she does not try to justify this brother merely\nin the dream; it is her purpose in life and the motive for her being\nill.\nThe other motive for counter wish-dreams is so clear that there is\ndanger of overlooking it, as for some time happened in my own case. In\nthe sexual make-up of many people there is a masochistic component,\nwhich has arisen through the conversion of the aggressive, sadistic\ncomponent into its opposite. Such people are called \u201cideal\u201d masochists,\nif they seek pleasure not in the bodily pain which may be inflicted upon\nthem, but in humiliation and in chastisement of the soul. It is obvious\nthat such persons can have counter wish-dreams and disagreeable dreams,\nwhich, however, for them are nothing but wish-fulfilments, affording\nsatisfaction for their masochistic inclinations. Here is such a dream. A\nyoung man, who has in earlier years tormented his elder brother, towards\nwhom he was homosexually inclined, but who has undergone a complete\nchange of character, has the following dream, which consists of three\nparts: (1) _He is \u201cinsulted\u201d by his brother._ (2) _Two adults are\ncaressing each other with homosexual intentions._ (3) _His brother has\nsold the enterprise whose management the young man reserved for his own\nfuture._ He awakens from the last-mentioned dream with the most\nunpleasant feelings, and yet it is a masochistic wish-dream, which might\nbe translated: It would serve me quite right if my brother were to make\nthat sale against my interest, as a punishment for all the torments\nwhich he has suffered at my hands.\nI hope that the above discussion and examples will suffice\u2014until further\nobjection can be raised\u2014to make it seem credible that even dreams with a\npainful content are to be analysed as the fulfilments of wishes. Nor\nwill it seem a matter of chance that in the course of interpretation one\nalways happens upon subjects of which one does not like to speak or\nthink. The disagreeable sensation which such dreams arouse is simply\nidentical with the antipathy which endeavours\u2014usually with success\u2014to\nrestrain us from the treatment or discussion of such subjects, and which\nmust be overcome by all of us, if, in spite of its unpleasantness, we\nfind it necessary to take the matter in hand. But this disagreeable\nsensation, which occurs also in dreams, does not preclude the existence\nof a wish; everyone has wishes which he would not like to tell to\nothers, which he does not want to admit even to himself. We are, on\nother grounds, justified in connecting the disagreeable character of all\nthese dreams with the fact of dream disfigurement, and in concluding\nthat these dreams are distorted, and that the wish-fulfilment in them is\ndisguised until recognition is impossible for no other reason than that\na repugnance, a will to suppress, exists in relation to the\nsubject-matter of the dream or in relation to the wish which the dream\ncreates. Dream disfigurement, then, turns out in reality to be an act of\nthe censor. We shall take into consideration everything which the\nanalysis of disagreeable dreams has brought to light if we reword our\nformula as follows: _The dream is the (disguised) fulfilment of a\n(suppressed, repressed) wish._[AN]\nNow there still remain as a particular species of dreams with painful\ncontent, dreams of anxiety, the inclusion of which under dreams of\nwishing will find least acceptance with the uninitiated. But I can\nsettle the problem of anxiety dreams in very short order; for what they\nmay reveal is not a new aspect of the dream problem; it is a question in\ntheir case of understanding neurotic anxiety in general. The fear which\nwe experience in the dream is only seemingly explained by the dream\ncontent. If we subject the content of the dream to analysis, we become\naware that the dream fear is no more justified by the dream content than\nthe fear in a phobia is justified by the idea upon which the phobia\ndepends. For example, it is true that it is possible to fall out of a\nwindow, and that some care must be exercised when one is near a window,\nbut it is inexplicable why the anxiety in the corresponding phobia is so\ngreat, and why it follows its victims to an extent so much greater than\nis warranted by its origin. The same explanation, then, which applies to\nthe phobia applies also to the dream of anxiety. In both cases the\nanxiety is only superficially attached to the idea which accompanies it\nand comes from another source.\nOn account of the intimate relation of dream fear to neurotic fear,\ndiscussion of the former obliges me to refer to the latter. In a little\nessay on \u201cThe Anxiety Neurosis,\u201d[AO] I maintained that neurotic fear has\nits origin in the sexual life, and corresponds to a libido which has\nbeen turned away from its object and has not succeeded in being applied.\nFrom this formula, which has since proved its validity more and more\nclearly, we may deduce the conclusion that the content of anxiety dreams\nis of a sexual nature, the libido belonging to which content has been\ntransformed into fear. Later on I shall have opportunity to support this\nassertion by the analysis of several dreams of neurotics. I shall have\noccasion to revert to the determinations in anxiety dreams and their\ncompatibility with the theory of wish-fulfilment when I again attempt to\napproach the theory of dreams.\nV\nTHE MATERIAL AND SOURCES OF DREAMS\nAfter coming to realise from the analysis of the dream of Irma\u2019s\ninjection that the dream is the fulfilment of a wish, our interest was\nnext directed to ascertaining whether we had thus discovered a universal\ncharacteristic of the dream, and for the time being we put aside every\nother question which may have been aroused in the course of that\ninterpretation. Now that we have reached the goal upon one of these\npaths, we may turn back and select a new starting-point for our\nexcursions among the problems of the dream, even though we may lose\nsight for a time of the theme of wish-fulfilment, which has been as yet\nby no means exhaustively treated.\nNow that we are able, by applying our process of interpretation, to\ndiscover a _latent_ dream content which far surpasses the _manifest_\ndream content in point of significance, we are impelled to take up the\nindividual dream problems afresh, in order to see whether the riddles\nand contradictions which seemed, when we had only the manifest content,\nbeyond our reach may not be solved for us satisfactorily.\nThe statements of the authors concerning the relation of the dream to\nwaking life, as well as concerning the source of the dream material,\nhave been given at length in the introductory chapter. We may recall\nthat there are three peculiarities of recollection in the dreams, which\nhave been often remarked but never explained:\n1. That the dream distinctly prefers impressions of the few days\npreceding; (Robert,[55] Str\u00fcmpell,[66] Hildebrandt,[35] also Weed-Hallam\n[33]).\n2. That it makes its selection according to principles other than those\nof our waking memory, in that it recalls not what is essential and\nimportant, but what is subordinate and disregarded (_cf._ p. 13).\n3. That it has at its disposal the earliest impressions of our\nchildhood, and brings to light details from this period of life which\nagain seem trivial to us, and which in waking life were considered long\nago forgotten.[AP]\nThese peculiarities in the selection of the dream material have of\ncourse been observed by the authors in connection with the manifest\ndream content.\n(_a_) _Recent and Indifferent Impressions in the Dream_\nIf I now consult my own experience concerning the source of the elements\nwhich appear in the dream, I must at once express the opinion that some\nreference to the experiences of _the day which has most recently passed_\nis to be found in every dream. Whatever dream I take up, whether my own\nor another\u2019s, this experience is always reaffirmed. Knowing this fact, I\ncan usually begin the work of interpretation by trying to learn the\nexperience of the previous day which has stimulated the dream; for many\ncases, indeed, this is the quickest way. In the case of the two dreams\nwhich I have subjected to close analysis in the preceding chapter (of\nIrma\u2019s injection, and of my uncle with the yellow beard) the reference\nto the previous day is so obvious that it needs no further elucidation.\nBut in order to show that this reference may be regularly demonstrated,\nI shall examine a portion of my own dream chronicle. I shall report the\ndreams only so far as is necessary for the discovery of the dream\nstimulus in question.\n1. I make a visit at a house where I am admitted only with difficulty,\n&c., and meanwhile I keep a woman _waiting_ for me.\n_Source._\u2014A conversation in the evening with a female relative to the\neffect that she would have to _wait_ for some aid which she demanded\nuntil, &c.\n2. I have written a _monograph_ about a certain (obscure) species of\nplant.\n_Source._\u2014I have seen in the show-window of a book store a _monograph_\nupon the genus cyclamen.\n3. I see two women on the street, _mother and daughter_, the latter of\nwhom is my patient.\n_Source._\u2014A female patient who is under treatment has told me what\ndifficulties her _mother_ puts in the way of her continuing the\ntreatment.\n4. At the book store of S. and R. I subscribe to a periodical which\ncosts _20 florins_ annually.\n_Source._\u2014During the day my wife has reminded me that I still owe her\n_20 florins_ of her weekly allowance.\n5. I receive a _communication_, in which I am treated as a member, from\nthe Social Democratic Committee.\n_Source._\u2014I have received _communications_ simultaneously from the\nLiberal Committee on Elections and from the president of the\nHumanitarian Society, of which I am really a member.\n6. A man on _a steep rock in the middle of the ocean_, after the manner\nof Boecklin.\n_Source._\u2014_Dreyfus on Devil\u2019s Island_; at the same time news from my\nrelatives in _England_, &c.\nThe question might be raised, whether the dream is invariably connected\nwith the events of the previous day, or whether the reference may be\nextended to impressions from a longer space of time in the immediate\npast. Probably this matter cannot claim primary importance, but I should\nlike to decide in favour of the exclusive priority of the day before the\ndream (the dream-day). As often as I thought I had found a case where an\nimpression of two or three days before had been the source of the dream,\nI could convince myself, after careful investigation, that this\nimpression had been remembered the day before, that a demonstrable\nreproduction had been interpolated between the day of the event and the\ntime of the dream, and, furthermore, I was able to point out the recent\noccasion upon which the recollection of the old impression might have\noccurred. On the other hand, I was unable to convince myself that a\nregular interval (H. Swoboda calls the first one of this kind eighteen\nhours) of biological significance occurs between the stimulating\nimpression of the day and its repetition in the dream.[AQ]\nI am, therefore, of the opinion that the stimulus for every dream is to\nbe found among those experiences \u201cupon which one has not yet slept\u201d for\na night.\nThus the impressions of the immediate past (with the exception of the\nday before the night of the dream) stand in no different relation to the\ndream content from those of times which are as far removed in the past\nas you please. The dream may select its material from all times of life,\nprovided only, that a chain of thought starting from one of the\nexperiences of the day of the dream (one of the \u201crecent\u201d impressions)\nreaches back to these earlier ones.\nBut why this preference for recent impressions? We shall reach some\nconjectures on this point if we subject one of the dreams already\nmentioned to a more exact analysis. I select the dream about the\nmonograph.\n_Content of the dream.\u2014I have written a monograph upon a certain plant.\nThe book lies before me, I am just turning over a folded coloured plate.\nA dried specimen of the plant is bound with every copy, as though from a\nherbarium._\n_Analysis._\u2014In the forenoon I saw in the show-window of a book store a\nbook entitled, _The Genus Cyclamen_, apparently a monograph on this\nplant.\nThe cyclamen is the favourite flower of my wife. I reproach myself for\nso seldom thinking to bring her flowers, as she wishes. In connection\nwith the theme \u201cbringing flowers,\u201d I am reminded of a story which I\nrecently told in a circle of friends to prove my assertion that\nforgetting is very often the purpose of the unconscious, and that in any\ncase it warrants a conclusion as to the secret disposition of the person\nwho forgets. A young woman who is accustomed to receive a bunch of\nflowers from her husband on her birthday, misses this token of affection\non a festive occasion of this sort, and thereupon bursts into tears. The\nhusband comes up, and is unable to account for her tears until she tells\nhim, \u201cTo-day is my birthday.\u201d He strikes his forehead and cries, \u201cWhy, I\nhad completely forgotten it,\u201d and wants to go out to get her some\nflowers. But she is not to be consoled, for she sees in the\nforgetfulness of her husband a proof that she does not play the same\npart in his thoughts as formerly. This Mrs. L. met my wife two days\nbefore, and told her that she was feeling well, and asked about me. She\nwas under my treatment years ago.\nSupplementary facts: I once actually wrote something like a monograph on\na plant, namely, an essay on the coca plant, which drew the attention of\nK. Koller to the an\u00e6sthetic properties of cocaine. I had hinted at this\nuse of the alkaloid in my publication, but I was not sufficiently\nthorough to pursue the matter further. This suggests that on the\nforenoon of the day after the dream (for the interpretation of which I\ndid not find time until the evening) I had thought of cocaine in a kind\nof day phantasy. In case I should ever be afflicted with glaucoma, I was\ngoing to go to Berlin, and there have myself operated upon, incognito,\nat the house of my Berlin friend, by a physician whom he would recommend\nto me. The surgeon, who would not know upon whom he was operating, would\nboast as usual how easy these operations had become since the\nintroduction of cocaine; I would not betray by a single sign that I had\nhad a share in making this discovery. With this phantasy were connected\nthoughts of how difficult it really is for a doctor to claim the medical\nservices of a colleague for his own person. I should be able to pay the\nBerlin eye specialist, who did not know me, like anyone else. Only after\nrecalling this day-dream do I realise that the recollection of a\ndefinite experience is concealed behind it. Shortly after Koller\u2019s\ndiscovery my father had, in fact, become ill with glaucoma; he was\noperated upon by my friend, the eye specialist, Dr. Koenigstein. Dr.\nKoller attended to the cocaine an\u00e6sthetisation, and thereupon made the\nremark that all three of the persons who had shared in the introduction\nof cocaine had been brought together on one case.\nI now proceed to think of the time when I was last reminded of this\naffair about the cocaine. This was a few days before, when I received a\n_Festschrift_, with whose publication grateful scholars had commemorated\nthe anniversary of their teacher and laboratory director. Among the\nhonours ascribed to persons connected with the laboratory, I found a\nnotice to the effect that the discovery of the an\u00e6sthetic properties of\ncocaine had been made there by K. Koller. Now I suddenly become aware\nthat the dream is connected with an experience of the previous evening.\nI had just accompanied Dr. Koenigstein to his home, and had spoken to\nhim about a matter which strongly arouses my interest whenever it is\nmentioned. While I was talking with him in the vestibule, Professor\nG\u00e4rtner and his young wife came up. I could not refrain from\ncongratulating them both upon their healthy appearance. Now Professor\nG\u00e4rtner is one of the authors of the _Festschrift_ of which I have just\nspoken, and may well have recalled it to me. Likewise Mrs. L., whose\nbirthday disappointment I have referred to, had been mentioned, in\nanother connection, to be sure, in the conversation with Dr.\nKoenigstein.\nI shall now try to explain the other determinations of the dream\ncontent. _A dried specimen_ of the plant accompanies the monograph as\nthough it were a _herbarium_. A recollection of the _gymnasium_ (school)\nis connected with the herbarium. The director of our _gymnasium_ once\ncalled the scholars of the higher classes together in order to have them\ninspect and clean the herbarium. Small worms had been found\u2014bookworms.\nThe director did not seem to have much confidence in my help, for he\nleft only a few leaves for me. I know to this day that there were\ncrucifers on them. My interest in botany was never very great. At my\npreliminary examination in botany, I was required to identify a\ncrucifer, and did not recognise it. I would have fared badly if my\ntheoretical knowledge had not helped me out. Crucifers suggest\ncomposites. The artichoke is really a composite, and the one which I\nmight call my favourite flower. My wife, who is more thoughtful than I,\noften brings this favourite flower of mine home from the market.\nI see the monograph which I have written lying before me. This, too, is\nnot without its reference. The friend whom I pictured wrote to me\nyesterday from Berlin: \u201cI think a great deal about your dream book. _I\nsee it lying before me finished, and am turning over its leaves._\u201d How I\nenvied him this prophetic power! If I could only see it lying already\nfinished before me!\n_The folded Coloured Plate._\u2014While I was a student of medicine, I\nsuffered much from a fondness for studying in _monographs_ exclusively.\nIn spite of my limited means, I subscribed to a number of the medical\narchives, in which the coloured plates gave me much delight. I was proud\nof this inclination for thoroughness. So, when I began to publish on my\nown account, I had to draw the plates for my own treatises, and I\nremember one of them turned out so badly that a kindly-disposed\ncolleague ridiculed me for it. This suggests, I don\u2019t know exactly how,\na very early memory from my youth. My father once thought it would be a\njoke to hand over a book with _coloured plates_ (_Description of a\nJourney in Persia_) to me and my eldest sister for destruction. This was\nhardly to be justified from an educational point of view. I was at the\ntime five years old, and my sister three, and the picture of our\nblissfully tearing this book to pieces (like an artichoke, I must add,\nleaf by leaf) is almost the only one from this time of life which has\nremained fresh in my memory. When I afterwards became a student, I\ndeveloped a distinct fondness for collecting and possessing books (an\nanalogy to the inclination for studying from monographs, a hobby which\noccurs in the dream thoughts with reference to cyclamen and artichoke).\nI became a book-worm (_cf._ herbarium). I have always referred this\nfirst passion of my life\u2014since I am engaging in retrospect\u2014to this\nchildhood impression, or rather I have recognised in this childish scene\na \u201cconcealing recollection\u201d for my subsequent love of books.[AR] Of\ncourse I also learned at an early age that our passions are often our\nsorrows. When I was seventeen years old I had a very respectable bill at\nthe book store, and no means with which to pay it, and my father would\nhardly accept the excuse that my inclination had not been fixed on\nsomething worse. But the mention of this later youthful experience\nimmediately brings me back to my conversation that evening with my\nfriend Dr. Koenigstein. For the talk on the evening of the dream-day\nbrought up the same old reproach that I am too fond of my hobbies.\nFor reasons which do not belong here, I shall not continue the\ninterpretation of this dream, but shall simply indicate the path which\nleads to it. In the course of the interpretation, I was reminded of my\nconversation with Dr. Koenigstein, and indeed of more than one portion\nof it. If I consider the subjects touched upon in this conversation, the\nmeaning of the dream becomes clear to me. All the thought associations\nwhich have been started, about the hobbies of my wife and of myself,\nabout the cocaine, about the difficulty of securing medical treatment\nfrom one\u2019s colleagues, my preference for monographic studies, and my\nneglect of certain subjects such as botany\u2014all this continues and\nconnects with some branch of this widely ramified conversation. The\ndream again takes on the character of a justification, of a pleading for\nmy rights, like the first analysed dream of Irma\u2019s injection; it even\ncontinues the theme which that dream started, and discusses it with the\nnew subject matter which has accrued in the interval between the two\ndreams. Even the apparently indifferent manner of expression of the\ndream receives new importance. The meaning is now: \u201cI am indeed the man\nwho has written that valuable and successful treatise (on cocaine),\u201d\njust as at that time I asserted for my justification: \u201cI am a thorough\nand industrious student;\u201d in both cases, then: \u201cI can afford to do\nthat.\u201d But I may dispense with the further interpretation of the dream,\nbecause my only purpose in reporting it was to examine the relation of\nthe dream content to the experience of the previous day which arouses\nit. As long as I know only the manifest content of this dream, but one\nrelation to a day impression becomes obvious; after I have made the\ninterpretation, a second source of the dream becomes evident in another\nexperience of the same day. The first of these impressions to which the\ndream refers is an indifferent one, a subordinate circumstance. I see a\nbook in a shop window whose title holds me for a moment, and whose\ncontents could hardly interest me. The second experience has great\npsychic value; I have talked earnestly with my friend, the eye\nspecialist, for about an hour, I have made allusions in this\nconversation which must have touched both of us closely, and which\nawakened memories revealing the most diverse feelings of my inner self.\nFurthermore, this conversation was broken off unfinished because some\nfriends joined us. What, now, is the relation of these two impressions\nof the day to each other and to the dream which followed during the next\nnight?\nI find in the manifest content merely an allusion to the indifferent\nimpression, and may thus reaffirm that the dream preferably takes up\ninto its content non-essential experiences. In the dream interpretation,\non the contrary, everything converges upon an important event which is\njustified in demanding attention. If I judge the dream in the only\ncorrect way, according to the latent content which is brought to light\nin the analysis, I have unawares come upon a new and important fact. I\nsee the notion that the dream deals only with the worthless fragments of\ndaily experience shattered; I am compelled also to contradict the\nassertion that our waking psychic life is not continued in the dream,\nand that the dream instead wastes psychic activity upon a trifling\nsubject matter. The opposite is true; what has occupied our minds during\nthe day also dominates our dream thoughts, and we take pains to dream\nonly of such matters as have given us food for thought during the day.\nPerhaps the most obvious explanation for the fact that I dream about\nsome indifferent impression of the day, while the impression which is\njustifiably stirring furnishes the occasion for dreaming, is that this\nagain is a phenomenon of the dream-disfigurement, which we have above\ntraced to a psychic power acting as a censor. The recollection of the\nmonograph on the genus cyclamen is employed as though it were an\nallusion to the conversation with my friend, very much as mention of the\nfriend in the dream of the deferred supper is represented by the\nallusion \u201csmoked salmon.\u201d The only question is, by what intermediate\nsteps does the impression of the monograph come to assume the relation\nof an allusion to the conversation with the eye specialist, since such a\nrelation is not immediately evident. In the example of the deferred\nsupper, the relation is set forth at the outset; \u201csmoked salmon,\u201d as the\nfavourite dish of the friend, belongs at once to the series of\nassociations which the person of the friend would call up in the lady\nwho is dreaming. In our new example we have two separated impressions,\nwhich seem at first glance to have nothing in common except that they\noccur on the same day. The monograph catches my attention in the\nforenoon; I take part in the conversation in the evening. The answer\nsupplied by the analysis is as follows: Such relations between the two\nimpressions do not at first exist, but are established subsequently\nbetween the presentation content of the one impression and the\npresentation content of the other. I have recently emphasised the\ncomponents in this relation in the course of recording the analysis.\nWith the notion of the monograph on cyclamen I should probably associate\nthe idea that cyclamen is my wife\u2019s favourite flower only under some\noutside influence, and this is perhaps the further recollection of the\nbunch of flowers missed by Mrs. L. I do not believe that these\nunderlying thoughts would have been sufficient to call forth a dream.\n\u201cThere needs no ghost, my lord, come from the grave\nTo tell us this,\u201d\nas we read in _Hamlet_. But behold! I am reminded in the analysis that\nthe name of the man who interrupted our conversation was G\u00e4rtner\n(Gardener), and that I found his wife in blooming health;[AS] I even\nremember now that one of my female patients, who bears the pretty name\nof Flora, was for a time the main subject of our conversation. It must\nhave happened that I completed the connection between the two events of\nthe day, the indifferent and the exciting one, by means of these links\nfrom the series of associations belonging to the idea of botany. Other\nrelations are then established, that of cocaine, which can with perfect\ncorrectness form a go-between connecting the person of Dr. Koenigstein\nwith the botanical monograph which I have written, and strengthen the\nfusion of the two series of associations into one, so that now a portion\nof the first experience may be used as an allusion to the second.\nI am prepared to find this explanation attacked as arbitrary or\nartificial. What would have happened if Professor G\u00e4rtner and his\nblooming wife had not come up, and if the patient who was talked about\nhad been called, not Flora, but Anna? The answer is easy, however. If\nthese thought-relations had not been present, others would probably have\nbeen selected. It is so easy to establish relations of this sort, as the\njoking questions and conundrums with which we amuse ourselves daily\nsuffice to show. The range of wit is unlimited. To go a step further: if\nit had been impossible to establish interrelations of sufficient\nabundance between the two impressions of the day, the dream would simply\nhave resulted differently; another of the indifferent impressions of the\nday, such as come to us in multitudes and are forgotten, would have\ntaken the place of the monograph in the dream, would have secured a\nconnection with the content of the talk, and would have represented it\nin the dream. Since it was the impression of the monograph and no other\nthat had this fate, this impression was probably the most suitable for\nthe establishment of the connection. One need not be astonished, like\nLessing\u2019s H\u00e4nschen Schlau, because \u201cit is the rich people of the world\nwho possess the most money.\u201d\nStill the psychological process by which, according to our conception,\nthe indifferent experience is substituted for the psychologically\nimportant one, seems odd to us and open to question. In a later chapter\nwe shall undertake the task of making this seemingly incorrect operation\nmore intelligible. We are here concerned only with consequences of this\nprocedure, whose assumption we have been forced to make by the regularly\nrecurring experiences of dream analysis. But the process seems to be\nthat, in the course of those intermediate steps, a displacement\u2014let us\nsay of the psychic accent\u2014has taken place, until ideas that are at first\nweakly charged with intensity, by taking over the charge from ideas\nwhich have a stronger initial intensity, reach a degree of strength,\nwhich enables them to force their way into consciousness. Such\ndisplacements do not at all surprise us when it is a question of the\nbestowal of affects or of the motor actions in general. The fact that\nthe woman who has remained single transfers her affection to animals,\nthat the bachelor becomes a passionate collector, that the soldier\ndefends a scrap of coloured cloth, his flag, with his life-blood, that\nin a love affair a momentary clasping of hands brings bliss, or that in\n_Othello_ a lost handkerchief causes a burst of rage\u2014all these are\nexamples of psychic displacement which seem unquestionable to us. But\nif, in the same manner and according to the same fundamental principles,\na decision is made as to what is to reach our consciousness and what is\nto be withheld from it, that is to say, what we are to think\u2014this\nproduces an impression of morbidity, and we call it an error of thought\nif it occurs in waking life. We may here anticipate the result of a\ndiscussion which will be undertaken later\u2014namely, to the effect that the\npsychic process which we have recognised as dream displacement proves to\nbe not a process morbidly disturbed, but a process differing from the\nnormal merely in being of a more primitive nature.\nWe thus find in the fact that the dream content takes up remnants of\ntrivial experiences a manifestation of dream disfigurement (by means of\ndisplacement), and we may recall that we have recognised this dream\ndisfigurement as the work of a censor which controls the passage between\ntwo psychic instances. We accordingly expect that dream analysis will\nregularly reveal to us the genuine, significant source of the dream in\nthe life of the day, the recollection of which has transferred its\naccent to some indifferent recollection. This conception brings us into\ncomplete opposition to Robert\u2019s[55] theory, which thus becomes valueless\nfor us. The fact which Robert was trying to explain simply doesn\u2019t\nexist; its assumption is based upon a misunderstanding, upon the failure\nto substitute the real meaning of the dream for its apparent content.\nFurther objection may be made to Robert\u2019s doctrine: If it were really\nthe duty of the dream, by means of a special psychic activity, to rid\nour memory of the \u201cslag\u201d of the recollections of the day, our sleep\nwould have to be more troubled and employed in a more strained effort\nthan we may suppose it to be from our waking life. For the number of\nindifferent impressions received during the day, against which we should\nhave to protect our memory, is obviously infinitely large; the night\nwould not be long enough to accomplish the task. It is very much more\nprobable that the forgetting of indifferent impressions takes place\nwithout any active interference on the part of our psychic powers.\nStill something cautions us against taking leave of Robert\u2019s idea\nwithout further consideration. We have left unexplained the fact that\none of the indifferent day-impressions\u2014one from the previous day\nindeed\u2014regularly furnished a contribution to the dream-content.\nRelations between this impression and the real source of the dream do\nnot always exist from the beginning; as we have seen, they are\nestablished only subsequently, in the course of the dream-work, as\nthough in order to serve the purpose of the intended displacement. There\nmust, therefore, be some necessity to form connections in this\nparticular direction, of the recent, although indifferent impression;\nthe latter must have special fitness for this purpose because of some\nproperty. Otherwise it would be just as easy for the dream thoughts to\ntransfer their accent to some inessential member of their own series of\nassociations.\nThe following experiences will lead us to an explanation. If a day has\nbrought two or more experiences which are fitted to stimulate a dream,\nthen the dream fuses the mention of both into a single whole; it obeys\nan _impulse to fashion a whole out of them_; for instance: One summer\nafternoon I entered a railroad compartment, in which I met two friends\nwho were unknown to each other. One of them was an influential\ncolleague, the other a member of a distinguished family, whose physician\nI was; I made the two gentlemen acquainted with each other; but during\nthe long ride I was the go-between in the conversation, so that I had to\ntreat a subject of conversation now with the one, now with the other. I\nasked my colleague to recommend a common friend who had just begun his\nmedical practice. He answered that he was convinced of the young man\u2019s\nthoroughness, but that his plain appearance would make his entrance into\nhouseholds of rank difficult. I answered: \u201cThat is just why he needs\nrecommendation.\u201d Soon afterwards I asked the other fellow-traveller\nabout the health of his aunt\u2014the mother of one of my patients\u2014who was at\nthe time prostrated by a serious illness. During the night after this\njourney I dreamt that the young friend, for whom I had asked assistance,\nwas in a splendid salon, and was making a funeral oration to a select\ncompany with the air of a man of the world\u2014the oration being upon the\nold lady (now dead for the purposes of the dream) who was the aunt of\nthe second fellow-traveller. (I confess frankly that I had not been on\ngood terms with this lady.) My dream had thus found connections between\nthe two impressions of the day, and by means of them composed a unified\nsituation.\nIn view of many similar experiences, I am driven to conclude that a kind\nof compulsion exists for the dream function, forcing it to bring\ntogether in the dream all the available sources of dream stimulation\ninto a unified whole.[AT] In a subsequent chapter (on the dream\nfunction) we shall become acquainted with this impulse for putting\ntogether as a part of condensation another primary psychic process.\nI shall now discuss the question whether the source from which the dream\noriginates, and to which our analysis leads, must always be a recent\n(and significant) event, or whether a subjective experience, that is to\nsay, the recollection of a psychologically valuable experience\u2014a chain\nof thought\u2014can take the part of a dream stimulus. The answer, which\nresults most unequivocally from numerous analyses, is to the following\neffect. The stimulus for the dream may be a subjective occurrence, which\nhas been made recent, as it were, by the mental activity during the day.\nIt will probably not be out of place here to give a synopsis of various\nconditions which may be recognised as sources of dreams.\nThe source of a dream may be:\n(_a_) A recent and psychologically significant experience which is\ndirectly represented in the dream.[AU]\n(_b_) Several recent, significant experiences, which are united by the\ndream into a whole.[AV]\n(_c_) One or more recent and significant experiences, which are\nrepresented in the dream by the mention of a contemporary but\nindifferent experience.[AW]\n(_d_) A subjective significant experience (a recollection, train of\nthought), which is _regularly_ represented in the dream by the mention\nof a recent but indifferent impression.[AX]\nAs may be seen, in dream interpretation the condition is firmly adhered\nto throughout that each component of the dream repeats a recent\nimpression of the day. The element which is destined to representation\nin the dream may either belong to the presentations surrounding the\nactual dream stimulus itself\u2014and, furthermore, either as an essential or\nan inessential element of the same\u2014or it may originate in the\nneighbourhood of an indifferent impression, which, through associations\nmore or less rich, has been brought into relation with the thoughts\nsurrounding the dream stimulus. The apparent multiplicity of the\nconditions here is produced by _the alternative according to whether\ndisplacement has or has not taken place_, and we may note that this\nalternative serves to explain the contrasts of the dream just as readily\nas the ascending series from partially awake to fully awake brain cells\nin the medical theory of the dream (_cf._ p. 64).\nConcerning this series, it is further notable that the element which is\npsychologically valuable, but not recent (a train of thought, a\nrecollection) may be replaced, for the purposes of dream formation, by a\nrecent, but psychologically indifferent, element, if only these two\nconditions be observed: 1. That the dream shall contain a reference to\nsomething which has been recently experienced; 2. That the dream\nstimulus shall remain a psychologically valuable train of thought. In a\nsingle case (_a_) both conditions are fulfilled by the same impression.\nIf it be added that the same indifferent impressions which are used for\nthe dream, as long as they are recent, lose this availability as soon as\nthey become a day (or at most several days) older, the assumption must\nbe made that the very freshness of an impression gives it a certain\npsychological value for dream formation, which is somewhat equivalent to\nthe value of emotionally accentuated memories or trains of thought. We\nshall be able to see the basis of this value of _recent_ impressions for\ndream formation only with the help of certain psychological\nconsiderations which will appear later.[AY]\nIncidentally our attention is called to the fact that important changes\nin the material comprised by our ideas and our memory may be brought\nabout unconsciously and at night. The injunction that one should sleep\nfor a night upon any affair before making a final decision about it is\nobviously fully justified. But we see that at this point we have\nproceeded from the psychology of dreaming to that of sleep, a step for\nwhich there will often be occasion.\nNow there arises an objection threatening to invalidate the conclusions\nwe have just reached. If indifferent impressions can get into the dream\nonly in case they are recent, how does it happen that we find also in\nthe dream content elements from earlier periods in our lives, which at\nthe time when they were recent possessed, as Str\u00fcmpell expresses it, no\npsychic value, which, therefore, ought to have been forgotten long ago,\nand which, therefore, are neither fresh nor psychologically significant?\nThis objection can be fully met if we rely upon the results furnished by\npsychoanalysis of neurotics. The solution is as follows: The process of\ndisplacement which substitutes indifferent material for that having\npsychic significance (for dreaming as well as for thinking) has already\ntaken place in those earlier periods of life, and has since become fixed\nin the memory. Those elements which were originally indifferent are in\nfact no longer so, since they have acquired the value of psychologically\nsignificant material. That which has actually remained indifferent can\nnever be reproduced in the dream.\nIt will be correct to suppose from the foregoing discussion that I\nmaintain that there are no indifferent dream stimuli, and that,\naccordingly, there are no harmless dreams. This I believe to be the\ncase, thoroughly and exclusively, allowance being made for the dreams of\nchildren and perhaps for short dream reactions to nocturnal sensations.\nWhatever one may dream, it is either manifestly recognisable as\npsychically significant or it is disfigured, and can be judged correctly\nonly after a complete interpretation, when, as before, it may be\nrecognised as possessing psychic significance. The dream never concerns\nitself with trifles; we do not allow ourselves to be disturbed in our\nsleep by matters of slight importance. Dreams which are apparently\nharmless turn out to be sinister if one takes pains to interpret them;\nif I may be permitted the expression, they all have \u201cthe mark of the\nbeast.\u201d As this is another point on which I may expect opposition, and\nas I am glad of an opportunity to show dream-disfigurement at work, I\nshall here subject a number of dreams from my collection to analysis.\n1. An intelligent and refined young lady, who, however, in conduct,\nbelongs to the class we call reserved, to the \u201cstill waters,\u201d relates\nthe following dream:\u2014\n_Her husband asks: \u201cShould not the piano be tuned?\u201d She answers: \u201cIt\nwon\u2019t pay; the hammers would have to be newly buffed too.\u201d_ This repeats\nan actual event of the previous day. Her husband had asked such a\nquestion, and she had answered something similar. But what is the\nsignificance of her dreaming it? She tells of the piano, indeed, that it\nis a _disgusting old box_ which has a bad tone; it is one of the things\nwhich her husband had before they were married,[AZ] &c., but the key to\nthe true solution lies in the phrase: _It won\u2019t pay._ This originated in\na visit made the day before to a lady friend. Here she was asked to take\noff her coat, but she declined, saying, \u201c_It won\u2019t pay._ I must go in a\nmoment.\u201d At this point, I recall that during yesterday\u2019s analysis she\nsuddenly took hold of her coat, a button of which had opened. It is,\ntherefore, as if she had said, \u201cPlease don\u2019t look in this direction; it\nwon\u2019t pay.\u201d Thus \u201c_box_\u201d develops into \u201c_chest_,\u201d or breast-box\n(\u201cbust\u201d), and the interpretation of the dream leads directly to a time\nin her bodily development when she was dissatisfied with her shape. It\nalso leads to earlier periods, if we take into consideration\n\u201c_disgusting_\u201d and \u201c_bad tone_,\u201d and remember how often in allusions and\nin dreams the two small hemispheres of the feminine body take the\nplace\u2014as a substitute and as an antithesis\u2014of the large ones.\nII. I may interrupt this dream to insert a brief harmless dream of a\nyoung man. He dreamt that _he was putting on his winter overcoat again,\nwhich was terrible_. The occasion for this dream is apparently the cold\nweather, which has recently set in again. On more careful examination we\nnote that the two short portions of the dream do not fit together well,\nfor what is there \u201cterrible\u201d about wearing a heavy or thick coat in the\ncold? Unfortunately for the harmlessness of this dream, the first idea\neduced in analysis is the recollection that on the previous day a lady\nhad secretly admitted to him that her last child owed its existence to\nthe bursting of a condom. He now reconstructs his thoughts in accordance\nwith this suggestion: A thin condom is dangerous, a thick one is bad.\nThe condom is an \u201covercoat\u201d (_\u00dcberzieher_), for it is put over\nsomething; _Ueberzieher_ is also the name given in German to a thin\novercoat. An experience like the one related by the lady would indeed be\n\u201cterrible\u201d for an unmarried man.\u2014We may now return to our other harmless\ndreamer.\nIII. _She puts a candle into a candlestick; but the candle is broken, so\nthat it does not stand straight. The girls at school say she is clumsy;\nthe young lady replies that it is not her fault._\nHere, too, there is an actual occasion for the dream; the day before she\nhad actually put a candle into a candlestick; but this one was not\nbroken. A transparent symbolism has been employed here. The candle is an\nobject which excites the feminine genitals; its being broken, so that it\ndoes not stand straight, signifies impotence on the man\u2019s part (\u201cit is\nnot her fault\u201d). But does this young woman, carefully brought up, and a\nstranger to all obscenity, know of this application of the candle? She\nhappens to be able to tell how she came by this information. While\nriding in a boat on the Rhine, another boat passes containing students\nwho are singing or rather yelling, with great delight: \u201cWhen the Queen\nof Sweden with closed shutters and the candles of Apollo....\u201d\nShe does not hear or understand the last word. Her husband is asked to\ngive her the required explanation. These verses are then replaced in the\ndream content by the harmless recollection of a command which she once\nexecuted clumsily at a girls\u2019 boarding school, this occurring by means\nof the common features _closed shutters_. The connection between the\ntheme of onanism and that of impotence is clear enough. \u201cApollo\u201d in the\nlatent dream content connects this dream with an earlier one in which\nthe virgin Pallas figured. All this is obviously not harmless.\nIV. Lest it may seem too easy a matter to draw conclusions from dreams\nconcerning the dreamer\u2019s real circumstances, I add another dream coming\nfrom the same person which likewise appears harmless. \u201c_I dreamt of\ndoing something_,\u201d she relates, \u201c_which I actually did during the day,\nthat is to say, I filled a little trunk so full of hooks that I had\ndifficulty in closing it. My dream was just like the actual\noccurrence._\u201d Here the person relating the dream herself attaches chief\nimportance to the correspondence between the dream and reality. All such\ncriticisms upon the dream and remarks about it, although they have\nsecured a place in waking thought, regularly belong to the latent dream\ncontent, as later examples will further demonstrate. We are told, then,\nthat what the dream relates has actually taken place during the day. It\nwould take us too far afield to tell how we reach the idea of using the\nEnglish language to help us in the interpretation of this dream. Suffice\nit to say that it is again a question of a little box (_cf._ p. 130, the\ndream of the dead child in the box) which has been filled so full that\nnothing more can go into it. Nothing in the least sinister this time.\nIn all these \u201charmless\u201d dreams the sexual factor as a motive for the\nexercise of the censor receives striking prominence. But this is a\nmatter of primary importance, which we must postpone.\n(_b_) _Infantile Experiences as the Source of Dreams_\nAs the third of the peculiarities of the dream content, we have cited\nfrom all the authors (except Robert) the fact that impressions from the\nearliest times of our lives, which seem not to be at the disposal of the\nwaking memory, may appear in the dream. It is, of course, difficult to\njudge how often or how seldom this occurs, because the respective\nelements of the dream are not recognised according to their origin after\nwaking. The proof that we are dealing with childhood impressions must\nthus be reached objectively, and the conditions necessary for this\nhappen to coincide only in rare instances. The story is told by A.\nMaury,[48] as being particularly conclusive, of a man who decided to\nvisit his birthplace after twenty years\u2019 absence. During the night\nbefore his departure, he dreams that he is in an altogether strange\ndistrict, and that he there meets a strange man with whom he has a\nconversation. Having afterward returned to his home, he was able to\nconvince himself that this strange district really existed in the\nneighbourhood of his home town, and the strange man in the dream turned\nout to be a friend of his dead father who lived there. Doubtless, a\nconclusive proof that he had seen both the man and the district in his\nchildhood. The dream, moreover, is to be interpreted as a dream of\nimpatience, like that of the girl who carries her ticket for the concert\nof the evening in her pocket (p. 110), of the child whose father had\npromised him an excursion to the Hameau, and the like. The motives\nexplaining why just this impression of childhood is reproduced for the\ndreamer cannot, of course, be discovered without an analysis.\nOne of the attendants at my lectures, who boasted that his dreams were\nvery rarely subject to disfigurement, told me that he had sometime\nbefore in a dream seen _his former tutor in bed with his nurse_, who had\nbeen in the household until he was eleven years old. The location of\nthis scene does not occur to him in the dream. As he was much\ninterested, he told the dream to his elder brother, who laughingly\nconfirmed its reality. The brother said he remembered the affair very\nwell, for he was at the time six years old. The lovers were in the habit\nof making him, the elder boy, drunk with beer, whenever circumstances\nwere favourable for nocturnal relations. The smaller child, at that time\nthree years old\u2014our dreamer\u2014who slept in the same room as the nurse, was\nnot considered an obstacle.\nIn still another case it may be definitely ascertained, without the aid\nof dream interpretation, that the dream contains elements from\nchildhood; that is, if it be a so-called _perennial_ dream, which being\nfirst dreamt in childhood, later appears again and again after adult age\nhas been reached. I may add a few examples of this sort to those already\nfamiliar, although I have never made the acquaintance of such a\nperennial dream in my own case. A physician in the thirties tells me\nthat a yellow lion, about which he can give the most detailed\ninformation, has often appeared in his dream-life from the earliest\nperiod of his childhood to the present day. This lion, known to him from\nhis dreams, was one day discovered _in natura_ as a long-forgotten\nobject made of porcelain, and on that occasion the young man learned\nfrom his mother that this object had been his favourite toy in early\nchildhood, a fact which he himself could no longer remember.\nIf we now turn from the manifest dream content to the dream thoughts\nwhich are revealed only upon analysis, the co-operation of childhood\nexperiences may be found to exist even in dreams whose content would not\nhave led us to suspect anything of the sort. I owe a particularly\ndelightful and instructive example of such a dream to my honoured\ncolleague of the \u201cyellow lion.\u201d After reading Nansen\u2019s account of his\npolar expedition, he dreamt that he was giving the bold explorer\nelectrical treatment in an ice field for an isch\u00e6mia of which the latter\ncomplained! In the analysis of this dream, he remembered a story of his\nchildhood, without which the dream remains entirely unintelligible. When\nhe was a child, three or four years old, he was listening attentively to\na conversation of older people about trips of exploration, and presently\nasked papa whether exploration was a severe illness. He had apparently\nconfused \u201ctrips\u201d with \u201crips,\u201d and the ridicule of his brothers and\nsisters prevented his ever forgetting the humiliating experience.\nThe case is quite similar when, in the analysis of the dream of the\nmonograph on the genus cyclamen, I happen upon the recollection,\nretained from childhood, that my father allowed me to destroy a book\nembellished with coloured plates when I was a little boy five years old.\nIt will perhaps be doubted whether this recollection actually took part\nin the composition of the dream content, and it will be intimated that\nthe process of analysis has subsequently established the connection. But\nthe abundance and intricacy of the ties of association vouch for the\ntruth of my explanation: cyclamen\u2014favourite flower\u2014favourite\ndish\u2014artichoke; to pick to pieces like an artichoke, leaf by leaf (a\nphrase which at that time rang in our ears \u00e0 propos of the dividing up\nof the Chinese Empire)\u2014herbarium-bookworm, whose favourite dish is\nbooks. I may state further that the final meaning of the dream, which I\nhave not given here, has the most intimate connection with the content\nof the childhood scene.\nIn another series of dreams we learn from analysis that the wish itself,\nwhich has given rise to the dream, and whose fulfilment the dream turns\nout to be, has originated in childhood\u2014until one is astonished to find\nthat the child with all its impulses lives on in the dream.\nI shall now continue the interpretation of a dream which has already\nproved instructive\u2014I refer to the dream in which friend R. is my uncle\n(p. 116). We have carried its interpretation far enough for the\nwish-motive, of being appointed professor, to assert itself tangibly;\nand we have explained the affection displayed in the dream for friend R.\nas a fiction of opposition and spite against the aspersion of the two\ncolleagues, who appear in the dream thoughts. The dream was my own; I\nmay, therefore, continue the analysis by stating that my feelings were\nnot quite satisfied by the solution reached. I know that my opinion of\nthese colleagues who are so badly treated in the dream thoughts would\nhave been expressed in quite different terms in waking life; the potency\nof the wish not to share their fate in the matter of appointment seemed\nto me too slight to account for the discrepancy between my estimate in\nthe dream and that of waking. If my desire to be addressed by a new\ntitle proves so strong it gives proof of a morbid ambition, which I did\nnot know to exist in me, and which I believe is far from my thoughts. I\ndo not know how others, who think they know me, would judge me, for\nperhaps I have really been ambitious; but if this be true, my ambition\nhas long since transferred itself to other objects than the title and\nrank of assistant-professor.\nWhence, then, the ambition which the dream has ascribed to me? Here I\nremember a story which I heard often in my childhood, that at my birth\nan old peasant\u2019s wife had prophesied to my happy mother (I was her\nfirst-born) that she had given to the world a great man. Such prophecies\nmust occur very frequently; there are so many mothers happy in\nexpectation, and so many old peasant wives whose influence on earth has\nwaned, and who have therefore turned their eyes towards the future. The\nprophetess was not likely to suffer for it either. Might my hunger for\ngreatness have originated from this source? But here I recollect an\nimpression from the later years of my childhood, which would serve still\nbetter as an explanation. It was of an evening at an inn on the\nPrater,[BA] where my parents were accustomed to take me when I was\neleven or twelve years old. We noticed a man who went from table to\ntable and improvised verses upon any subject that was given to him. I\nwas sent to bring the poet to our table and he showed himself thankful\nfor the message. Before asking for his subject he threw off a few rhymes\nabout me, and declared it probable, if he could trust his inspiration,\nthat I would one day become a \u201cminister.\u201d I can still distinctly\nremember the impression made by this second prophecy. It was at the time\nof the election for the municipal ministry; my father had recently\nbrought home pictures of those elected to the ministry\u2014Herbst, Giskra,\nUnger, Berger, and others\u2014and we had illuminated them in honour of these\ngentlemen. There were even some Jews among them; every industrious\nJewish schoolboy therefore had the making of a minister in him. Even the\nfact that until shortly before my enrolment in the University I wanted\nto study jurisprudence, and changed my plans only at the last moment,\nmust be connected with the impressions of that time. A minister\u2019s career\nis under no circumstances open to a medical man. And now for my dream! I\nbegin to see that it transplants me from the sombre present to the\nhopeful time of the municipal election, and fulfils my wish of that time\nto the fullest extent. In treating my two estimable and learned\ncolleagues so badly, because they are Jews, the one as a simpleton and\nthe other as a criminal\u2014in doing this I act as though I were the\nminister of education, I put myself in his place. What thorough revenge\nI take upon his Excellency! He refuses to appoint me professor\nextraordinarius, and in return I put myself in his place in the dream.\nAnother case establishes the fact that although the wish which actuates\nthe dream is a present one, it nevertheless draws great intensification\nfrom childhood memories. I refer to a series of dreams which are based\nupon the longing to go to Rome. I suppose I shall still have to satisfy\nthis longing by means of dreams for a long time to come, because, at the\ntime of year which is at my disposal for travelling, a stay at Rome is\nto be avoided on account of considerations of health.[BB] Thus I once\ndreamt of seeing the Tiber and the bridge of St. Angelo from the window\nof a railroad compartment; then the train starts, and it occurs to me\nthat I have never entered the city at all. The view which I saw in the\ndream was modelled after an engraving which I had noticed in passing the\nday before in the parlour of one of my patients. On another occasion\nsome one is leading me upon a hill and showing me Rome half enveloped in\nmist, and so far in the distance that I am astonished at the\ndistinctness of the view. The content of this dream is too rich to be\nfully reported here. The motive, \u201cto see the promised land from afar,\u201d\nis easily recognisable in it. The city is L\u00fcbeck, which I first saw in\nthe mist; the original of the hill is the Gleichenberg. In a third\ndream, I am at last in Rome, as the dream tells me. To my\ndisappointment, the scenery which I see is anything but urban. _A little\nriver with black water, on one side of which are black rocks, on the\nother large white flowers. I notice a certain Mr. Zucker_ (with whom I\nam superficially acquainted), _and make up my mind to ask him to show me\nthe way into the city._ It is apparent that I am trying in vain to see a\ncity in the dream which I have never seen in waking life. If I resolve\nthe landscape into its elements, the white flowers indicate Ravenna,\nwhich is known to me, and which, for a time at least, deprived Rome of\nits leading place as capital of Italy. In the swamps around Ravenna we\nhad seen the most beautiful water-lilies in the middle of black pools of\nwater; the dream makes them grow on meadows, like the narcissi of our\nown Aussee, because at Ravenna it was such tedious work to fetch them\nout of the water. The black rock, so close to the water, vividly recalls\nthe valley of the Tepl at Karlsbad. \u201cKarlsbad\u201d now enables me to account\nfor the peculiar circumstance that I ask Mr. Zucker the way. In the\nmaterial of which the dream is composed appear also two of those amusing\nJewish anecdotes, which conceal so much profound and often bitter\nworldly wisdom, and which we are so fond of quoting in our conversation\nand letters. One is the story of the \u201cconstitution,\u201d and tells how a\npoor Jew sneaks into the express train for Karlsbad without a ticket,\nhow he is caught and is treated more and more unkindly at each call for\ntickets by the conductor, and how he tells a friend, whom he meets at\none of the stations during his miserable journey, and who asks him where\nhe is travelling: \u201cTo Karlsbad, if my constitution will stand it.\u201d\nAssociated with this in memory is another story about a Jew who is\nignorant of French, and who has express instructions to ask in Paris for\nthe way to the Rue Richelieu. Paris was for many years the object of my\nown longing, and I took the great satisfaction with which I first set\nfoot on the pavement in Paris as a warrant that I should also attain the\nfulfilment of other wishes. Asking for the way is again a direct\nallusion to Rome, for of course all roads lead to Rome. Moreover, the\nname Zucker (English, sugar) again points to _Karlsbad_, whither we send\nall persons afflicted with the _constitutional_ disease, diabetes\n(_Zuckerkrankheit_, sugar-disease). The occasion for this dream was the\nproposal of my Berlin friend that we should meet in Prague at Easter. A\nfurther allusion to sugar and diabetes was to be found in the matters\nwhich I had to talk over with him.\nA fourth dream, occurring shortly after the last one mentioned, brings\nme back to Rome. I see a street-corner before me and am astonished to\nsee so many German placards posted there. On the day before I had\nwritten my friend with prophetic vision that Prague would probably not\nbe a comfortable resort for German travellers. The dream, therefore,\nsimultaneously expressed the wish to meet him at Rome instead of at the\nBohemian city, and a desire, which probably originated during my student\ndays, that the German language might be accorded more tolerance in\nPrague. Besides I must have understood the Czech language in the first\nthree years of my childhood, because I was born in a small village of\nMoravia, inhabited by Slavs. A Czech nursery rhyme, which I heard in my\nseventeenth year, became, without effort on my part, so imprinted upon\nmy memory that I can repeat it to this day, although I have no idea of\nits meaning. There is then no lack in these dreams also of manifold\nrelations to impressions from the first years of my life.\nIt was during my last journey to Italy, which, among other places, took\nme past Lake Trasimenus, that I at last found what re-enforcement my\nlonging for the Eternal City had received from the impressions of my\nyouth; this was after I had seen the Tiber, and had turned back with\npainful emotions when I was within eighty kilometers of Rome. I was just\nbroaching the plan of travelling to Naples via Rome the next year, when\nthis sentence, which I must have read in one of our classical authors,\noccurred to me: \u201cIt is a question which of the two paced up and down in\nhis room the more impatiently after he had made the plan to go to\nRome\u2014Assistant-Headmaster Winckelman or the great general Hannibal.\u201d I\nmyself had walked in Hannibal\u2019s footsteps; like him I was destined never\nto see Rome, and he too had gone to Campania after the whole world had\nexpected him in Rome. Hannibal, with whom I had reached this point of\nsimilarity, had been my favourite hero during my years at the Gymnasium;\nlike so many boys of my age, I bestowed my sympathies during the Punic\nwar, not on the Romans, but on the Carthaginians. Then, when I came\nfinally to understand the consequences of belonging to an alien race,\nand was forced by the anti-semitic sentiment among my class-mates to\nassume a definite attitude, the figure of the semitic commander assumed\nstill greater proportions in my eyes. Hannibal and Rome symbolised for\nme as a youth the antithesis between the tenaciousness of the Jews and\nthe organisation of the Catholic Church. The significance for our\nemotional life which the anti-semitic movement has since assumed helped\nto fix the thoughts and impressions of that earlier time. Thus the wish\nto get to Rome has become the cover and symbol in my dream-life for\nseveral warmly cherished wishes, for the realisation of which one might\nwork with the perseverance and single-mindedness of the Punic general,\nand whose fulfilment sometimes seems as little favoured by fortune as\nthe wish of Hannibal\u2019s life to enter Rome.\nAnd now for the first time I happen upon the youthful experience which,\neven to-day, still manifests its power in all these emotions and dreams.\nI may have been ten or twelve years old when my father began to take me\nwith him on his walks, and to reveal to me his views about the things of\nthis world in his conversation. In this way he once told me, in order to\nshow into how much better times I had been born than he, the following:\n\u201cWhile I was a young man, I was walking one Saturday on a street in the\nvillage where you were born; I was handsomely dressed and wore a new fur\ncap. Along comes a Christian, who knocks my cap into the mud with one\nblow and shouts: \u201cJew, get off the sidewalk.\u201d \u201cAnd what did you do?\u201d \u201cI\nwent into the street and picked up the cap,\u201d was the calm answer. That\ndid not seem heroic on the part of the big strong man, who was leading\nme, a little fellow, by the hand. I contrasted this situation, which did\nnot please me, with another more in harmony with my feelings\u2014the scene\nin which Hannibal\u2019s father, Hamilcar[BC] Barka made his boy swear at the\ndomestic altar to take vengeance on the Romans. Since that time Hannibal\nhas had a place in my phantasies.\u201d\nI think I can follow my enthusiasm for the Carthaginian general still\nfurther back into my childhood, so that possibly we have here the\ntransference of an already formed emotional relation to a new vehicle.\nOne of the first books which fell into my childish hands, after I\nlearned to read, was Thiers\u2019 _Konsulat und Kaiserreich_ (Consulship and\nEmpire); I remember I pasted on the flat backs of my wooden soldiers\nlittle labels with the names of the Imperial marshals, and that at that\ntime Mass\u00e9na (as a Jew Menasse) was already my avowed favourite.\nNapoleon himself follows Hannibal in crossing the Alps. And perhaps the\ndevelopment of this martial ideal can be traced still further back into\nmy childhood, to the wish which the now friendly, now hostile,\nintercourse during my first three years with a boy a year older than\nmyself must have actuated in the weaker of the two playmates.\nThe deeper one goes in the analysis of dreams, the more often one is put\non the track of childish experiences which play the part of dream\nsources in the latent dream content.\nWe have learned (p. 16) that the dream very rarely reproduces\nexperiences in such a manner that they constitute the sole manifest\ndream content, unabridged and unchanged. Still some authentic examples\nshowing this process have been reported, and I can add some new ones\nwhich again refer to infantile scenes. In the case of one of my\npatients, a dream once gave a barely disfigured reproduction of a sexual\noccurrence, which was immediately recognised as an accurate\nrecollection. The memory of it indeed had never been lost in waking\nlife, but it had been greatly obscured, and its revivification was a\nresult of the preceding work of analysis. The dreamer had at the age of\ntwelve visited a bed-ridden schoolmate, who had exposed himself by a\nmovement in bed, probably only by chance. At the sight of the genitals,\nhe was seized by a kind of compulsion, exposed himself and took hold of\nthe member belonging to the other boy, who, however, looked at him with\nsurprise and indignation, whereupon he became embarrassed and let go. A\ndream repeated this scene twenty-three years later, with all the details\nof the emotions occurring in it, changing it, however, in this respect,\nthat the dreamer took the passive part instead of the active one, while\nthe person of the schoolmate was replaced by one belonging to the\npresent.\nAs a rule, of course, a childhood scene is represented in the manifest\ndream content only by an allusion, and must be extricated from the dream\nby means of interpretation. The citation of examples of this kind cannot\nhave a very convincing effect, because every guarantee that they are\nexperiences of childhood is lacking; if they belong to an earlier time\nof life, they are no longer recognised by our memory. Justification for\nthe conclusion that such childish experiences generally exist in dreams\nis based upon a great number of factors which become apparent in\npsychoanalytical work, and which seem reliable enough when regarded as a\nwhole. But when, for the purposes of dream interpretation, such\nreferences of dreams to childish experiences are torn from their\ncontext, they will perhaps not make much impression, especially since I\nnever give all the material upon which the interpretation depends.\nHowever, I shall not let this prevent me from giving some examples.\nI. The following dream is from another female patient: _She is in a\nlarge room, in which there are all kinds of machines, perhaps, as she\nimagines, an orthop\u00e6dic institute. She hears that I have no time, and\nthat she must take the treatment along with five others. But she\nresists, and is unwilling to lie down on the bed\u2014or whatever it is\u2014which\nis intended for her. She stands in a corner and waits for me to say \u201cIt\nis not true.\u201d The others, meanwhile, laugh at her, saying it is all\nfoolishness on her part. At the same time it is as if she were called\nupon to make many small squares._\nThe first part of the content of this dream is an allusion to the\ntreatment and a transference on me. The second contains an allusion to a\nchildhood scene; the two portions are connected by the mention of the\nbed. The orthop\u00e6dic institute refers to one of my talks in which I\ncompared the treatment as to its duration and nature with an orthop\u00e6dic\ntreatment. At the beginning of the treatment I had to tell her that _for\nthe present_ I had little time for her, but that later on I would devote\na whole hour to her daily. This aroused in her the old sensitiveness,\nwhich is the chief characteristic of children who are to be hysterical.\nTheir desire for love is insatiable. My patient was the youngest of six\nbrothers and sisters (hence, \u201c_with five others_\u201d), and as such the\nfavourite of her father, but in spite of that she seems to have found\nthat her beloved father devoted too little time and attention to her.\nThe detail of her waiting for me to say \u201cIt is not true,\u201d has the\nfollowing explanation: A tailor\u2019s apprentice had brought her a dress,\nand she had given him the money for it. Then she asked her husband\nwhether she would have to pay the money again if the boy were to lose\nit. To tease her, her husband answered \u201cYes\u201d (the teasing in the dream),\nand she asked again and again, and _waited for him to say_ \u201c_It is not\ntrue._\u201d The thought of the latent dream-content may now be construed as\nfollows: Will she have to pay me the double amount if I devote twice the\ntime to her? a thought which is stingy or filthy. (The uncleanliness of\nchildhood is often replaced in the dream by greediness for money; the\nword filthy here supplies the bridge.) If all that about waiting until I\nshould say, &c., serves as a dream circumlocution for the word \u201cfilthy,\u201d\nthe standing-in-a-corner and not lying down-on-the-bed are in keeping;\nfor these two features are component parts of a scene of childhood, in\nwhich she had soiled her bed, and for punishment was put into a corner,\nwith the warning that papa would not love her any more, and her brothers\nand sisters laughed at her, &c. The little squares refer to her young\nniece, who has shown her the arithmetical trick of writing figures in\nnine squares, I believe it is, in such a way that upon being added\ntogether in any direction they make fifteen.\nII. Here is the dream of a man: _He sees two boys tussling with each\nother, and they are cooper\u2019s boys, as he concludes from the implements\nwhich are lying about; one of the boys has thrown the other down, the\nprostrate one wears ear-rings with blue stones. He hurries after the\nwrongdoer with lifted cane, in order to chastise him. The latter takes\nrefuge with a woman who is standing against a wooden fence, as though it\nwere his mother. She is the wife of a day labourer, and she turns her\nback to the man who is dreaming. At last she faces about and stares at\nhim with a horrible look, so that he runs away in fright; in her eyes\nthe red flesh of the lower lid seems to stand out._\nThe dream has made abundant use of trivial occurrences of the previous\nday. The day before he actually saw two boys on the street, one of whom\nthrew the other one down. When he hurried up to them in order to settle\nthe quarrel, both of them took flight. Coopers\u2019 boys: this is explained\nonly by a subsequent dream, in the analysis of which he used the\nexpression, \u201c_To knock the bottom out of the barrel._\u201d Ear-rings with\nblue stones, according to his observation, are chiefly worn by\nprostitutes. Furthermore, a familiar doggerel rhyme about two boys comes\nup: \u201cThe other boy, his name was Mary\u201d (that is, he was a girl). The\nwoman standing up: after the scene with the two boys, he took a walk on\nthe bank of the Danube, and took advantage of being alone to urinate\n_against a wooden fence_. A little later during his walk, a decently\ndressed elderly lady smiled at him very pleasantly, and wanted to hand\nhim her card with her address.\nSince in the dream the woman stood as he had while urinating, it is a\nquestion of a woman urinating, and this explains the \u201chorrible look,\u201d\nand the prominence of the red flesh, which can only refer to the\ngenitals which gap in squatting. He had seen genitals in his childhood,\nand they had appeared in later recollection as \u201cproud flesh\u201d and as\n\u201cwound.\u201d The dream unites two occasions upon which, as a young boy, the\ndreamer had had opportunity to see the genitals of little girls, in\nthrowing one down, and while another was urinating; and, as is shown by\nanother association, he had kept in memory a punishment or threat of his\nfather\u2019s, called forth by the sexual curiosity which the boy manifested\non these occasions.\nIII. A great mass of childish memories, which have been hastily united\nin a phantasy, is to be found behind the following dream of a young\nlady.\n_She goes out in trepidation, in order to do some shopping. On the\nGraben[BD] she sinks to her knees as though broken down. Many people\ncollect around her, especially the hackney-coach drivers; but no one\nhelps her to get up. She makes many unavailing attempts; finally she\nmust have succeeded, for she is put into a hackney-coach which is to\ntake her home. A large, heavily laden basket (something like a\nmarket-basket) is thrown after her through the window._\nThis is the same woman who is always harassed in her dreams as she was\nharassed when a child. The first situation of the dream is apparently\ntaken from seeing a horse that had fallen, just as \u201cbroken down\u201d points\nto horse-racing. She was a rider in her early years, still earlier she\nwas probably also a horse. Her first childish memory of the\nseventeen-year-old son of the porter, who, being seized on the street by\nan epileptic fit, was brought home in a coach, is connected with the\nidea of falling down. Of this, of course, she has only heard, but the\nidea of epileptic fits and of falling down has obtained great power over\nher phantasies, and has later influenced the form of her own hysterical\nattacks. When a person of the female sex dreams of falling, this almost\nregularly has a sexual significance; she becomes a \u201cfallen woman,\u201d and\nfor the purpose of the dream under consideration this interpretation is\nprobably the least doubtful, for she falls on the Graben, the place in\nVienna which is known as the concourse of prostitutes. The market-basket\nadmits of more than one interpretation; in the sense of refusal (German,\n_Korb_ = basket\u2014snub, refusal), she remembers the many snubs which she\nfirst gave her suitors, and which she later, as she thinks, received\nherself. Here belongs also the detail that _no one will help her up_,\nwhich she herself interprets as being disdained. Furthermore, the\nmarket-basket recalls phantasies that have already appeared in the\ncourse of analysis, in which she imagines she has married far beneath\nher station, and now goes marketing herself. But lastly the\nmarket-basket might be interpreted as the mark of a servant. This\nsuggests further childhood memories\u2014of a cook who was sent away because\nshe stole; she, too, sank to her knees and begged for mercy. The dreamer\nwas at that time twelve years old. Then there is a recollection of a\nchamber-maid, who was dismissed because she had an affair with the\ncoachman of the household, who, incidentally, married her afterwards.\nThis recollection, therefore, gives us a clue to the coachman in the\ndream (who do not, in contrast with what is actually the case, take the\npart of the fallen woman). But there still remains to be explained the\nthrowing of the basket, and the throwing of it through the window. This\ntakes her to the transference of baggage on the railroad, to the\n_Fensterln_,[BE] in the country, and to minor impressions received at a\ncountry resort, of a gentleman throwing some blue plums to a lady\nthrough her window, and of the dreamer\u2019s little sister being frightened\nbecause a cretin who was passing looked in at the window. And now from\nbehind this there emerges an obscure recollection, from her tenth year,\nof a nurse who made love at the country resort with a servant of the\nhousehold, of which the child had opportunity to see something, and who\nwas \u201cfired\u201d (thrown out) (in the dream the opposite: \u201cthrown into\u201d), a\nstory which we had also approached by several other paths. The baggage,\nmoreover, or the trunk of a servant, is disparagingly referred to in\nVienna as \u201cseven plums.\u201d \u201cPack up your seven plums and get out.\u201d\nMy collection, of course, contains an abundant supply of such patients\u2019\ndreams, whose analysis leads to childish impressions that are remembered\nobscurely or not at all, and that often date back to the first three\nyears of life. But it is a mistake to draw conclusions from them which\nare to apply to the dream in general; we are in every case dealing with\nneurotic, particularly with hysterical persons; and the part played by\nchildhood scenes in these dreams might be conditioned by the nature of\nthe neurosis, and not by that of the dream. However, I am struck quite\nas often in the course of interpreting my own dreams, which I do not do\non account of obvious symptoms of disease, by the fact that I\nunsuspectingly come upon a scene of childhood in the latent dream\ncontent, and that a whole series of dreams suddenly falls into line with\nconclusions drawn from childish experiences. I have already given\nexamples of this, and shall give still more upon various occasions.\nPerhaps I cannot close the whole chapter more fittingly than by citing\nseveral of my own dreams, in which recent happenings and long-forgotten\nexperiences of childhood appear together as sources of dreams.\nI. After I have been travelling and have gone to bed hungry and tired,\nthe great necessities of life begin to assert their claims in sleep, and\nI dream as follows: _I go into a kitchen to order some pastry. Here\nthree women are standing, one of whom is the hostess, and is turning\nsomething in her hand as though she were making dumplings. She answers\nthat I must wait until she has finished_ (not distinctly as a speech).\n_I become impatient and go away insulted. I put on an overcoat; but the\nfirst one which I try is too long. I take it off, and am somewhat\nastonished to find that it has fur trimming. A second one has sewn into\nit a long strip of cloth with Turkish drawings. A stranger with a long\nface and a short pointed beard comes up and prevents me from putting it\non, declaring that it belongs to him. I now show him that it is\nembroidered all over in Turkish fashion. He asks, \u201cWhat business are the\nTurkish (drawings, strips of cloth ...) of yours?\u201d But we then become\nquite friendly with each other._\nIn the analysis of this dream there occurs to me quite unexpectedly the\nnovel which I read, that is to say, which I began with the end of the\nfirst volume, when I was perhaps thirteen years old. I have never known\nthe name of the novel or of its author, but the conclusion remains\nvividly in my memory. The hero succumbs to insanity, and continually\ncalls the names of the three women that have signified the greatest good\nand ill fortune for him during life. P\u00e9lagie is one of these names. I\nstill do not know what to make of this name in the analysis. \u00c0 propos of\nthe three women there now come to the surface the three Parc\u00e6 who spin\nthe fate of man, and I know that one of the three women, the hostess in\nthe dream, is the mother who gives life, and who, moreover, as in my\ncase, gives the first nourishment to the living creature. Love and\nhunger meet at the mother\u2019s breast. A young man\u2014so runs an anecdote\u2014who\nbecame a great admirer of womanly beauty, once when the conversation\nturned upon a beautiful wet nurse who had nourished him as a child,\nexpressed himself to the effect that he was sorry that he had not taken\nbetter advantage of his opportunity at the time. I am in the habit of\nusing the anecdote to illustrate the factor of subsequence in the\nmechanism of psychoneuroses.... One of the Parc\u00e6, then, is rubbing the\npalms of her hands together as though she were making dumplings. A\nstrange occupation for one of the Fates, which is urgently in need of an\nexplanation! This is now found in another and earlier childhood memory.\nWhen I was six years old, and was receiving my first instructions from\nmy mother, I was asked to believe that we are made of earth, and that\ntherefore we must return to earth. But this did not suit me, and I\ndoubted her teaching. Thereupon my mother rubbed the palms of her hands\ntogether\u2014just as in making dumplings, except that there was no dough\nbetween them\u2014and showed me the blackish scales of epidermis which were\nthus rubbed off as a proof that it is earth of which we are made. My\nastonishment at this demonstration _ad oculos_ was without limit, and I\nacquiesced in the idea which I was later to hear expressed in words:\n\u201cThou owest nature a death.\u201d[BF] Thus the women are really Parc\u00e6 whom I\nvisit in the kitchen, as I have done so often in my childhood years when\nI was hungry, and when my mother used to order me to wait until lunch\nwas ready. And now for the dumplings! At least one of my teachers at the\nUniversity, the very one to whom I am indebted for my histological\nknowledge (epidermis), might be reminded by the name Knoedl (German,\n_Knoedel_ = dumplings) of a person whom he had to prosecute for\ncommitting a plagiarism of his writings. To commit plagiarism, to\nappropriate anything one can get, even though it belongs to another,\nobviously leads to the second part of the dream, in which I am treated\nlike a certain overcoat thief, who for a time plied his trade in the\nauditoria. I wrote down the expression plagiarism\u2014without any\nreason\u2014because it presented itself to me, and now I perceive that it\nmust belong to the latent dream-content, because it will serve as a\nbridge between different parts of the manifest dream-content. The chain\nof associations\u2014P\u00e9lagie\u2014plagiarism\u2014plagiostomi[BG] (sharks)\u2014fish\nbladder\u2014connects the old novel with the affair of Knoedl and with the\novercoats (German, _\u00dcberzieher_ = thing drawn over\u2014overcoat or condom),\nwhich obviously refer to an object belonging to the technique of sexual\nlife.[BH] This, it is true, is a very forced and irrational connection,\nbut it is nevertheless one which I could not establish in waking life if\nit had not been already established by the activity of the dream.\nIndeed, as though nothing were sacred for this impulse to force\nconnections, the beloved name, Bruecke (bridge of words, see above), now\nserves to remind me of the institution in which I spent my happiest\nhours as a student, quite without any cares (\u201cSo you will ever find more\npleasure at the breasts of knowledge without measure\u201d), in the most\ncomplete contrast to the urgent desires which vex me while I dream. And\nfinally there comes to the surface the recollection of another dear\nteacher, whose name again sounds like something to eat (Fleischl\u2014German,\n_Fleisch_ = meat\u2014like Knoedl), and of a pathetic scene, in which the\nscales of epidermis play a part (mother\u2014hostess), and insanity (the\nnovel), and a remedy from the Latin kitchen which numbs the sensation of\nhunger, to wit, cocaine.\nIn this manner I could follow the intricate trains of thought still\nfurther, and could fully explain the part of the dream which is missing\nin the analysis; but I must refrain, because the personal sacrifices\nwhich it would require are too great. I shall merely take up one of the\nthreads, which will serve to lead us directly to the dream thoughts that\nlie at the bottom of the confusion. The stranger, with the long face and\npointed beard, who wants to prevent me from putting on the overcoat, has\nthe features of a tradesman at Spalato, of whom my wife made ample\npurchases of Turkish cloths. His name was Popovic\u0313, a suspicious name,\nwhich, by the way, has given the humorist Stettenheim a chance to make a\nsignificant remark: \u201cHe told me his name, and blushingly shook my\nhand.\u201d[BI] Moreover, there is the same abuse of names as above with\nP\u00e9lagie, Knoedl, Bruecke, Fleischl. That such playing with names is\nchildish nonsense can be asserted without fear of contradiction; if I\nindulge in it, this indulgence amounts to an act of retribution, for my\nown name has numberless times fallen a victim to such weak-minded\nattempts at humour. Goethe once remarked how sensitive a man is about\nhis name with which, as with his skin, he feels that he has grown up,\nwhereupon Herder composed the following on his name:\n\u201cThou who art born of _gods_, of _Goths_, or of _Kot_ (mud)\u2014\nThy _god_like images, too, are dust.\u201d\nI perceive that this digression about the abuse of names was only\nintended to prepare for this complaint. But let us stop here.... The\npurchase at Spalato reminds me of another one at Cattaro, where I was\ntoo cautious, and missed an opportunity for making some desirable\nacquisitions. (Missing an opportunity at the breast of the nurse, see\nabove.) Another dream thought, occasioned in the dreamer by the\nsensation of hunger, is as follows: _One should let nothing which one\ncan have escape, even if a little wrong is done; no opportunity should\nbe missed, life is so short, death inevitable._ Owing to the fact that\nthis also has a sexual significance, and that desire is unwilling to\nstop at a wrong, this philosophy of _carpe diem_ must fear the censor\nand must hide behind a dream. This now makes articulate counter-thoughts\nof all kinds, recollections of a time when spiritual food alone was\nsufficient for the dreamer; it suggests repressions of every kind, and\neven threats of disgusting sexual punishments.\nII. A second dream requires a longer preliminary statement:\nI have taken a car to the West Station in order to begin a vacation\njourney to the Aussee, and I reach the station in time for the train to\nIschl, which leaves earlier. Here I see Count Thun, who is again going\nto see the Emperor at Ischl. In spite of the rain, he has come in an\nopen carriage, has passed out at once through the door for local trains,\nand has motioned back the gate-keeper, who does not know him and who\nwants to take his ticket, with a little wave of his hand. After the\ntrain to Ischl has left, I am told to leave the platform and go back\ninto the hot waiting-room; but with difficulty I secure permission to\nremain. I pass the time in watching the people who make use of bribes to\nsecure a compartment; I make up my mind to insist on my rights\u2014that is,\nto demand the same privilege. Meanwhile I sing something to myself,\nwhich I afterwards recognise to be the aria from Figaro\u2019s Wedding:\n\u201cIf my lord Count wishes to try a dance,\nTry a dance,\nLet him but say so,\nI\u2019ll play him a tune.\u201d\n(Possibly another person would not have recognised the song.)\nDuring the whole afternoon I have been in an insolent, combative mood;\nI have spoken roughly to the waiter and the cabman, I hope without\nhurting their feelings; now all kinds of bold and revolutionary\nthoughts come into my head, of a kind suited to the words of Figaro\nand the comedy of Beaumarchais, which I had seen at the Com\u00e9die\nFran\u00e7aise. The speech about great men who had taken the trouble to be\nborn; the aristocratic prerogative, which Count Almaviva wants to\napply in the case of Susan; the jokes which our malicious journalists\nof the Opposition make upon the name of Count Thun (German, _thun_ =\ndoing) by calling him Count Do-Nothing. I really do not envy him; he\nhas now a difficult mission with the Emperor, and I am the real Count\nDo-Nothing, for I am taking a vacation. With this, all kinds of\ncheerful plans for the vacation. A gentleman now arrives who is known\nto me as a representative of the Government at the medical\nexaminations, and who has won the flattering nickname of \u201cGovernmental\nbed-fellow\u201d by his activities in this capacity. By insisting on his\nofficial station he secures half of a first-class compartment, and I\nhear one guard say to the other: \u201cWhere are we going to put the\ngentleman with the first-class half-compartment?\u201d A pretty\nfavouritism; I am paying for a whole first-class compartment. Now I\nget a whole compartment for myself, but not in a through coach, so\nthat there is no toilet at my disposal during the night. My complaints\nto the guard are without result; I get even by proposing that at least\nthere be a hole made in the floor of this compartment for the possible\nneeds of the travellers. I really awake at a quarter of three in the\nmorning with a desire to urinate, having had the following dream:\nCrowd of people, meeting of students.... _A certain Count (Thun or\nTaafe) is making a speech. Upon being asked to say something about the\nGermans, he declares with contemptuous mien that their favourite flower\nis Colt\u2019s-foot, and then puts something like a torn leaf, really the\ncrumpled skeleton of a leaf, into his buttonhole. I make a start, I make\na start then,[BJ] but I am surprised at this idea of mine._ Then more\nindistinctly: _It seems as though it were the vestibule (Aula), the\nexits are jammed, as though it were necessary to flee. I make my way\nthrough a suite of handsomely furnished rooms, apparently governmental\nchambers, with furniture of a colour which is between brown and violet,\nand at last I come to a passage where a housekeeper, an elderly, fat\nwoman (Frauenzimmer), is seated. I try to avoid talking to her, but\napparently she thinks I have a right to pass because she asks whether\nshe shall accompany me with the lamp. I signify to her to tell her that\nshe is to remain standing on the stairs, and in this I appear to myself\nvery clever, for avoiding being watched at last. I am downstairs now,\nand I find a narrow, steep way along which I go._\nAgain indistinctly.... _It is as if my second task were to get away out\nof the city, as my earlier was to get out of the house. I am riding in a\none-horse carriage, and tell the driver to take me to a railway station.\n\u201cI cannot ride with you on the tracks,\u201d I say, after he has made the\nobjection that I have tired him out. Here it seems as though I had\nalready driven with him along a course which is ordinarily traversed on\nthe railroad. The stations are crowded; I consider whether I shall go to\nKrems or to Znaim, but I think that the court will be there, and I\ndecide in favour of Graz or something of the sort. Now I am seated in\nthe coach, which is something like a street-car, and I have in my\nbuttonhole a long braided thing, on which are violet-brown violets of\nstiff material, which attracts the attention of many people. Here the\nscene breaks off._\n_I am again in front of the railroad station, but I am with a elderly\ngentleman. I invent a scheme for remaining unrecognised, but I also see\nthis plan already carried out. Thinking and experiencing are here, as it\nwere, the same thing. He pretends to be blind, at least in one eye, and\nI hold a male urinal in front of him (which we have had to buy in the\ncity or did buy), I am thus a sick attendant, and have to give him the\nurinal because he is blind. If the conductor sees us in this position,\nhe must pass us by without drawing attention. At the same time the\nattitude of the person mentioned is visually observed._ Then I awake\nwith a desire to urinate.\nThe whole dream seems a sort of phantasy, which takes the dreamer back\nto the revolutionary year 1848, the memory of which had been renewed by\nthe anniversary year 1898, as well as by a little excursion to Wachau,\nwhere I had become acquainted with Emmersdorf, a town which I wrongly\nsupposed to be the resting-place of the student leader Fischof, to whom\nseveral features of the dream content might refer. The thought\nassociations then lead me to England, to the house of my brother, who\nwas accustomed jokingly to tell his wife of \u201cFifty years ago,\u201d according\nto the title of a poem by Lord Tennyson, whereupon the children were in\nthe habit of correcting: \u201cFifteen years ago.\u201d This phantasy, however,\nwhich subtilely attaches itself to the thoughts which the sight of the\nCount Thun has given rise to, is only like the fa\u00e7ade of Italian\nchurches which is superimposed without being organically connected with\nthe building behind it; unlike these fa\u00e7ades, however, the phantasy is\nfilled with gaps and confused, and the parts from within break through\nat many places. The first situation of the dream is concocted from\nseveral scenes, into which I am able to separate it. The arrogant\nattitude of the Count in the dream is copied from a scene at the\nGymnasium which took place in my fifteenth year. We had contrived a\nconspiracy against an unpopular and ignorant teacher, the leading spirit\nin which was a schoolmate who seems to have taken Henry VIII. of England\nas his model. It fell to me to carry out the _coup-d\u2019\u00e9tat_, and a\ndiscussion of the importance of the Danube (German _Donau_) for Austria\n(Wachau!) was the occasion upon which matters came to open indignation.\nA fellow-conspirator was the only aristocratic schoolmate whom we had\u2014he\nwas called the \u201cgiraffe\u201d on account of his conspicuous longitudinal\ndevelopment\u2014and he stood just like the Count in the dream, while he was\nbeing reprimanded by the tyrant of the school, the Professor of the\nGerman language. The explanation of the favourite flower and the putting\ninto the buttonhole of something which again must have been a flower\n(which recalls the orchids, which I had brought to a lady friend on the\nsame day, and besides that the rose of Jericho) prominently recalls the\nscene in Shakespeare\u2019s historical plays which opens the civil wars of\nthe Red and the White Roses; the mention of Henry VIII. has opened the\nway to this reminiscence. It is not very far now from roses to red and\nwhite carnations. Meanwhile two little rhymes, the one German, the other\nSpanish, insinuate themselves into the analysis: \u201cRoses, tulips,\ncarnations, all flowers fade,\u201d and \u201cIsabelita, no llores que se\nmarchitan las flores.\u201d The Spanish is taken from _Figaro_. Here in\nVienna white carnations have become the insignia of the Anti-Semites,\nthe red ones of the Social Democrats. Behind this is the recollection of\nan anti-Semitic challenge during a railway trip in beautiful Saxony\n(Anglo-Saxon). The third scene contributing to the formation of the\nfirst situation in the dream takes place in my early student life. There\nwas a discussion in the German students\u2019 club about the relation of\nphilosophy to the general sciences. A green youth, full of the\nmaterialistic doctrine, I thrust myself forward and defended a very\none-sided view. Thereupon a sagacious older school-fellow, who has since\nshown his capacity for leading men and organising the masses, and who,\nmoreover, bears a name belonging to the animal kingdom, arose and called\nus down thoroughly; he too, he said, had herded swine in his youth, and\nhad come back repentant to the house of his father. I started up (as in\nthe dream), became very uncivil, and answered that since I knew he had\nherded swine, I was not surprised at the tone of his discourse. (In the\ndream I am surprised at my national German sentiment.) There was great\ncommotion; and the demand came from all sides that I take back what I\nhad said, but I remained steadfast. The man who had been insulted was\ntoo sensible to take the advice, which was given him, to send a\nchallenge, and let the matter drop.\nThe remaining elements of this scene of the dream are of more remote\norigin. What is the meaning of the Count\u2019s proclaiming the colt\u2019s foot?\nHere I must consult my train of associations. Colt\u2019s-foot (German:\n_Huflattich_)\u2014lattice\u2014lettuce\u2014salad-dog (the dog that grudges others\nwhat he cannot eat himself). Here plenty of opprobrious epithets may be\ndiscerned: Gir-affe (German _Affe_ = monkey, ape), pig, sow, dog; I\nmight even find means to arrive at donkey, on a detour by way of a name,\nand thus again at contempt for an academic teacher. Furthermore I\ntranslate colt\u2019s-foot (_Huflattich_)\u2014I do not know how correctly\u2014by\n\u201cpisse-en-lit.\u201d I got this idea from Zola\u2019s _Germinal_, in which\nchildren are ordered to bring salad of this kind. The dog\u2014_chien_\u2014has a\nname sounding like the major function (_chier_, as _pisser_ stands for\nthe minor one). Now we shall soon have before us the indecent in all\nthree of its categories; for in the same _Germinal_, which has a lot to\ndo with the future revolution there is described a very peculiar\ncontest, depending upon the production of gaseous excretions, called\nflatus.[BK] And now I must remark how the way to this flatus has been\nfor a long while preparing, beginning with the flowers, and proceeding\nto the Spanish rhyme of Isabelita to Ferdinand and Isabella, and, by way\nof Henry VIII., to English history at the time of the expedition of the\nArmada against England, after the victorious termination of which the\nEnglish struck a medal with the inscription: \u201c_Afflavit_ et dissipati\nsunt,\u201d for the storm had scattered the Spanish fleet. I had thought of\ntaking this phrase for the title of a chapter on \u201cTherapeutics\u201d\u2014to be\nmeant half jokingly\u2014if I should ever have occasion to give a detailed\naccount of my conception and treatment of hysteria.\nI cannot give such a detailed solution of the second scene of the dream,\nout of regard for the censor. For at this point I put myself in the\nplace of a certain eminent gentleman of that revolutionary period, who\nalso had an adventure with an eagle, who is said to have suffered from\nincontinence of the bowels, and the like; and I believe I _should not be\njustified at this point in passing_ the censor, although it was an aulic\ncouncillor (_aula_, _consilarius aulicus_) who told me the greater part\nof these stories. The allusion to the suite of rooms in the dream\nrelates to the private car of his Excellency, into which I had\nopportunity to look for a moment; but it signifies, as so often in\ndreams, a woman (Frauenzimmer; German _Zimmer_\u2014room is appended to\n_Frauen_\u2014woman, in order to imply a slight amount of contempt).[BL] In\nthe person of the housekeeper I give scant recognition to an intelligent\nelderly lady for the entertainment and the many good stories which I\nhave enjoyed at her house.... The feature of the lamp goes back to\nGrillparzer, who notes a charming experience of a similar nature, which\nhe afterwards made use of in \u201cHero and Leander\u201d (the billows of the\nocean and of love\u2014the Armada and the storm).[BM]\nI must also forgo detailed analysis of the two remaining portions of the\ndream; I shall select only those elements which lead to two childhood\nscenes, for the sake of which alone I have taken up the dream. The\nreader will guess that it is sexual matter which forces me to this\nsuppression; but he need not be content with this explanation. Many\nthings which must be treated as secrets in the presence of others are\nnot treated as such with one\u2019s self, and here it is not a question of\nconsiderations inducing me to hide the solution, but of motives of the\ninner censor concealing the real content of the dream from myself. I may\nsay, then, that the analysis shows these three portions of the dream to\nbe impertinent boasting, the exuberance of an absurd grandiose idea\nwhich has long since been suppressed in my waking life, which, however,\ndares show itself in the manifest dream content by one or two\nprojections (_I seem clever to myself_), and which makes the arrogant\nmood of the evening before the dream perfectly intelligible. It is\nboasting, indeed, in all departments; thus the mention of Graz refers to\nthe phrase: What is the price of Graz? which we are fond of using when\nwe feel over-supplied with money. Whoever will recall Master Rabelais\u2019s\nunexcelled description of the \u201cLife and Deeds of Gargantua and his Son\nPantagruel,\u201d will be able to supply the boastful content intimated in\nthe first portion of the dream. The following belongs to the two\nchildhood scenes which have been promised. I had bought a new trunk for\nthis journey, whose colour, a brownish violet, appears in the dream\nseveral times. (Violet-brown violets made of stiff material, next to a\nthing which is called \u201cgirl-catcher\u201d\u2014the furniture in the governmental\nchambers). That something new attracts people\u2019s attention is a\nwell-known belief of children. Now I have been told the following story\nof my childhood; I remember hearing the story rather than the occurrence\nitself. I am told that at the age of two I still occasionally wetted my\nbed, that I was often reproached on this subject, and that I consoled my\nfather by promising to buy him a beautiful new red bed in N. (the\nnearest large city). (Hence the detail inserted in the dream that _we\nbought the urinal in the city or had to buy it_; one must keep one\u2019s\npromises. Attention is further called to the identity of the male urinal\nand the feminine trunk, box). All the megalomania of the child is\ncontained in this promise. The significance of the dream of difficulty\nin urinating in the case of the child has been already considered in the\ninterpretation of an earlier dream (_cf._ the dream on p. 145).\nNow there was another domestic occurrence, when I was seven or eight\nyears old, which I remember very well. One evening, before going to bed\nI had disregarded the dictates of discretion not to satisfy my wants in\nthe bedroom of my parents and in their presence, and in his reprimand\nfor this delinquency my father made the remark: \u201cThat boy will never\namount to anything.\u201d It must have terribly mortified my ambition, for\nallusions to this scene return again and again in my dreams, and are\nregularly coupled with enumerations of my accomplishments and successes,\nas though I wanted to say: \u201cYou see, I have amounted to something after\nall.\u201d Now this childhood scene furnishes the elements for the last image\nof the dream, in which of course, the r\u00f4les are interchanged for the\nsake of revenge. The elderly man, obviously my father, for the blindness\nin one eye signifies his glaucoma[BN] on one side is now urinating\nbefore me as I once urinated before him. In glaucoma I refer to cocaine,\nwhich stood my father in good stead in his operation, as though I had\nthereby fulfilled my promises. Besides that I make sport of him; since\nhe is blind I must hold the urinal in front of him, and I gloat over\nallusions to my discoveries in the theory of hysteria, of which I am so\nproud.[BO]\nIf the two childhood scenes of urinating are otherwise closely connected\nwith the desire for greatness, their rehabilitation on the trip to the\nAussee was further favoured by the accidental circumstance that my\ncompartment had no water-closet, and that I had to expect embarrassment\non the ride as actually happened in the morning. I awoke with the\nsensation of a bodily need. I suppose one might be inclined to credit\nthese sensations with being the actual stimulus of the dream; I should,\nhowever, prefer a different conception\u2014namely, that it was the dream\nthoughts which gave rise to the desire to urinate. It is quite unusual\nfor me to be disturbed in sleep by any need, at least at the time of\nthis awakening, a quarter of four in the morning. I may forestall\nfurther objection by remarking that I have hardly ever felt a desire to\nurinate after awakening early on other journeys made under more\ncomfortable circumstances. Moreover, I can leave this point undecided\nwithout hurting my argument.\nSince I have learned, further, from experience in dream analysis that\nthere always remain important trains of thought proceeding from dreams\nwhose interpretation at first seems complete (because the sources of the\ndream and the actuation of the wish are easily demonstrable), trains of\nthought reaching back into earliest childhood, I have been forced to ask\nmyself whether this feature does not constitute an essential condition\nof dreaming. If I were to generalise this thesis, a connection with what\nhas been recently experienced would form a part of the manifest content\nof every dream and a connection with what has been most remotely\nexperienced, of its latent content; and I can actually show in the\nanalysis of hysteria that in a true sense these remote experiences have\nremained recent up to the present time. But this conjecture seems still\nvery difficult to prove; I shall probably have to return to the part\nplayed by the earliest childhood experiences, in another connection\n(Chapter VII.).\nOf the three peculiarities of dream memory considered at the beginning,\none\u2014the preference for the unimportant in the dream content\u2014has been\nsatisfactorily explained by tracing it back to dream disfigurement. We\nhave been able to establish the existence of the other two\u2014the selection\nof recent and of infantile material\u2014but we have found it impossible to\nexplain them by the motive of dream. Let us keep in mind these two\ncharacteristics, which still remain to be explained or evaluated; a\nplace for them will have to be found elsewhere, either in the psychology\nof the sleeping state, or in the discussion of the structure of the\npsychic apparatus which we shall undertake later, after we have learned\nthat the inner nature of the apparatus may be observed through dream\ninterpretation as though through a window.\nJust here I may emphasize another result of the last few dream analyses.\nThe dream often appears ambiguous; not only may several\nwish-fulfilments, as the examples show, be united in it, but one meaning\nor one wish-fulfilment may also conceal another, until at the bottom one\ncomes upon the fulfilment of a wish from the earliest period of\nchildhood; and here too, it may be questioned whether \u201coften\u201d in this\nsentence may not more correctly be replaced by \u201cregularly.\u201d\n(_c_) _Somatic Sources of Dreams_\nIf the attempt be made to interest the cultured layman in the problems\nof dreaming, and if, with this end in view, he be asked the question\nfrom what source dreams originate according to his opinion, it is\ngenerally found that the person thus interrogated thinks himself in\nassured possession of a part of the solution. He immediately thinks of\nthe influence which a disturbed or impeded digestion (\u201cDreams come from\nthe stomach\u201d), accidental bodily position, and little occurrences during\nsleep, exercise upon the formation of dreams, and he seems not to\nsuspect that even after the consideration of all these factors there\nstill remains something unexplained.\nWe have explained at length in the introductory chapter (p. 16), what a\nr\u00f4le in the formation of dreams the scientific literature credits to the\naccount of somatic exciting sources, so that we need here only recall\nthe results of this investigation. We have seen that three kinds of\nsomatic exciting sources are distinguished, objective sensory stimuli\nwhich proceed from external objects, the inner states of excitation of\nthe sensory organs having only a subjective basis, and the bodily\nstimuli which originate internally; and we have noticed the inclination\non the part of the authors to force the psychic sources of the dream\ninto the background or to disregard them altogether in favour of these\nsomatic sources of stimulation (p. 32).\nIn testing the claims which are made on behalf of these classes of\nsomatic sources of stimulation, we have discovered that the significance\nof the objective stimuli of the sensory organs\u2014whether accidental\nstimuli during sleep or those stimuli which cannot be excluded from our\ndormant psychic life\u2014has been definitely established by numerous\nobservations and is confirmed by experiments (p. 18); we have seen that\nthe part played by subjective sensory stimuli appears to be demonstrated\nby the return of hypnogogic sensory images in dreams, and that although\nthe referring of these dream images and ideas, in the broadest sense, to\ninternal bodily stimulation is not demonstrable in every detail, it can\nbe supported by the well-known influence which an exciting state of the\ndigestive, urinary, and sexual organs exercise upon the contents of our\ndreams.\n\u201cNerve stimulus\u201d and \u201cbodily stimulus,\u201d then, would be the somatic\nsources of the dream\u2014that is, the only sources whatever of the dream,\naccording to several authors.\nBut we have already found a number of doubts, which seem to attack not\nso much the correctness of the somatic theory of stimulation as its\nadequacy.\nHowever certain all the representatives of this theory may have felt\nabout the actual facts on which it is based\u2014especially in case of the\naccidental and external nerve stimuli, which may be recognised in the\ncontent of the dream without any trouble\u2014nevertheless none of them has\nbeen able to avoid the admission that the abundant ideal content of\ndreams does not admit of explanation by external nerve-stimuli alone.\nMiss Mary Whiton Calkins[12] has tested her own dreams and those of\nanother person for a period of six weeks with this idea in mind, and has\nfound only from 13\u00b72 per cent. to 6\u00b77 per cent. in which the element of\nexternal sensory perception was demonstrable; only two cases in the\ncollection could be referred to organic sensations. Statistics here\nconfirm what a hasty glance at our own experience might have led us to\nsuspect.\nThe decision has been made repeatedly to distinguish the \u201cdream of nerve\nstimulus\u201d from the other forms of the dream as a well-established\nsub-species. Spitta[64] divided dreams into dreams of nerve stimulus and\nassociation dreams. But the solution clearly remained unsatisfactory as\nlong as the link between the somatic sources of dreams and their ideal\ncontent could not be demonstrated.\nBesides the first objection, of the inadequate frequency of external\nexciting sources, there arises as a second objection the inadequate\nexplanation of dreams offered by the introduction of this sort of dream\nsources. The representatives of the theory accordingly must explain two\nthings, in the first place, why the external stimulus in the dream is\nnever recognised according to its real nature, but is regularly mistaken\nfor something else (_cf._ the alarm-clock dreams, p. 22), and secondly,\nwhy the reaction of the receiving mind to this misrecognised stimulus\nshould result so indeterminately and changefully. As an answer to these\nquestions, we have heard from Str\u00fcmpell[66] that the mind, as a result\nof its being turned away from the outer world during sleep, is not\ncapable of giving correct interpretation to the objective sensory\nstimulus, but is forced to form illusions on the basis of the indefinite\nincitements from many directions. As expressed in his own words (p.\n108):\n\u201cAs soon as a sensation, a sensational complex, a feeling, or a psychic\nprocess in general, arises in the mind during sleep from an outer or\ninner nerve-stimulus, and is perceived by the mind, this process calls\nup sensory images, that is to say, earlier perceptions, either\nunembellished or with the psychic values belonging to them, from the\nrange of waking experiences, of which the mind has remained in\npossession. It seems to collect about itself, as it were, a greater or\nless number of such images, from which the impression which originates\nfrom the nerve-stimulus receives its psychic value. It is usually said\nhere, as the idiom does of waking thought, that the mind _interprets_\nimpressions of nerve-stimuli in sleep. The result of this interpretation\nis the so-called nerve-stimulus dream\u2014that is to say, a dream whose\ncomposition is conditioned by the fact that a nerve-stimulus brings\nabout its effect in psychic life according to the laws of reproduction.\u201d\nThe opinion of Wundt[76] agrees in all essentials with this theory. He\nsays that the ideas in the dream are probably the result, for the most\npart, of sensory stimuli, especially of those of general sensation, and\nare therefore mostly phantastic illusions\u2014probably memory presentations\nwhich are only partly pure, and which have been raised to\nhallucinations. Str\u00fcmpell has found an excellent simile (p. 84). It is\nas \u201cif the ten fingers of a person ignorant of music should stray over\nthe keyboard of an instrument\u201d\u2014to illustrate the relation between dream\ncontent and dream stimuli, which follows from this theory. The\nimplication is that the dream does not appear as a psychic phenomenon,\noriginating from psychic motives, but as the result of a physiological\nstimulus, which is expressed in psychic symptomology, because the\napparatus which is affected by the stimulus is not capable of any other\nexpression. Upon a similar assumption is based, for example, the\nexplanation of compulsive ideas which Meynert tried to give by means of\nthe famous simile of the dial on which individual figures are prominent\nbecause they are in more marked relief.\nHowever popular this theory of somatic dream stimuli may have become,\nand however seductive it may seem, it is nevertheless easy to show the\nweak point in it. Every somatic dream stimulus which provokes the\npsychic apparatus to interpretation through the formation of illusions,\nis capable of giving rise to an incalculable number of such attempts at\ninterpretation; it can thus attain representation in the dream content\nby means of an extraordinary number of different ideas. But the theory\nof Str\u00fcmpell and Wundt is incapable of instancing any motive which has\ncontrol over the relation between the external stimulus and the dream\nidea which has been selected to interpret it, and therefore of\nexplaining the \u201cpeculiar choice\u201d which the stimuli \u201coften enough make in\nthe course of their reproductive activity\u201d (Lipps, _Grundtatsachen des\nSeelenlebens_, p. 170). Other objections may be directed against the\nfundamental assumption of the whole theory of illusions\u2014the assumption\nthat during sleep the mind is not in a condition to recognise the real\nnature of the objective sensory stimuli. The old physiologist Burdach[8]\nproves to us that the mind is quite capable even during sleep of\ninterpreting correctly the sensory impressions which reach it, and of\nreacting in accordance with the correct interpretation. He establishes\nthis by showing that it is possible to exempt certain impressions which\nseem important to the individuals, from the neglect of sleeping (nurse\nand child), and that one is more surely awakened by one\u2019s own name than\nby an indifferent auditory impression, all of which presupposes, of\ncourse, that the mind distinguishes among sensations, even in sleep\n(Chapter I., p. 41). Burdach infers from these observations that it is\nnot an incapability of interpreting sensory stimuli in the sleeping\nstate which must be assumed, but a lack of interest in them. The same\narguments which Burdach used in 1830, later reappear unchanged in the\nworks of Lipps in the year 1883, where they are employed for the purpose\nof attacking the theory of somatic stimuli. According to this the mind\nseems to be like the sleeper in the anecdote, who, upon being asked,\n\u201cAre you asleep?\u201d answers \u201cNo,\u201d and upon being again addressed with the\nwords, \u201cThen lend me ten florins,\u201d takes refuge in the excuse: \u201cI am\nasleep.\u201d\nThe inadequacy of the theory of somatic dream stimuli may also be\ndemonstrated in another manner. Observations show that I am not urged to\ndream by external stimulations, even if these stimulations appear in the\ndream as soon as, and in case that, I dream. In response to the tactile\nor pressure stimulus which I get while sleeping, various reactions are\nat my disposal. I can overlook it and discover only upon awakening that\nmy leg has been uncovered or my arm under pressure; pathology shows the\nmost numerous examples where powerfully acting sensory and motor stimuli\nof different sorts remain without effect during sleep. I can perceive a\nsensation during sleep through and through sleep, as it were, which\nhappens as a rule with painful stimuli, but without weaving the pain\ninto the texture of the dream; thirdly, I can awaken on account of the\nstimulus in order to obviate it. Only as a fourth possible reaction, I\nmay be impelled to dream by a nerve stimulus; but the other\npossibilities are realised at least as often as that of dream formation.\nThis could not be the case if the _motive for dreaming did not lie\noutside of the somatic sources of dreams_.\nTaking proper account of the defect in the explanation of dreams by\nsomatic stimuli which has just been shown, other authors\u2014Scherner,[58]\nwho was joined by the philosopher Volkelt[72]\u2014have tried to determine\nmore exactly the psychic activities which cause the variegated dream\nimages to arise from the somatic stimuli, and have thus transferred the\nessential nature of dreams back to the province of the mind, and to that\nof psychic activity. Scherner not only gave a poetically appreciative,\nglowing and vivid description of the psychic peculiarities which develop\nin the course of dream formation; he also thought he had guessed the\nprinciple according to which the mind proceeds with the stimuli that are\nat its disposal. The dream activity, according to Scherner\u2014after\nphantasy has been freed from the shackles imposed upon it during the\nday, and has been given free rein\u2014strives to represent symbolically the\nnature of the organ from which the stimulus proceeds. Thus we have a\nkind of dream-book as a guide for the interpretation of dreams, by means\nof which bodily sensations, the conditions of the organs and of the\nstimuli may be inferred from dream images. \u201cThus the image of a cat\nexpresses an angry discontented mood, the image of a light-coloured bit\nof smooth pastry the nudity of the body. The human body as a whole is\npictured as a house by the phantasy of the dream, and each individual\norgan of the body as a part of the house. In \u2018toothache-dreams\u2019 a high\nvaulted vestibule corresponds to the mouth and a stair to the descent of\nthe gullet to the alimentary canal; in the \u2018headache-dream\u2019 the ceiling\nof a room which is covered with disgusting reptile-like spiders is\nchosen to denote the upper part of the head\u201d (Volkelt, p. 39). \u201cSeveral\ndifferent symbols are used by the dream for the same organ, thus the\nbreathing lungs find their symbol in an oven filled with flames and with\na roaring draught, the heart in hollow chests and baskets, and the\nbladder in round, bag-shaped objects or anything else hollow. It is\nespecially important that at the end of a dream the stimulating organ or\nits function be represented undisguised and usually on the dreamer\u2019s own\nbody. Thus the \u2018toothache-dream\u2019 usually ends by the dreamer drawing a\ntooth from his own mouth\u201d (p. 35). It cannot be said that this theory\nhas found much favour with the authors. Above all, it seems extravagant;\nthere has been no inclination even to discover the small amount of\njustification to which it may, in my opinion, lay claim. As may be seen,\nit leads to a revival of the dream interpretation by means of symbolism,\nwhich the ancients used, except that the source from which the\ninterpretation is to be taken is limited to the human body. The lack of\na technique of interpretation which is scientifically comprehensible\nmust seriously limit the applicability of Scherner\u2019s theory.\nArbitrariness in dream interpretation seems in no wise excluded,\nespecially since a stimulus may be expressed by several representations\nin the content of the dream; thus Scherner\u2019s associate, Volkelt, has\nalready found it impossible to confirm the representation of the body as\na house. Another objection is that here again dream activity is\nattributed to the mind as a useless and aimless activity, since\naccording to the theory in question the mind is content with forming\nphantasies about the stimulus with which it is concerned, without even\nremotely contemplating anything like a discharge of the stimulus.\nBut Scherner\u2019s theory of the symbolisation of bodily stimuli by the\ndream receives a heavy blow from another objection. These bodily stimuli\nare present at all times, and according to general assumption the mind\nis more accessible to them during sleep than in waking. It is thus\nincomprehensible why the mind does not dream continually throughout the\nnight, and why it does not dream every night and about all the organs.\nIf one attempts to avoid this objection by making the condition that\nespecial stimuli must proceed from the eye, the ear, the teeth, the\nintestines in order to arouse dream activity, one is confronted by the\ndifficulty of proving that this increase of stimulation is objective,\nwhich is possible only in a small number of cases. If the dream of\nflying is a symbolisation of the upward and downward motion of the\npulmonary lobes, either this dream, as has already been remarked by\nStr\u00fcmpell, would be dreamt much oftener, or an accentuation of the\nfunction of breathing during the dream would have to be demonstrable.\nStill another case is possible\u2014the most probable of all\u2014that now and\nthen special motives directing attention to the visceral sensations\nwhich are universally present are active, but this case takes us beyond\nthe range of Scherner\u2019s theory.\nThe value of Scherner\u2019s and Volkelt\u2019s discussions lies in the fact that\nthey call attention to a number of characteristics of the dream content\nwhich are in need of explanation, and which seem to promise new\nknowledge. It is quite true that symbolisations of organs of the body\nand of their functions are contained in dreams, that water in a dream\noften signifies a desire to urinate, that the male genital may often be\nrepresented by a staff standing erect or by a pillar, &c. In dreams\nwhich show a very animated field of vision and brilliant colours, in\ncontrast to the dimness of other dreams, the interpretation may hardly\nbe dismissed that they are \u201cdreams of visual stimulation,\u201d any more than\nit may be disputed that there is a contribution of illusory formations\nin dreams which contain noise and confusion of voices. A dream like that\nof Scherner, of two rows of fair handsome boys standing opposite to each\nother on a bridge, attacking each other and then taking their places\nagain, until finally the dreamer himself sits down on the bridge and\npulls a long tooth out of his jaw; or a similar one of Volkelt\u2019s, in\nwhich two rows of drawers play a part, and which again ends in the\nextraction of a tooth; dream formations of this sort, which are related\nin great numbers by the authors, prevent our discarding Scherner\u2019s\ntheory as an idle fabrication without seeking to find its kernel of\ntruth. We are now confronted by the task of giving the supposed\nsymbolisation of the dental stimulus an explanation of a different kind.\nThroughout our consideration of the theory of the somatic sources of\ndreams, I have refrained from urging the argument which is inferred from\nour dream analyses. If we have succeeded in proving, by a procedure\nwhich other authors have not applied in their investigation of dreams,\nthat the dream as a psychic action possesses value peculiar to itself,\nthat a wish supplies the motive for its formation, and that the\nexperiences of the previous day furnish the immediate material for its\ncontent, any other theory of dreams neglecting such an important method\nof investigation, and accordingly causing the dream to appear a useless\nand problematic psychic reaction to somatic stimuli, is dismissible\nwithout any particular comment. Otherwise there must be\u2014which is highly\nimprobable\u2014two entirely different kinds of dreams, of which only one has\ncome under our observation, while only the other has been observed by\nthe earlier connoisseurs of the dream. It still remains to provide a\nplace for the facts which are used to support the prevailing theory of\nsomatic dream-stimuli, within our own theory of dreams.\nWe have already taken the first step in this direction in setting up the\nthesis that the dream activity is under a compulsion to elaborate all\nthe dream stimuli which are simultaneously present into a unified whole\n(p. 151). We have seen that when two or more experiences capable of\nmaking an impression have been left over from the previous day, the\nwishes which result from them are united into one dream; similarly, that\nan impression possessing psychic value and the indifferent experiences\nof the previous day are united in the dream material, provided there are\navailable connecting ideas between the two. Thus the dream appears to be\na reaction to everything which is simultaneously present as actual in\nthe sleeping mind. As far as we have hitherto analysed the dream\nmaterial, we have discovered it to be a collection of psychic remnants\nand memory traces, which we were obliged to credit (on account of the\npreference shown for recent and infantile material) with a character of\nactuality, though the nature of this was not at the time determinable.\nNow it will not be difficult to foretell what will happen when new\nmaterial in the form of sensations is added to these actualities of\nmemory. These stimuli likewise derive importance for the dream because\nthey are actual; they are united with the other psychic actualities in\norder to make up the material for dream formation. To express it\ndifferently, the stimuli which appear during sleep are worked over into\nthe fulfilment of a wish, the other component parts of which are the\nremnants of daily experience with which we are familiar. This union,\nhowever, is not inevitable; we have heard that more than one sort of\nattitude towards bodily stimuli is possible during sleep. Wherever this\nunion has been brought about, it has simply been possible to find for\nthe dream content that kind of presentation material which will give\nrepresentation to both classes of dream sources, the somatic as well as\nthe psychic.\nThe essential nature of the dream is not changed by this addition of\nsomatic material to the psychic sources of the dream; it remains the\nfulfilment of a wish without reference to the way in which its\nexpression is determined by the actual material.\nI shall gladly find room here for a number of peculiarities, which serve\nto put a different face on the significance of external stimuli for the\ndream. I imagine that a co-operation of individual, physiological, and\naccidental factors, conditioned by momentary circumstances, determines\nhow one will act in each particular case of intensive objective\nstimulation during sleep; the degree of the profoundness of sleep\nwhether habitual or accidental in connection with the intensity of the\nstimulus, will in one case make it possible to suppress the stimulus, so\nthat it will not disturb sleep; in another case they will force an\nawakening or will support the attempt to overcome the stimulus by\nweaving it into the texture of the dream. In correspondence with the\nmultiplicity of these combinations, external objective stimuli will\nreceive expression more frequently in the case of one person than in\nthat of another. In the case of myself, who am an excellent sleeper, and\nwho stubbornly resists any kind of disturbance in sleep, this\nintermixture of external causes of irritation into my dreams is very\nrare, while psychic motives apparently cause me to dream very easily. I\nhave indeed noted only a single dream in which an objective, painful\nsource of stimulation is demonstrable, and it will be highly instructive\nto see what effect the external stimulus had in this very dream.\n_I am riding on a grey horse, at first timidly and awkwardly, as though\nI were only leaning against something. I meet a colleague P., who is\nmounted on a horse and is wearing a heavy woollen suit; he calls my\nattention to something (probably to the fact that my riding position is\nbad). Now I become more and more expert on the horse, which is most\nintelligent; I sit comfortably, and I notice that I am already quite at\nhome in the saddle. For a saddle I have a kind of padding, which\ncompletely fills the space between the neck and the rump of the horse.\nIn this manner I ride with difficulty between two lumber-wagons. After\nhaving ridden up the street for some distance, I turn around and want to\ndismount, at first in front of a little open chapel, which is situated\nclose to the street. Then I actually dismount in front of a chapel which\nstands near the first; the hotel is in the same street, I could let the\nhorse go there by itself, but I prefer to lead it there. It seems as if\nI should be ashamed to arrive there on horseback. In front of the hotel\nis standing a hall-boy who shows me a card of mine which has been found,\nand who ridicules me on account of it. On the card is written, doubly\nunderlined, \u201cEat nothing,\u201d and then a second sentence (indistinct)\nsomething like \u201cDo not work\u201d; at the same time a hazy idea that I am in\na strange city, in which I do no work._\nIt will not be apparent at once that this dream originated under the\ninfluence, or rather under the compulsion, of a stimulus of pain. The\nday before I had suffered from furuncles, which made every movement a\ntorture, and at last a furuncle had grown to the size of an apple at the\nroot of the scrotum, and had caused me the most intolerable pains that\naccompanied every step; a feverish lassitude, lack of appetite, and the\nhard work to which I had nevertheless kept myself during the day, had\nconspired with the pain to make me lose my temper. I was not altogether\nin a condition to discharge my duties as a physician, but in view of the\nnature and the location of the malady, one might have expected some\nperformance other than riding, for which I was very especially unfitted.\nIt is this very activity, of riding into which I am plunged by the\ndream; it is the most energetic denial of the suffering which is capable\nof being conceived. In the first place, I do not know how to ride, I do\nnot usually dream of it, and I never sat on a horse but once\u2014without a\nsaddle\u2014and then I did not feel comfortable. But in this dream I ride as\nthough I had no furuncle on the perineum, and why? _just because I don\u2019t\nwant any_. According to the description my saddle is the poultice which\nhas made it possible for me to go to sleep. Probably I did not feel\nanything of my pain\u2014as I was thus taken care of\u2014during the first few\nhours of sleeping. Then the painful sensations announced themselves and\ntried to wake me up, whereupon the dream came and said soothingly: \u201cKeep\non sleeping, you won\u2019t wake up anyway! You have no furuncle at all, for\nyou are riding on a horse, and with a furuncle where you have it riding\nis impossible!\u201d And the dream was successful; the pain was stifled, and\nI went on sleeping.\nBut the dream was not satisfied with \u201csuggesting away\u201d the furuncle by\nmeans of tenaciously adhering to an idea incompatible with that of the\nmalady, in doing which it behaved like the hallucinatory insanity of the\nmother who has lost her child, or like the merchant who has been\ndeprived of his fortune by losses.[BP] In addition the details of the\ndenied sensation and of the image which is used to displace it are\nemployed by the dream as a means to connect the material ordinarily\nactually present in the mind with the dream situation, and to give this\nmaterial representation. I am riding on a _grey_ horse\u2014the colour of the\nhorse corresponds exactly to the _pepper-and-salt_ costume in which I\nlast met my colleague P. in the country. I have been warned that highly\nseasoned food is the cause of furunculosis, but in any case it is\npreferable as an etiological explanation to sugar which ordinarily\nsuggests furunculosis. My friend P. has been pleased to \u201cride the high\nhorse\u201d with regard to me, ever since he superseded me in the treatment\nof a female patient, with whom I had performed great feats (in the dream\nI first sit on the horse side-saddle fashion, like a circus rider), but\nwho really led me wherever she wished, like the horse in the anecdote\nabout the Sunday equestrian. Thus the horse came to be a symbolic\nrepresentation of a lady patient (in the dream it is most intelligent).\n\u201cI feel quite at home up here,\u201d refers to the position which I occupied\nin the patient\u2019s household until I was replaced by my colleague P. \u201cI\nthought you were securely seated in the saddle,\u201d one of my few\nwell-wishers among the great physicians of this city recently said to me\nwith reference to the same household. And it was a feat to practise\npsychotherapy for ten hours a day with such pains, but I know that I\ncannot continue my particularly difficult work for any length of time\nwithout complete physical health, and the dream is full of gloomy\nallusions to the situation which must in that case result (the card such\nas neurasthenics have and present to doctors): _No work and no food_.\nWith further interpretation I see that the dream activity has succeeded\nin finding the way from the wish-situation of riding to very early\ninfantile scenes of quarrelling, which must have taken place between me\nand my nephew, who is now living in England, and who, moreover, is a\nyear older than I. Besides it has taken up elements from my journeys to\nItaly; the street in the dream is composed of impressions of Verona and\nSiena. Still more exhaustive interpretation leads to sexual\ndream-thoughts, and I recall what significance dream allusions to that\nbeautiful country had in the case of a female patient who had never been\nin Italy (Itlay\u2014German _gen Italien_\u2014_Genitalien_\u2014genitals). At the same\ntime there are references to the house in which I was physician before\nmy friend P., and to the place where the furuncle is located.\nAmong the dreams mentioned in the previous chapter there are several\nwhich might serve as examples for the elaboration of so-called nerve\nstimuli. The dream about drinking in full draughts is one of this sort;\nthe somatic excitement in it seems to be the only source of the dream,\nand the wish resulting from the sensation\u2014thirst\u2014the only motive for\ndreaming. Something similar is true of the other simple dreams, if the\nsomatic excitement alone is capable of forming a wish. The dream of the\nsick woman who throws the cooling apparatus from her cheek at night is\nan instance of a peculiar way of reacting to painful excitements with a\nwish-fulfilment; it seems as though the patient had temporarily\nsucceeded in making herself analgesic by ascribing her pains to a\nstranger.\nMy dream about the three Parc\u00e6 is obviously a dream of hunger, but it\nhas found means to refer the need for food back to the longing of the\nchild for its mother\u2019s breast, and to make the harmless desire a cloak\nfor a more serious one, which is not permitted to express itself so\nopenly. In the dream about Count Thun we have seen how an accidental\nbodily desire is brought into connection with the strongest, and\nlikewise the most strongly suppressed emotions of the psychic life. And\nwhen the First Consul incorporates the sound of an exploding bomb into a\ndream of battle before it causes him to wake, as in the case reported by\nGarnier, the purpose for which psychic activity generally concerns\nitself with sensations occurring during sleep is revealed with\nextraordinary clearness. A young lawyer, who has been deeply preoccupied\nwith his first great bankruptcy proceeding, and who goes to sleep during\nthe afternoon following, acts just like the great Napoleon. He dreams\nabout a certain G. Reich in _Hussiatyn_ (German _husten_\u2014to cough), whom\nhe knows in connection with the bankruptcy proceeding, but _Hussiatyn_\nforces itself upon his attention still further, with the result that he\nis obliged to awaken, and hears his wife\u2014who is suffering from bronchial\ncatarrh\u2014coughing violently.\nLet us compare the dream of Napoleon I., who, incidentally, was an\nexcellent sleeper, with that of the sleepy student, who was awakened by\nhis landlady with the admonition that he must go to the hospital, who\nthereupon dreams himself into a bed in the hospital, and then sleeps on,\nwith the following account of his motives: If I am already in the\nhospital, I shan\u2019t have to get up in order to go there. The latter is\nobviously a dream of convenience; the sleeper frankly admits to himself\nthe motive for his dreaming; but he thereby reveals one of the secrets\nof dreaming in general. In a certain sense all dreams are dreams of\nconvenience; they serve the purpose of continuing sleep instead of\nawakening. _The dream is the guardian of sleep, not the disturber of\nit._ We shall justify this conception with respect to the psychic\nfactors of awakening elsewhere; it is possible, however, at this point\nto prove its applicability to the influence exerted by objective\nexternal excitements. Either the mind does not concern itself at all\nwith the causes of sensations, if it is able to do this in spite of\ntheir intensity and of their significance, which is well understood by\nit; or it employs the dream to deny these stimuli; or thirdly, if it is\nforced to recognise the stimulus, it seeks to find that interpretation\nof the stimulus which shall represent the actual sensation as a\ncomponent part of a situation which is desired and which is compatible\nwith sleep. The actual sensation is woven into the dream _in order to\ndeprive it of its reality_. Napoleon is permitted to go on sleeping; it\nis only a dream recollection of the thunder of the cannon at Arcole\nwhich is trying to disturb him.[BQ]\n_The wish to sleep, by which the conscious ego has been suspended and\nwhich along with the dream-censor contributes its share to the dream,\nmust thus always be taken into account as a motive for the formation of\ndreams, and every successful dream is a fulfilment of this wish._ The\nrelation of this general, regularly present, and invariable sleep-wish\nto the other wishes, of which now the one, now the other is fulfilled,\nwill be the subject of a further explanation. In the wish to sleep we\nhave discovered a factor capable of supplying the deficiency in the\ntheory of Str\u00fcmpell and Wundt, and of explaining the perversity and\ncapriciousness in the interpretation of the outer stimulus. The correct\ninterpretation, of which the sleeping mind is quite capable, would imply\nan active interest and would require that sleep be terminated; hence, of\nthose interpretations which are possible at all, only those are admitted\nwhich are agreeable to the absolute censorship of the somatic wish. It\nis something like this: It\u2019s the nightingale and not the lark. For if\nit\u2019s the lark, love\u2019s night is at an end. From among the interpretations\nof the excitement which are at the moment possible, that one is selected\nwhich can secure the best connection with the wish-possibilities that\nare lying in wait in the mind. Thus everything is definitely determined,\nand nothing is left to caprice. The misinterpretation is not an\nillusion, but\u2014if you will\u2014an excuse. Here again, however, there is\nadmitted an action which is a modification of the normal psychic\nprocedure, as in the case where substitution by means of displacement is\neffected for the purposes of the dream-censor.\nIf the outer nerve stimuli and inner bodily stimuli are sufficiently\nintense to compel psychic attention, they represent\u2014that is, in case\nthey result in dreaming and not in awakening\u2014a definite point in the\nformation of dreams, a nucleus in the dream material, for which an\nappropriate wish-fulfilment is sought, in a way similar (see above) to\nthe search for connecting ideas between two dream stimuli. To this\nextent it is true for a number of dreams that the somatic determines\nwhat their content is to be. In this extreme case a wish which is not\nexactly actual is aroused for the purpose of dream formation. But the\ndream can do nothing but represent a wish in a situation as fulfilled;\nit is, as it were, confronted by the task of seeking what wish may be\nrepresented and fulfilled by means of the situation which is now actual.\nEven if this actual material is of a painful or disagreeable character,\nstill it is not useless for the purposes of dream formation. The psychic\nlife has control even over wishes the fulfilment of which brings forth\npleasure\u2014a statement which seems contradictory, but which becomes\nintelligible if one takes into account the presence of two psychic\ninstances and the censor existing between them.\nThere are in the psychic life, as we have heard, _repressed_ wishes\nwhich belong to the first system, and to whose fulfilment the second\nsystem is opposed. There are wishes of this kind\u2014and we do not mean this\nin an historic sense, that there have been such wishes and that these\nhave then been destroyed\u2014but the theory of repression, which is\nessential to the study of psychoneurosis, asserts that such repressed\nwishes still exist, contemporaneously with an inhibition weighing them\ndown. Language has hit upon the truth when it speaks of the\n\u201csuppression\u201d of such impulses. The psychic contrivance for bringing\nsuch wishes to realisation remains preserved and in a condition to be\nused. But if it happens that such a suppressed wish is fulfilled, the\nvanquished inhibition of the second system (which is capable of becoming\nconscious) is then expressed as a painful feeling. To close this\ndiscussion; if sensations of a disagreeable character which originate\nfrom somatic sources are presented during sleep, this constellation is\ntaken advantage of by the dream activity to represent the\nfulfilment\u2014with more or less retention of the censor\u2014of an otherwise\nsuppressed wish.\nThis condition of affairs makes possible a number of anxiety dreams,\nwhile another series of the dream formations which are unfavourable to\nthe wish theory exhibits a different mechanism. For anxiety in dreams\nmay be of a psychoneurotic nature, or it may originate in psychosexual\nexcitements, in which case the anxiety corresponds to a repressed\n_libido_. Then this anxiety as well as the whole anxiety dream has the\nsignificance of a neurotic symptom, and we are at the dividing-line\nwhere the wish-fulfilling tendency of dreams disappears. But in other\nanxiety-dreams the feeling of anxiety comes from somatic sources (for\ninstance in the case of persons suffering from pulmonary or heart\ntrouble, where there is occasional difficulty in getting breath), and\nthen it is used to aid those energetically suppressed wishes in\nattaining fulfilment in the form of a dream, the dreaming of which from\npsychic motives would have resulted in the same release of fear. It is\nnot difficult to unite these two apparently discrepant cases. Of two\npsychic formations, an emotional inclination and an ideal content, which\nare intimately connected, the one, which is presented as actual,\nsupports the other in the dream; now anxiety of somatic origin supports\nthe suppressed presentation content, now the ideal content, which is\nfreed from suppression, and which proceeds with the impetus given by\nsexual emotion, assists the discharge of anxiety. Of the one case it may\nbe said that an emotion of somatic origin is psychically interpreted; in\nthe other case everything is of psychic origin but the content which has\nbeen suppressed is easily replaced by a somatic interpretation which is\nsuited to anxiety. The difficulties which lie in the way of\nunderstanding all this have little to do with the dream; they are due to\nthe fact that in discussing these points we are touching upon the\nproblems of the development of anxiety and of repression.\nUndoubtedly the aggregate of bodily feelings is to be included among the\ncommanding dream stimuli which originate internally. Not that it is able\nto furnish the dream content, but it forces the dream thoughts to make a\nchoice from the material destined to serve the purpose of representation\nin the dream content; it does this by putting within easy reach that\npart of the material which is suited to its own character, while\nwithholding the other. Moreover this general feeling, which is left over\nfrom the day, is probably connected with the psychic remnants which are\nsignificant for the dream.\nIf somatic sources of excitement occurring during sleep\u2014that is, the\nsensations of sleep\u2014are not of unusual intensity, they play a part in\nthe formation of dreams similar, in my judgment, to that of the\nimpressions of the day which have remained recent but indifferent. I\nmean that they are drawn into the dream formation, if they are qualified\nfor being united with the presentation content of the psychic\ndream-source, but in no other case. They are treated as a cheap\never-ready material, which is utilised as often as it is needed, instead\nof prescribing, as a precious material does, the manner in which it is\nto be utilised. The case is similar to that where a patron of art brings\nto an artist a rare stone, a fragment of onyx, in order that a work of\nart may be made of it. The size of the stone, its colour, and its\nmarking help to decide what bust or what scene shall be represented in\nit, while in the case where there is a uniform and abundant supply of\nmarble or sandstone the artist follows only the idea which takes shape\nin his mind. Only in this manner, it seems to me, is the fact explicable\nthat the dream content resulting from bodily excitements that have not\nbeen accentuated to a usual degree, does not appear in all dreams and\nduring every night.\nPerhaps an example, which takes us back to the interpretation of dreams,\nwill best illustrate my meaning. One day I was trying to understand the\nmeaning of the sensations of being impeded, of not being able to move\nfrom the spot, of not being able to get finished, &c., which are dreamt\nabout so often, and which are so closely allied to anxiety. That night I\nhad the following dream: _I am very incompletely dressed, and I go from\na dwelling on the ground floor up a flight of stairs to an upper story.\nIn doing this I jump over three steps at a time, and I am glad to find I\ncan mount the steps so quickly. Suddenly I see that a servant girl is\ncoming down the stairs, that is, towards me. I am ashamed and try to\nhurry away, and now there appears that sensation of being impeded; I am\nglued to the steps and cannot move from the spot._\nAnalysis: The situation of the dream is taken from everyday reality. In\na house in Vienna I have two apartments, which are connected only by a\nflight of stairs outside. My consultation-rooms and my study are on an\nelevated portion of the ground floor, and one story higher are my\nliving-rooms. When I have finished my work downstairs late at night, I\ngo up the steps into my bedroom. On the evening before the dream I had\nactually gone this short distance in a somewhat disorderly attire\u2014that\nis to say, I had taken off my collar, cravat, and cuffs; but in the\ndream this has changed into a somewhat more advanced degree of undress,\nwhich as usual is indefinite. Jumping over the steps is my usual method\nof mounting stairs; moreover it is the fulfilment of a wish that has\nbeen recognised in the dream, for I have reassured myself about the\ncondition of my heart action by the ease of this accomplishment.\nMoreover the manner in which I climb the stairs is an effective contrast\nto the sensation of being impeded which occurs in the second half of the\ndream. It shows me\u2014something which needed no proof\u2014that the dream has no\ndifficulty in representing motor actions as carried out fully and\ncompletely; think of flying in dreams!\nBut the stairs which I go up are not those of my house; at first I do\nnot recognise them; only the person coming toward me reveals to me the\nlocation which they are intended to signify. This woman is the maid of\nthe old lady whom I visit twice daily to give hypodermic injections; the\nstairs, too, are quite similar to those which I must mount there twice\ndaily.\nHow do this flight of stairs and this woman get into my dream? Being\nashamed because one is not fully dressed, is undoubtedly of a sexual\ncharacter; the servant of whom I dream is older than I, sulky, and not\nin the least attractive. These questions call up exactly the following\noccurrences: When I make my morning visit at this house I am usually\nseized with a desire to clear my throat; the product of the\nexpectoration falls upon the steps. For there is no spittoon on either\nof these floors, and I take the view that the stairs should not be kept\nclean at my expense, but by the provision of a spittoon. The\nhousekeeper, likewise an elderly and sulky person, with instincts for\ncleanliness, takes another view of the matter. She lies in wait for me\nto see whether I take the liberty referred to, and when she has made\nsure of it, I hear her growl distinctly. For days thereafter she refuses\nto show me her customary regard when we meet. On the day before the\ndream the position of the housekeeper had been strengthened by the\nservant girl. I had just finished my usual hurried visit to the patient\nwhen the servant confronted me in the ante-room and observed: \u201cYou might\nas well have wiped your shoes to-day, doctor, before you came into the\nroom. The red carpet is all dirty again from your feet.\u201d This is the\nwhole claim which the flight of stairs and the servant-girl can make for\nappearing in my dream.\nAn intimate connection exists between my flying over the stairs and my\nspitting on the stairs. Pharyngitis and diseases of the heart are both\nsaid to be punishments for the vice of smoking, on account of which\nvice, of course, I do not enjoy a reputation for great neatness with my\nhousekeeper in the one house any more than in the other, both of which\nthe dream fuses into a single image.\nI must postpone the further interpretation of this dream until I can\ngive an account of the origin of the typical dream of incomplete dress.\nI only note as a preliminary result from the dream which has just been\ncited that the dream sensation of inhibited action is always aroused at\na point where a certain connection requires it. A peculiar condition of\nmy motility during sleep cannot be the cause of this dream content, for\na moment before I saw myself hurrying over the steps with ease, as\nthough in confirmation of this fact.\n(_d_) _Typical Dreams_\nIn general we are not in a position to interpret the dream of another\nperson if he is unwilling to furnish us with the unconscious thoughts\nwhich lie behind the dream content, and for this reason the practical\napplicability of our method of dream interpretation is seriously\ncurtailed.[BR] But there are a certain number of dreams\u2014in contrast with\nthe usual freedom displayed by the individual in fashioning his dream\nworld with characteristic peculiarity, and thereby making it\nunintelligible\u2014which almost every one has dreamed in the same manner,\nand of which we are accustomed to assume that they have the same\nsignificance in the case of every dreamer. A peculiar interest belongs\nto these typical dreams for the reason that they probably all come from\nthe same sources with every person, that they are thus particularly\nsuited to give us information upon the sources of dreams.\nTypical dreams are worthy of the most exhaustive investigation. I shall,\nhowever, only give a somewhat detailed consideration to examples of this\nspecies, and for this purpose I shall first select the so-called\nembarrassment dream of nakedness, and the dream of the death of dear\nrelatives.\nThe dream of being naked or scantily clad in the presence of strangers\noccurs with the further addition that one is not at all ashamed of it,\n&c. But the dream of nakedness is worthy of our interest only when shame\nand embarrassment are felt in it, when one wishes to flee or to hide,\nand when one feels the strange inhibition that it is impossible to move\nfrom the spot and that one is incapable of altering the disagreeable\nsituation. It is only in this connection that the dream is typical; the\nnucleus of its content may otherwise be brought into all kinds of\nrelations or may be replaced by individual amplifications. It is\nessentially a question of a disagreeable sensation of the nature of\nshame, the wish to be able to hide one\u2019s nakedness, chiefly by means of\nlocomotion, without being able to accomplish this. I believe that the\ngreat majority of my readers will at some time have found themselves in\nthis situation in a dream.\nUsually the nature and manner of the experience is indistinct. It is\nusually reported, \u201cI was in my shirt,\u201d but this is rarely a clear image;\nin most cases the lack of clothing is so indeterminate that it is\ndesignated in the report of the dream by a set of alternatives: \u201cI was\nin my chemise or in my petticoat.\u201d As a rule the deficiency in the\ntoilet is not serious enough to justify the feeling of shame attached to\nit. For a person who has served in the army, nakedness is often replaced\nby a mode of adjustment that is contrary to regulations. \u201cI am on the\nstreet without my sabre and I see officers coming,\u201d or \u201cI am without my\nnecktie,\u201d or \u201cI am wearing checkered civilian\u2019s trousers,\u201d &c.\nThe persons before whom one is ashamed are almost always strangers with\nfaces that have been left undetermined. It never occurs in the typical\ndream that one is reproved or even noticed on account of the dress which\ncauses the embarrassment to one\u2019s self. Quite on the contrary, the\npeople have an air of indifference, or, as I had opportunity to observe\nin a particularly clear dream, they look stiffly solemn. This is worth\nthinking about.\nThe shamed embarrassment of the dreamer and the indifference of the\nspectators form a contradiction which often occurs in the dream. It\nwould better accord with the feelings of the dreamer if the strangers\nlooked at him in astonishment and laughed at him, or if they grew\nindignant. I think, however, that the latter unpleasant feature has been\nobviated by the tendency to wish-fulfilment, while the embarrassment,\nbeing retained on some account or other, has been left standing, and\nthus the two parts fail to agree. We have interesting evidence to show\nthat the dream, whose appearance has been partially disfigured by the\ntendency to wish-fulfilment, has not been properly understood. For it\nhas become the basis of a fairy tale familiar to us all in Andersen\u2019s\nversion,[BS] and it has recently received poetic treatment by L. Fulda\nin the _Talisman_. In Andersen\u2019s fairy tale we are told of two impostors\nwho weave a costly garment for the Emperor, which, however, shall be\nvisible only to the good and true. The Emperor goes forth clad in this\ninvisible garment, and, the fabric serving as a sort of touchstone, all\nthe people are frightened into acting as though they did not notice the\nnakedness of the Emperor.\nBut such is the situation in our dream. It does not require great\nboldness to assume that the unintelligible dream content has suggested\nthe invention of a state of undress in which the situation that is being\nremembered becomes significant. This situation has then been deprived of\nits original meaning, and placed at the service of other purposes. But\nwe shall see that such misunderstanding of the dream content often\noccurs on account of the conscious activity of the second psychic\nsystem, and is to be recognised as a factor in the ultimate formation of\nthe dream; furthermore, that in the development of the obsessions and\nphobias similar misunderstandings, likewise within the same psychic\npersonality, play a leading part. The source from which in our dream the\nmaterial for this transformation is taken can also be explained. The\nimpostor is the dream, the Emperor is the dreamer himself, and the\nmoralising tendency betrays a hazy knowledge of the fact that the latent\ndream content is occupied with forbidden wishes which have become the\nvictims of repression. The connection in which such dreams appear during\nmy analysis of neurotics leaves no room for doubting that the dream is\nbased upon a recollection from earliest childhood. Only in our childhood\nwas there a time when we were seen by our relatives as well as by\nstrange nurses, servant girls, and visitors, in scanty clothing, and at\nthat time we were not ashamed of our nakedness.[BT]\nIt may be observed in the case of children who are a little older that\nbeing undressed has a kind of intoxicating effect upon them, instead of\nmaking them ashamed. They laugh, jump about, and strike their bodies;\nthe mother, or whoever is present, forbids them to do this, and says:\n\u201cFie, that is shameful\u2014you mustn\u2019t do that.\u201d Children often show\nexhibitional cravings; it is hardly possible to go through a village in\nour part of the country without meeting a two or three-year-old tot who\nlifts up his or her shirt before the traveller, perhaps in his honour.\nOne of my patients has reserved in his conscious memory a scene from the\neighth year of his life in which he had just undressed previous to going\nto bed, and was about to dance into the room of his little sister in his\nundershirt when the servant prevented his doing it. In the childhood\nhistory of neurotics, denudation in the presence of children of the\nopposite sex plays a great part; in paranoia the desire to be observed\nwhile dressing and undressing may be directly traced to these\nexperiences; among those remaining perverted there is a class which has\naccentuated the childish impulse to a compulsion\u2014they are the\nexhibitionists.\nThis age of childhood in which the sense of shame is lacking seems to\nour later recollections a Paradise, and Paradise itself is nothing but a\ncomposite phantasy from the childhood of the individual. It is for this\nreason, too, that in Paradise human beings are naked and are not ashamed\nuntil the moment arrives when the sense of shame and of fear are\naroused; expulsion follows, and sexual life and cultural development\nbegin. Into this Paradise the dream can take us back every night; we\nhave already ventured the conjecture that the impressions from earliest\nchildhood (from the prehistoric period until about the end of the fourth\nyear) in themselves, and independently of everything else, crave\nreproduction, perhaps without further reference to their content, and\nthat the repetition of them is the fulfilment of a wish. Dreams of\nnakedness, then, are exhibition dreams.[BU]\nOne\u2019s own person, which is seen not as that of a child, but as belonging\nto the present, and the idea of scanty clothing, which became buried\nbeneath so many later _n\u00e9glig\u00e9e_ recollections or because of the censor,\nturns out to be obscure\u2014these two things constitute the nucleus of the\nexhibition dream. Next come the persons before whom one is ashamed. I\nknow of no example where the actual spectators at those infantile\nexhibitions reappear in the dream. For the dream is hardly ever a simple\nrecollection. Strangely enough, those persons who are the objects of our\nsexual interest during childhood are omitted from all the reproductions\nof the dream, of hysteria, and of the compulsion neurosis; paranoia\nalone puts the spectators back into their places, and is fanatically\nconvinced of their presence, although they remain invisible. What the\ndream substitutes for these, the \u201cmany strange people,\u201d who take no\nnotice of the spectacle which is presented, is exactly the wish-opposite\nof that single, intimate person for whom the exposure was intended.\n\u201cMany strange people,\u201d moreover, are often found in the dream in any\nother favourable connection; as a wish-opposite they always signify \u201ca\nsecret.\u201d[BV] It may be seen how the restoration of the old condition of\naffairs, as it occurs in paranoia, is subject to this antithesis. One is\nno longer alone. One is certainly being watched, but the spectators are\n\u201cmany strange, curiously indeterminate people.\u201d\nFurthermore, repression has a place in the exhibition dream. For the\ndisagreeable sensation of the dream is the reaction of the second\npsychic instance to the fact that the exhibition scene which has been\nrejected by it has in spite of this succeeded in securing\nrepresentation. The only way to avoid this sensation would be not to\nrevive the scene.\nLater on we shall again deal with the sensation of being inhibited. It\nserves the dream excellently in representing the conflict of the will,\nthe negation. According to our unconscious purpose exhibition is to be\ncontinued; according to the demands of the censor, it is to be stopped.\nThe relation of our typical dreams to fairy tales and to other poetic\nmaterial is neither a sporadic nor an accidental one. Occasionally the\nkeen insight of a poet has analytically recognised the transforming\nprocess\u2014of which the poet is usually the tool\u2014and has followed it\nbackwards, that is to say, traced it to the dream. A friend has called\nmy attention to the following passage in G. Keller\u2019s _Der Gr\u00fcne\nHeinrich_: \u201cI do not wish, dear Lee, that you should ever come to\nrealise from experience the peculiar piquant truth contained in the\nsituation of Odysseus, when he appears before Nausikaa and her\nplaymates, naked and covered with mud! Would you like to know what it\nmeans? Let us consider the incident closely. If you are ever separated\nfrom your home, and from everything that is dear to you, and wander\nabout in a strange country, when you have seen and experienced much,\nwhen you have cares and sorrows, and are, perhaps, even miserable and\nforlorn, you will some night inevitably dream that you are approaching\nyour home; you will see it shining and beaming in the most beautiful\ncolours; charming, delicate and lovely figures will come to meet you;\nand you will suddenly discover that you are going about in rags, naked\nand covered with dust. A nameless feeling of shame and fear seizes you,\nyou try to cover yourself and to hide, and you awaken bathed in sweat.\nAs long as men exist, this will be the dream of the care-laden,\nfortune-battered man, and thus Homer has taken his situation from the\nprofoundest depths of the eternal character of humanity.\u201d\nThis profound and eternal character of humanity, upon the touching of\nwhich in his listeners the poet usually calculates, is made up of the\nstirrings of the spirit which are rooted in childhood, in the period\nwhich later becomes prehistoric. Suppressed and forbidden wishes of\nchildhood break forth under cover of those wishes of the homeless man\nwhich are unobjectionable and capable of becoming conscious, and for\nthat reason the dream which is made objective in the legend of Nausikaa\nregularly assumes the form of a dream of anxiety.\nMy own dream, mentioned on p. 201, of hurrying up the stairs, which is\nsoon afterward changed into that of being glued to the steps, is\nlikewise an exhibition dream, because it shows the essential components\nof such a dream. It must thus permit of being referred to childish\nexperiences, and the possession of these ought to tell us how far the\nbehaviour of the servant girl towards me\u2014her reproach that I had soiled\nthe carpet\u2014helped her to secure the position which she occupies in the\ndream. I am now able to furnish the desired explanation. One learns in\npsychoanalysis to interpret temporal proximity by objective connection;\ntwo thoughts, apparently without connection, which immediately follow\none another, belong to a unity which can be inferred; just as an _a_ and\na _t_, which I write down together, should be pronounced as one\nsyllable, _at_. The same is true of the relation of dreams to one\nanother. The dream just cited, of the stairs, has been taken from a\nseries of dreams, whose other members I am familiar with on account of\nhaving interpreted them. The dream which is included in this series must\nbelong to the same connection. Now the other dreams of the series are\nbased upon the recollection of a nurse to whom I was entrusted from some\ntime in the period when I was suckling to the age of two and a half\nyears, and of whom a hazy recollection has remained in my consciousness.\nAccording to information which I have recently obtained from my mother,\nshe was old and ugly, but very intelligent and thorough; according to\ninferences which I may draw from my dreams, she did not always give me\nthe kindest treatment, and said hard words to me when I showed\ninsufficient aptitude for education in cleanliness. Thus by attempting\nto continue this educational work the servant girl develops a claim to\nbe treated by me, in the dream, as an incarnation of the prehistoric old\nwoman. It is to be assumed that the child bestowed his love upon this\ngoverness in spite of her bad treatment of him.[BW]\nAnother series of dreams which might be called typical are those which\nhave the content that a dear relative, parent, brother, or sister, child\nor the like, has died. Two classes of these dreams must immediately be\ndistinguished\u2014those in which the dreamer remains unaffected by sorrow\nwhile dreaming, and those in which he feels profound grief on account of\nthe death, in which he even expresses this grief during sleep by fervid\ntears.\nWe may ignore the dreams of the first group; they have no claim to be\nreckoned as typical. If they are analysed, it is found that they signify\nsomething else than what they contain, that they are intended to cover\nup some other wish. Thus it is with the dream of the aunt who sees the\nonly son of her sister lying on a bier before her (p 129). This does not\nsignify that she wishes the death of her little nephew; it only\nconceals, as we have learned, a wish to see a beloved person once more\nafter long separation\u2014the same person whom she had seen again after a\nsimilar long intermission at the funeral of another nephew. This wish,\nwhich is the real content of the dream, gives no cause for sorrow, and\nfor that reason no sorrow is felt in the dream. It may be seen in this\ncase that the emotion which is contained in the dream does not belong to\nthe manifest content of the dream, but to the latent one, and that the\nemotional content has remained free from the disfigurement which has\nbefallen the presentation content.\nIt is a different story with the dreams in which the death of a beloved\nrelative is imagined and where sorrowful emotion is felt. These signify,\nas their content says, the wish that the person in question may die, and\nas I may here expect that the feelings of all readers and of all persons\nwho have dreamt anything similar will object to my interpretation, I\nmust strive to present my proof on the broadest possible basis.\nWe have already had one example to show that the wishes represented in\nthe dream as fulfilled are not always actual wishes. They may also be\ndead, discarded, covered, and repressed wishes, which we must\nnevertheless credit with a sort of continuous existence on account of\ntheir reappearance in the dream. They are not dead like persons who have\ndied in our sense, but they resemble the shades in the _Odyssey_ which\nawaken a certain kind of life as soon as they have drunk blood. In the\ndream of the dead child in the box (p. 130) we were concerned with a\nwish that had been actual fifteen years before, and which had been\nfrankly admitted from that time. It is, perhaps, not unimportant from\nthe point of view of dream theory if I add that a recollection from\nearliest childhood is at the basis even of this dream. While the dreamer\nwas a little child\u2014it cannot be definitely determined at what time\u2014she\nhad heard that during pregnancy of which she was the fruit her mother\nhad fallen into a profound depression of spirits and had passionately\nwished for the death of her child before birth. Having grown up herself\nand become pregnant, she now follows the example of her mother.\nIf some one dreams with expressions of grief that his father or mother,\nhis brother or sister, has died, I shall not use the dream as a proof\nthat he wishes them dead _now_. The theory of the dreams does not\nrequire so much; it is satisfied with concluding that the dreamer has\nwished them dead\u2014at some one time in childhood. I fear, however, that\nthis limitation will not contribute much to quiet the objectors; they\nmight just as energetically contest the possibility that they have ever\nhad such thoughts as they are sure that they do not cherish such wishes\nat present. I must, therefore, reconstruct a part of the submerged\ninfantile psychology on the basis of the testimony which the present\nstill furnishes.[BX]\nLet us at first consider the relation of children to their brothers and\nsisters. I do not know why we presuppose that it must be a loving one,\nsince examples of brotherly and sisterly enmity among adults force\nthemselves upon every one\u2019s experience, and since we so often know that\nthis estrangement originated even during childhood or has always\nexisted. But many grown-up people, who to-day are tenderly attached to\ntheir brothers and sisters and stand by them, have lived with them\nduring childhood in almost uninterrupted hostility. The older child has\nill-treated the younger, slandered it, and deprived it of its toys; the\nyounger has been consumed by helpless fury against the elder, has envied\nit and feared it, or its first impulse toward liberty and first feelings\nof injustice have been directed against the oppressor. The parents say\nthat the children do not agree, and cannot find the reason for it. It is\nnot difficult to see that the character even of a well-behaved child is\nnot what we wish to find in a grown-up person. The child is absolutely\negotistical; it feels its wants acutely and strives remorselessly to\nsatisfy them, especially with its competitors, other children, and in\nthe first instance with its brothers and sisters. For doing this we do\nnot call the child wicked\u2014we call it naughty; it is not responsible for\nits evil deeds either in our judgment or in the eyes of the penal law.\nAnd this is justifiably so; for we may expect that within this very\nperiod of life which we call childhood, altruistic impulses and morality\nwill come to life in the little egotist, and that, in the words of\nMeynert, a secondary ego will overlay and restrain the primary one. It\nis true that morality does not develop simultaneously in all\ndepartments, and furthermore, the duration of the unmoral period of\nchildhood is of different length in different individuals. In cases\nwhere the development of this morality fails to appear, we are pleased\nto talk about \u201cdegeneration\u201d; they are obviously cases of arrested\ndevelopment. Where the primary character has already been covered up by\nlater development, it may be at least partially uncovered again by an\nattack of hysteria. The correspondence between the so-called hysterical\ncharacter and that of a naughty child is strikingly evident. A\ncompulsion neurosis, on the other hand, corresponds to a super-morality,\nimposed upon the primary character that is again asserting itself, as an\nincreased check.\nMany persons, then, who love their brothers and sisters, and who would\nfeel bereaved by their decease, have evil wishes towards them from\nearlier times in their unconscious wishes, which are capable of being\nrealised in the dream. It is particularly interesting to observe little\nchildren up to three years old in their attitude towards their brothers\nand sisters. So far the child has been the only one; he is now informed\nthat the stork has brought a new child. The younger surveys the arrival,\nand then expresses his opinion decidedly: \u201cThe stork had better take it\nback again.\u201d[BY]\nI subscribe in all seriousness to the opinion that the child knows\nenough to calculate the disadvantage it has to expect on account of the\nnew-comer. I know in the case of a lady of my acquaintance who agrees\nvery well with a sister four years younger than herself, that she\nresponded to the news of her younger sister\u2019s arrival with the following\nwords: \u201cBut I shan\u2019t give her my red cap, anyway.\u201d If the child comes to\nthis realisation only at a later time, its enmity will be aroused at\nthat point. I know of a case where a girl, not yet three years old,\ntried to strangle a suckling in the cradle, because its continued\npresence, she suspected, boded her no good. Children are capable of envy\nat this time of life in all its intensity and distinctness. Again,\nperhaps, the little brother or sister has really soon disappeared; the\nchild has again drawn the entire affection of the household to itself,\nand then a new child is sent by the stork; is it then unnatural for the\nfavourite to wish that the new competitor may have the same fate as the\nearlier one, in order that he may be treated as well as he was before\nduring the interval? Of course this attitude of the child towards the\nyounger infant is under normal circumstances a simple function of the\ndifference of age. After a certain time the maternal instincts of the\ngirl will be excited towards the helpless new-born child.\nFeelings of enmity towards brothers and sisters must occur far more\nfrequently during the age of childhood than is noted by the dull\nobservation of adults.\nIn case of my own children, who followed one another rapidly, I missed\nthe opportunity to make such observations; I am now retrieving it\nthrough my little nephew, whose complete domination was disturbed after\nfifteen months by the arrival of a female competitor. I hear, it is\ntrue, that the young man acts very chivalrously towards his little\nsister, that he kisses her hand and pets her; but in spite of this I\nhave convinced myself that even before the completion of his second year\nhe is using his new facility in language to criticise this person who\nseems superfluous to him. Whenever the conversation turns upon her, he\nchimes in and cries angrily: \u201cToo (l)ittle, too (l)ittle.\u201d During the\nlast few months, since the child has outgrown this unfavourable\ncriticism, owing to its splendid development, he has found another way\nof justifying his insistence that she does not deserve so much\nattention. On all suitable occasions he reminds us, \u201cShe hasn\u2019t any\nteeth.\u201d[BZ] We have all preserved the recollection of the eldest\ndaughter of another sister of mine\u2014how the child which was at that time\nsix years old sought assurance from one aunt after another for an hour\nand a half with the question: \u201cLucy can\u2019t understand that yet, can she?\u201d\nLucy was the competitor, two and a half years younger.\nI have never failed in any of my female patients to find this dream of\nthe death of brothers and sisters denoting exaggerated hostility. I have\nmet with only one exception, which could easily be reinterpreted into a\nconfirmation of the rule. Once in the course of a sitting while I was\nexplaining this condition of affairs to a lady, as it seemed to have a\nbearing upon the symptoms under consideration, she answered, to my\nastonishment, that she had never had such dreams. However, she thought\nof another dream which supposedly had nothing to do with the matter\u2014a\ndream which she had first dreamed at the age of four, when she was the\nyoungest child, and had since dreamed repeatedly. \u201cA great number of\nchildren, all of them the dreamer\u2019s brothers and sisters, and male and\nfemale cousins, were romping about in a meadow. Suddenly they all got\nwings, flew up, and were gone.\u201d She had no idea of the significance of\nthe dream; but it will not be difficult for us to recognise it as a\ndream of the death of all the brothers and sisters, in its original\nform, and little influenced by the censor. I venture to insert the\nfollowing interpretation: At the death of one out of a large number of\nchildren\u2014in this case the children of two brothers were brought up in\ncommon as brothers and sisters\u2014is it not probable that our dreamer, at\nthat time not yet four years old, asked a wise, grown-up person: \u201cWhat\nbecomes of children when they are dead?\u201d The answer probably was: \u201cThey\nget wings and become angels.\u201d According to this explanation all the\nbrothers and sisters and cousins in the dream now have wings like angels\nand\u2014this is the important thing\u2014they fly away. Our little angel-maker\nremains alone, think of it, the only one after such a multitude! The\nfeature that the children are romping about on a meadow points with\nlittle ambiguity to butterflies, as though the child had been led by the\nsame association which induced the ancients to conceive Psyche as having\nthe wings of a butterfly.\nPerhaps some one will now object that, although the inimical impulses of\nchildren towards their brothers and sisters may well enough be admitted,\nhow does the childish disposition arrive at such a height of wickedness\nas to wish death to a competitor or stronger playmate, as though all\ntransgressions could be atoned for only by the death-punishment? Whoever\ntalks in this manner forgets that the childish idea of \u201cbeing dead\u201d has\nlittle else but the words in common with our own. The child knows\nnothing of the horrors of decay, of shivering in the cold grave, of the\nterror of the infinite Nothing, which the grown-up person, as all the\nmyths concerning the Great Beyond testify, finds it so hard to bear in\nhis conception. Fear of death is strange to the child; therefore it\nplays with the horrible word and threatens another child: \u201cIf you do\nthat again you will die, as Francis died,\u201d whereat the poor mother\nshudders, for perhaps she cannot forget that the great majority of\nmortals do not succeed in living beyond the years of childhood. It is\nstill possible, even for a child eight years old, on returning from a\nmuseum of natural history, to say to its mother: \u201cMamma, I love you so;\nif you ever die, I am going to have you stuffed and set you up here in\nthe room so I can always, always see you!\u201d So little does the childish\nconception of being dead resemble our own.[CA]\nBeing dead means for the child, which has been spared the scenes of\nsuffering previous to dying, the same as \u201cbeing gone,\u201d not disturbing\nthe survivors any more. The child does not distinguish the manner and\nmeans by which this absence is brought about, whether by travelling,\nestrangement, or death. If, during the prehistoric years of a child, a\nnurse has been sent away and its mother has died a short while after,\nthe two experiences, as is revealed by analysis, overlap in his memory.\nThe fact that the child does not miss very intensely those who are\nabsent has been realised by many a mother to her sorrow, after she has\nreturned home after a summer journey of several weeks, and has been told\nupon inquiry: \u201cThe children have not asked for their mother a single\ntime.\u201d But if she really goes to that \u201cundiscovered country from whose\nbourn no traveller returns,\u201d the children seem at first to have\nforgotten her, and begin only _subsequently_ to remember the dead\nmother.\nIf, then, the child has motives for wishing the absence of another\nchild, every restraint is lacking which would prevent it from clothing\nthis wish in the form that the child may die, and the psychic reaction\nto the dream of wishing death proves that, in spite of all the\ndifferences in content, the wish in the case of the child is somehow or\nother the same as it is with adults.\nIf now the death-wish of the child towards its brothers and sisters has\nbeen explained by the childish egotism, which causes the child to regard\nits brothers and sisters as competitors, how may we account for the same\nwish towards parents, who bestow love on the child and satisfy its\nwants, and whose preservation it ought to desire from these very\negotistical motives?\nIn the solution of this difficulty we are aided by the experience that\ndreams of the death of parents predominantly refer to that member of the\nparental couple which shares the sex of the dreamer, so that the man\nmostly dreams of the death of his father, the woman of the death of her\nmother. I cannot claim that this happens regularly, but the\npredominating occurrence of this dream in the manner indicated is so\nevident that it must be explained through some factor that is\nuniversally operative. To express the matter boldly, it is as though a\nsexual preference becomes active at an early period, as though the boy\nregards his father as a rival in love, and as though the girl takes the\nsame attitude toward her mother\u2014a rival by getting rid of whom he or she\ncannot but profit.\nBefore rejecting this idea as monstrous, let the reader consider the\nactual relations between parents and children. What the requirements of\nculture and piety demand of this relation must be distinguished from\nwhat daily observation shows us to be the fact. More than one cause for\nhostile feeling is concealed within the relations between parents and\nchildren; the conditions necessary for the actuation of wishes which\ncannot exist in the presence of the censor are most abundantly provided.\nLet us dwell at first upon the relation between father and son. I\nbelieve that the sanctity which we have ascribed to the injunction of\nthe decalogue dulls our perception of reality. Perhaps we hardly dare to\nnotice that the greater part of humanity neglects to obey the fifth\ncommandment. In the lowest as well as in the highest strata of human\nsociety, piety towards parents is in the habit of receding before other\ninterests. The obscure reports which have come to us in mythology and\nlegend from the primeval ages of human society give us an unpleasant\nidea of the power of the father and the ruthlessness with which it was\nused. Kronos devours his children, as the wild boar devours the brood of\nthe sow; Zeus emasculates his father[CB] and takes his place as a ruler.\nThe more despotically the father ruled in the ancient family, the more\nmust the son have taken the position of an enemy, and the greater must\nhave been his impatience, as designated successor, to obtain the mastery\nhimself after his father\u2019s death. Even in our own middle-class family\nthe father is accustomed to aid the development of the germ of hatred\nwhich naturally belongs to the paternal relation by refusing the son the\ndisposal of his own destiny, or the means necessary for this. A\nphysician often has occasion to notice that the son\u2019s grief at the loss\nof his father cannot suppress his satisfaction at the liberty which he\nhas at last obtained. Every father frantically holds on to whatever of\nthe sadly antiquated _potestas patris_ still remains in the society of\nto-day, and every poet who, like Ibsen, puts the ancient strife between\nfather and son in the foreground of his fiction is sure of his effect.\nThe causes of conflict between mother and daughter arise when the\ndaughter grows up and finds a guardian in her mother, while she desires\nsexual freedom, and when, on the other hand, the mother has been warned\nby the budding beauty of her daughter that the time has come for her to\nrenounce sexual claims.\nAll these conditions are notorious and open to everyone\u2019s inspection.\nBut they do not serve to explain dreams of the death of parents found in\nthe case of persons to whom piety towards their parents has long since\ncome to be inviolable. We are furthermore prepared by the preceding\ndiscussion to find that the death-wish towards parents is to be\nexplained by reference to earliest childhood.\nThis conjecture is reaffirmed with a certainty that makes doubt\nimpossible in its application to psychoneurotics through the analyses\nthat have been undertaken with them. It is here found that the sexual\nwishes of the child\u2014in so far as they deserve this designation in their\nembryonic state\u2014awaken at a very early period, and that the first\ninclinations of the girl are directed towards the father, and the first\nchildish cravings of the boy towards the mother. The father thus becomes\nan annoying competitor for the boy, as the mother does for the girl, and\nwe have already shown in the case of brothers and sisters how little it\ntakes for this feeling to lead the child to the death-wish. Sexual\nselection, as a rule, early becomes evident in the parents; it is a\nnatural tendency for the father to indulge the little daughter, and for\nthe mother to take the part of the sons, while both work earnestly for\nthe education of the little ones when the magic of sex does not\nprejudice their judgment. The child is very well aware of any\npartiality, and resists that member of the parental couple who\ndiscourages it. To find love in a grown-up person is for the child not\nonly the satisfaction of a particular craving, but also means that the\nchild\u2019s will is to be yielded to in other respects. Thus the child obeys\nits own sexual impulse, and at the same time re-enforces the feeling\nwhich proceeds from the parents, if it makes a selection among the\nparents that corresponds to theirs.\nMost of the signs of these infantile inclinations are usually\noverlooked; some of them may be observed even after the first years of\nchildhood. An eight-year-old girl of my acquaintance, when her mother is\ncalled from the table, takes advantage of the opportunity to proclaim\nherself her successor. \u201cNow I shall be Mamma; Charles, do you want some\nmore vegetables? Have some, I beg you,\u201d &c. A particularly gifted and\nvivacious girl, not yet four years old, with whom this bit of child\npsychology is unusually transparent, says outright: \u201cNow mother can go\naway; then father must marry me and I shall be his wife.\u201d Nor does this\nwish by any means exclude from child life the possibility that the child\nmay love his mother affectionately. If the little boy is allowed to\nsleep at his mother\u2019s side whenever his father goes on a journey, and if\nafter his father\u2019s return he must go back to the nursery to a person\nwhom he likes far less, the wish may be easily actuated that his father\nmay always be absent, in order that he may keep his place next to his\ndear, beautiful mamma; and the father\u2019s death is obviously a means for\nthe attainment of this wish; for the child\u2019s experience has taught him\nthat \u201cdead\u201d folks, like grandpa, for example, are always absent; they\nnever return.\nAlthough observations upon little children lend themselves, without\nbeing forced, to the proposed interpretation, they do not carry the full\nconviction which psychoanalyses of adult neurotics obtrude upon the\nphysician. The dreams in question are here cited with introductions of\nsuch a nature that their interpretation as wish-dreams becomes\nunavoidable. One day I find a lady sad and weeping. She says: \u201cI do not\nwant to see my relatives any more; they must shudder at me.\u201d Thereupon,\nalmost without any transition, she tells that she remembers a dream,\nwhose significance, of course, she does not know. She dreamed it four\nyears before, and it is as follows: _A fox or a lynx is taking a walk on\nthe roof; then something falls down, or she falls down, and after that\nher mother is carried out of the house dead_\u2014whereat the dreamer cries\nbitterly. No sooner had I informed her that this dream must signify a\nwish from her childhood to see her mother dead, and that it is because\nof this dream that she thinks that her relatives must shudder at her,\nthan she furnished some material for explaining the dream. \u201cLynx-eye\u201d is\nan opprobrious epithet which a street boy once bestowed on her when she\nwas a very small child; when she was three years old a brick had fallen\non her mother\u2019s head so that she bled severely.\nI once had opportunity to make a thorough study of a young girl who\nunderwent several psychic states. In the state of frenzied excitement\nwith which the illness started, the patient showed a very strong\naversion to her mother; she struck and scolded her as soon as she\napproached the bed, while at the same time she remained loving and\nobedient to a much older sister. Then there followed a clear but\nsomewhat apathetic state with very much disturbed sleep. It was in this\nphase that I began to treat her and to analyse her dreams. An enormous\nnumber of these dealt in a more or less abstruse manner with the death\nof the mother; now she was present at the funeral of an old woman, now\nshe saw her sisters sitting at the table dressed in mourning; the\nmeaning of the dreams could not be doubted. During the further progress\nof the convalescence hysterical phobias appeared; the most torturing of\nthese was the idea that something happened to her mother. She was always\nhaving to hurry home from wherever she happened to be in order to\nconvince herself that her mother was still alive. Now this case, in view\nof my other experiences, was very instructive; it showed in polyglot\ntranslations, as it were, the different ways in which the psychic\napparatus reacts to the same exciting idea. In the state of excitement\nwhich I conceive as the overpowering of the second psychic instance, the\nunconscious enmity towards the mother became potent as a motor impulse;\nthen, after calmness set in, following the suppression of the tumult,\nand after the domination of the censor had been restored, this feeling\nof enmity had access only to the province of dreams in order to realise\nthe wish that the mother might die; and after the normal condition had\nbeen still further strengthened, it created the excessive concern for\nthe mother as a hysterical counter-reaction and manifestation of\ndefence. In the light of these considerations it is no longer\ninexplicable why hysterical girls are so often extravagantly attached to\ntheir mothers.\nOn another occasion I had opportunity to get a profound insight into the\nunconscious psychic life of a young man for whom a compulsion-neurosis\nmade life almost unendurable, so that he could not go on the street,\nbecause he was harassed by the obsession that he would kill every one he\nmet. He spent his days in arranging evidence for an alibi in case he\nshould be charged with any murder that might have occurred in the city.\nIt is superfluous to remark that this man was as moral as he was highly\ncultured. The analysis\u2014which, moreover, led to a cure\u2014discovered\nmurderous impulses toward the young man\u2019s somewhat over-strict father as\nthe basis of these disagreeable ideas of compulsion\u2014impulses which, to\nhis great surprise, had received conscious expression when he was seven\nyears old, but which, of course, had originated in much earlier years of\nchildhood. After the painful illness and death of the father, the\nobsessive reproach transferred to strangers in the form of the\nafore-mentioned phobia, appeared when the young man was thirty-one years\nold. Anyone capable of wishing to push his own father from a\nmountain-top into an abyss is certainly not to be trusted to spare the\nlives of those who are not so closely bound to him; he does well to lock\nhimself into his room.\nAccording to my experience, which is now large, parents play a leading\npart in the infantile psychology of all later neurotics, and falling in\nlove with one member of the parental couple and hatred of the other help\nto make up that fateful sum of material furnished by the psychic\nimpulses, which has been formed during the infantile period, and which\nis of such great importance for the symptoms appearing in the later\nneurosis. But I do not think that psychoneurotics are here sharply\ndistinguished from normal human beings, in that they are capable of\ncreating something absolutely new and peculiar to themselves. It is far\nmore probable, as is shown also by occasional observation upon normal\nchildren, that in their loving or hostile wishes towards their parents\npsychoneurotics only show in exaggerated form feelings which are present\nless distinctly and less intensely in the minds of most children.\nAntiquity has furnished us with legendary material to confirm this fact,\nand the deep and universal effectiveness of these legends can only be\nexplained by granting a similar universal applicability to the\nabove-mentioned assumption in infantile psychology.\nI refer to the legend of King Oedipus and the drama of the same name by\nSophocles. Oedipus, the son of Laius, king of Thebes, and of Jocasta, is\nexposed while a suckling, because an oracle has informed the father that\nhis son, who is still unborn, will be his murderer. He is rescued, and\ngrows up as the king\u2019s son at a foreign court, until, being uncertain\nabout his origin, he also consults the oracle, and is advised to avoid\nhis native place, for he is destined to become the murderer of his\nfather and the husband of his mother. On the road leading away from his\nsupposed home he meets King Laius and strikes him dead in a sudden\nquarrel. Then he comes to the gates of Thebes, where he solves the\nriddle of the Sphynx who is barring the way, and he is elected king by\nthe Thebans in gratitude, and is presented with the hand of Jocasta. He\nreigns in peace and honour for a long time, and begets two sons and two\ndaughters upon his unknown mother, until at last a plague breaks out\nwhich causes the Thebans to consult the oracle anew. Here Sophocles\u2019\ntragedy begins. The messengers bring the advice that the plague will\nstop as soon as the murderer of Laius is driven from the country. But\nwhere is he hidden?\n\u201cWhere are they to be found? How shall we trace the perpetrators of so\nold a crime where no conjecture leads to discovery?\u201d[CC]\nThe action of the play now consists merely in a revelation, which is\ngradually completed and artfully delayed\u2014resembling the work of a\npsychoanalysis\u2014of the fact that Oedipus himself is the murderer of\nLaius, and the son of the dead man and of Jocasta. Oedipus, profoundly\nshocked at the monstrosities which he has unknowingly committed, blinds\nhimself and leaves his native place. The oracle has been fulfilled.\nThe _Oedipus Tyrannus_ is a so-called tragedy of fate; its tragic effect\nis said to be found in the opposition between the powerful will of the\ngods and the vain resistance of the human beings who are threatened with\ndestruction; resignation to the will of God and confession of one\u2019s own\nhelplessness is the lesson which the deeply-moved spectator is to learn\nfrom the tragedy. Consequently modern authors have tried to obtain a\nsimilar tragic effect by embodying the same opposition in a story of\ntheir own invention. But spectators have sat unmoved while a curse or an\noracular sentence has been fulfilled on blameless human beings in spite\nof all their struggles; later tragedies of fate have all remained\nwithout effect.\nIf the _Oedipus Tyrannus_ is capable of moving modern men no less than\nit moved the contemporary Greeks, the explanation of this fact cannot\nlie merely in the assumption that the effect of the Greek tragedy is\nbased upon the opposition between fate and human will, but is to be\nsought in the peculiar nature of the material by which the opposition is\nshown. There must be a voice within us which is prepared to recognise\nthe compelling power of fate in _Oedipus_, while we justly condemn the\nsituations occurring in _Die Ahnfrau_ or in other tragedies of later\ndate as arbitrary inventions. And there must be a factor corresponding\nto this inner voice in the story of King Oedipus. His fate moves us only\nfor the reason that it might have been ours, for the oracle has put the\nsame curse upon us before our birth as upon him. Perhaps we are all\ndestined to direct our first sexual impulses towards our mothers, and\nour first hatred and violent washes towards our fathers; our dreams\nconvince us of it. King Oedipus, who has struck his father Laius dead\nand has married his mother Jocasta, is nothing but the realised wish of\nour childhood. But more fortunate than he, we have since succeeded,\nunless we have become psychoneurotics, in withdrawing our sexual\nimpulses from our mothers and in forgetting our jealousy of our fathers.\nWe recoil from the person for whom this primitive wish has been\nfulfilled with all the force of the repression which these wishes have\nsuffered within us. By his analysis, showing us the guilt of Oedipus,\nthe poet urges us to recognise our own inner self, in which these\nimpulses, even if suppressed, are still present. The comparison with\nwhich the chorus leaves us\u2014\n\u201c... Behold! this Oedipus, who unravelled the famous riddle and who\nwas a man of eminent virtue; a man who trusted neither to popularity\nnor to the fortune of his citizens; see how great a storm of adversity\nhath at last overtaken him\u201d (Act v. sc. 4).\nThis warning applies to ourselves and to our pride, to us, who have\ngrown so wise and so powerful in our own estimation since the years of\nour childhood. Like Oedipus, we live in ignorance of the wishes that\noffend morality, wishes which nature has forced upon us, and after the\nrevelation of which we want to avert every glance from the scenes of our\nchildhood.\nIn the very text of Sophocles\u2019 tragedy there is an unmistakable\nreference to the fact that the Oedipus legend originates in an extremely\nold dream material, which consists of the painful disturbance of the\nrelation towards one\u2019s parents by means of the first impulses of\nsexuality. Jocasta comforts Oedipus\u2014who is not yet enlightened, but who\nhas become worried on account of the oracle\u2014by mentioning to him the\ndream which is dreamt by so many people, though she attaches no\nsignificance to it\u2014\n\u201cFor it hath already been the lot of many men in dreams to think\nthemselves partners of their mother\u2019s bed. But he passes most easily\nthrough life to whom these circumstances are trifles\u201d (Act iv. sc. 3).\nThe dream of having sexual intercourse with one\u2019s mother occurred at\nthat time, as it does to-day, to many people, who tell it with\nindignation and astonishment. As may be understood, it is the key to the\ntragedy and the complement to the dream of the death of the father. The\nstory of Oedipus is the reaction of the imagination to these two typical\ndreams, and just as the dream when occurring to an adult is experienced\nwith feelings of resistance, so the legend must contain terror and\nself-chastisement. The appearance which it further assumes is the result\nof an uncomprehending secondary elaboration which tries to make it serve\ntheological purposes (_cf._ the dream material of exhibitionism, p.\n206). The attempt to reconcile divine omnipotence with human\nresponsibility must, of course, fail with this material as with every\nother.[CD]\nI must not leave the typical dream of the death of dear relatives\nwithout somewhat further elucidating the subject of their significance\nfor the theory of the dream in general. These dreams show us a\nrealisation of the very unusual case where the dream thought, which has\nbeen created by the repressed wish, completely escapes the censor, and\nis transferred to the dream without alteration. There must be present\npeculiar conditions making possible such an outcome. I find\ncircumstances favourable to these dreams in the two following factors:\nFirst, there is no wish which we believe further from us; we believe\nsuch a wish \u201cwould never occur to us in a dream\u201d; the dream censor is\ntherefore not prepared for this monstrosity, just as the legislation of\nSolon was incapable of establishing a punishment for patricide.\nSecondly, the repressed and unsuspected wish is in just this case\nparticularly often met by a fragment of the day\u2019s experience in the\nshape of a concern about the life of the beloved person. This concern\ncannot be registered in the dream by any other means than by taking\nadvantage of the wish that has the same content; but it is possible for\nthe wish to mask itself behind the concern which has been awakened\nduring the day. If one is inclined to think all this a more simple\nprocess, and that one merely continues during the night and in dreams\nwhat one has been concerned with during the day, the dream of the death\nof beloved persons is removed from all connection with dream\nexplanation, and an easily reducible problem is uselessly retained.\nIt is also instructive to trace the relation of these dreams to anxiety\ndreams. In the dream of the death of dear persons the repressed wish has\nfound a way of avoiding the censor, and the distortion which it causes.\nIn this case the inevitable concomitant manifestation is that\ndisagreeable sensations are felt in the dream. Thus the dream of fear is\nbrought about only when the censor is entirely or partially overpowered,\nand, on the other hand, the overpowering of the censor is made easier\nwhen fear has already been furnished by somatic sources. Thus it becomes\nobvious for what purpose the censor performs its office and practises\ndream distortion; it does this _in order to prevent the development of\nfear or other forms of disagreeable emotion_.\nI have spoken above of the egotism of the infantile mind, and I may now\nresume this subject in order to suggest that dreams preserve this\ncharacteristic\u2014thus showing their connection with infantile life. Every\ndream is absolutely egotistical; in every dream the beloved ego appears,\neven though it may be in a disguised form. The wishes that are realised\nin dreams are regularly the wishes of this ego; it is only a deceptive\nappearance if interest in another person is thought to have caused the\ndream. I shall subject to analysis several examples which appear to\ncontradict this assertion.\nI. A boy not yet four years old relates the following: _He saw a large\ndish garnished, and upon it a large piece of roast meat, and the meat\nwas all of a sudden\u2014not cut to pieces\u2014but eaten up. He did not see the\nperson who ate it._[CE]\nWho may this strange person be of whose luxurious repast this little\nfellow dreams? The experiences of the day must give us the explanation\nof this. For a few days the boy had been living on a diet of milk\naccording to the doctor\u2019s prescription; but on the evening of the day\nbefore the dream he had been naughty, and as a punishment he had been\ndeprived of his evening meal. He had already undergone one such\nhunger-cure, and had acted very bravely. He knew that he would get\nnothing to eat, but he did not dare to indicate by a word that he was\nhungry. Education was beginning to have its influence upon him; this is\nexpressed even in the dream which shows the beginnings of dream\ndisfigurement. There is no doubt that he himself is the person whose\nwishes are directed toward this abundant meal, and a meal of roast meat\nat that. But since he knows that this is forbidden him, he does not\ndare, as children do in the dream (_cf._ the dream about strawberries of\nmy little Anna, p. 110), to sit down to the meal himself. The person\nremains anonymous.\nII. Once I dream that I see on the show-table of a book store a new\nnumber in the Book-lovers\u2019 Collection\u2014the collection which I am in the\nhabit of buying (art monographs, monographs on the history of the world,\nfamous art centres, &c.). _The new collection is called Famous Orators\n(or Orations), and the first number bears the name of Doctor Lecher._\nIn the course of analysis it appears improbable that the fame of Dr.\nLecher, the long-winded orator of the German Opposition, should occupy\nmy thoughts while I am dreaming. The fact is that, a few days before, I\nundertook the psychic cure of some new patients, and was now forced to\ntalk for from ten to twelve hours a day. Thus I myself am the\nlong-winded orator.\nIII. Upon another occasion I dream that a teacher of my acquaintance at\nthe university says: _My son, the Myopic_. Then there follows a dialogue\nconsisting of short speeches and replies. A third portion of the dream\nfollows in which I and my sons appear, and as far as the latent dream\ncontent is concerned, father, son, and Professor M. are alike only lay\nfigures to represent me and my eldest son. I shall consider this dream\nagain further on because of another peculiarity.\nIV. The following dream gives an example of really base egotistical\nfeelings, which are concealed behind affectionate concern:\n_My friend Otto looks ill, his face is brown and his eyes bulge._\nOtto is my family physician, to whom I owe a debt greater than I can\never hope to repay, since he has guarded the health of my children for\nyears. He has treated them successfully when they were taken sick, and\nbesides that he has given them presents on all occasions which gave him\nany excuse for doing so. He came for a visit on the day of the dream,\nand my wife noticed that he looked tired and exhausted. Then comes my\ndream at night, and attributes to him a few of the symptoms of Basedow\u2019s\ndisease. Any one disregarding my rules for dream interpretation would\nunderstand this dream to mean that I am concerned about the health of my\nfriend, and that this concern is realised in the dream. It would thus be\na contradiction not only of the assertion that the dream is a\nwish-fulfilment, but also of the assertion that it is accessible only to\negotistic impulses. But let the person who interprets the dream in this\nmanner explain to me why I fear that Otto has Basedow\u2019s disease, for\nwhich diagnosis his appearance does not give the slightest\njustification? As opposed to this, my analysis furnishes the following\nmaterial, taken from an occurrence which happened six years ago. A small\nparty of us, including Professor R., were driving in profound darkness\nthrough the forest of N., which is several hours distant from our\ncountry home. The coachman, who was not quite sober, threw us and the\nwagon down a bank, and it was only by a lucky accident that we all\nescaped unhurt. But we were forced to spend the night at the nearest\ninn, where the news of our accident awakened great sympathy. A\ngentleman, who showed unmistakable signs of the morbus Basedowii\u2014nothing\nbut a brownish colour of the skin of the face and bulging eyes, no\ngoitre\u2014placed himself entirely at our disposal and asked what he could\ndo for us. Professor R. answered in his decided way: \u201cNothing but lend\nme a night-shirt.\u201d Whereupon our generous friend replied: \u201cI am sorry\nbut I cannot do that,\u201d and went away.\nIn continuing the analysis, it occurs to me that Basedow is the name not\nonly of a physician, but also of a famous educator. (Now that I am awake\nI do not feel quite sure of this fact.) My friend Otto is the person\nwhom I have asked to take charge of the physical education of my\nchildren\u2014especially during the age of puberty (hence the night-shirt)\u2014in\ncase anything should happen to me. By seeing Otto in the dream with the\nmorbid symptoms of our above-mentioned generous benefactor, I apparently\nmean to say, \u201cIf anything happens to me, just as little is to be\nexpected for my children from him as was to be expected then from Baron\nL., in spite of his well-meaning offers.\u201d The egotistical turn of this\ndream ought now to be clear.[CF]\nBut where is the wish-fulfilment to be found? It is not in the vengeance\nsecured upon my friend Otto, whose fate it seems to be to receive\nill-treatment in my dreams, but in the following circumstances: In\nrepresenting Otto in the dream as Baron L., I have at the same time\nidentified myself with some one else, that is to say, with Professor R.,\nfor I have asked something of Otto, just as R. asked something of Baron\nL. at the time of the occurrence which has been mentioned. And that is\nthe point. For Professor R. has pursued his way independently outside\nthe schools, somewhat as I have done, and has only in later years\nreceived the title which he earned long ago. I am therefore again\nwishing to be a professor! The very phrase \u201cin later years\u201d is the\nfulfilment of wish, for it signifies that I shall live long enough to\npilot my boy through the age of puberty myself.\nI gave only a brief account of the other forms of typical dreams in the\nfirst edition of this book, because an insufficient amount of good\nmaterial was at my disposal. My experience, which has since been\nincreased, now makes it possible for me to divide these dreams into two\nbroad classes\u2014first, those which really have the same meaning every\ntime, and secondly, those which must be subjected to the most widely\ndifferent interpretations in spite of their identical or similar\ncontent. Among the typical dreams of the first sort I shall closely\nconsider the examination dream and the so-called dream of dental\nirritation.\nEvery one who has received his degree after having passed the final\ncollege examination, complains of the ruthlessness with which he is\npursued by the anxiety dream that he will fail, that he must repeat his\nwork, &c. For the holder of the university degree this typical dream is\nreplaced by another, which represents to him that he has to pass the\nexamination for the doctor\u2019s degree, and against which he vainly raises\nthe objection in his sleep that he has already been practising for\nyears\u2014that he is already a university instructor or the head of a law\nfirm. These are the ineradicable memories of the punishments which we\nsuffered when we were children for misdeeds which we had\ncommitted\u2014memories which were revived in us on that _dies irae, dies\nilla_ of the severe examination at the two critical junctures in our\nstudies. The \u201cexamination-phobia\u201d of neurotics is also strengthened by\nthis childish fear. After we have ceased to be schoolboys it is no\nlonger our parents and guardians as at first, or our teachers as later\non, who see to our punishment; the inexorable chain of causes and\neffects in life has taken over our further education. Now we dream of\nexaminations for graduation or for the doctor\u2019s degree\u2014and who has not\nbeen faint-hearted in these tests, even though he belonged to the\nrighteous?\u2014whenever we fear that an outcome will punish us because we\nhave not done something, or because we have not accomplished something\nas we should\u2014in short whenever we feel the weight of responsibility.\nI owe the actual explanation of examination dreams to a remark made by a\nwell-informed colleague, who once asserted in a scientific discussion\nthat in his experience the examination dream occurs only to persons who\nhave passed the examination, never to those who have gone to pieces on\nit. The anxiety dream of the examination, which occurs, as is being more\nand more corroborated, when the dreamer is looking forward to a\nresponsible action on his part the next day and the possibility of\ndisgrace, has therefore probably selected an occasion in the past where\nthe great anxiety has shown itself to have been without justification\nand has been contradicted by the result. This would be a very striking\nexample of a misconception of the dream content on the part of the\nwaking instance. The objection to the dream, which is conceived as the\nindignant protest, \u201cBut I am already a doctor,\u201d &c., would be in reality\na consolation which the dreams offer, and which would therefore be to\nthe following effect: \u201cDo not be afraid of the morrow; think of the fear\nwhich you had before the final examination, and yet nothing came of it.\nYou are a doctor this minute,\u201d &c. The fear, however, which we attribute\nto the dream, originates in the remnants of daily experience.\nThe tests of this explanation which I was able to make in my own case\nand in that of others, although they were not sufficiently numerous,\nhave been altogether successful. I failed, for example, in the\nexamination for the doctor\u2019s degree in legal medicine; never once have I\nbeen concerned about this matter in my dreams, while I have often enough\nbeen examined in botany, zoology, or chemistry, in which subjects I took\nthe examinations with well-founded anxiety, but escaped punishment\nthrough the clemency of fortune or of the examiner. In my dreams of\ncollege examination, I am regularly examined in history, a subject which\nI passed brilliantly at the time, but only, I must admit, because my\ngood-natured professor\u2014my one-eyed benefactor in another dream (_cf._ p.\n12)\u2014did not overlook the fact that on the list of questions I had\ncrossed out the second of three questions as an indication that he\nshould not insist on it. One of my patients, who withdrew before the\nfinal college examinations and made them up later, but who failed in the\nofficer\u2019s examination and did not become an officer, tells me that he\ndreams about the former examination often enough, but never about the\nlatter.\nThe above-mentioned colleague (Dr. Stekel of Vienna) calls attention to\nthe double meaning of the word \u201cMatura\u201d (_Matura_\u2014examination for\ncollege degree: mature, ripe), and claims that he has observed that\nexamination dreams occur very frequently when a sexual test is set for\nthe following day, in which, therefore, the disgrace which is feared\nmight consist in the manifestation of slight potency. A German colleague\ntakes exception to this, as it appears, justly, on the ground that this\nexamination is denominated in Germany the Abiturium and hence lacks this\ndouble meaning.\nOn account of their similar affective impression dreams of missing a\ntrain deserve to be placed next to examination dreams. Their explanation\nalso justifies this relationship. They are consolation dreams directed\nagainst another feeling of fear perceived in the dream, the fear of\ndying. \u201cTo depart\u201d is one of the most frequent and one of the most\neasily reached symbols of death. The dream thus says consolingly:\n\u201cCompose yourself, you are not going to die (to depart),\u201d just as the\nexamination dream calms us by saying \u201cFear not, nothing will happen to\nyou even this time.\u201d The difficulty in understanding both kinds of\ndreams is due to the fact that the feeling of anxiety is directly\nconnected with the expression of consolation. Stekel treats fully the\nsymbolisms of death in his recently published book _Die Sprache des\nTraumes_.\nThe meaning of the \u201cdreams of dental irritation,\u201d which I have had to\nanalyse often enough with my patients, escaped me for a long time,\nbecause, much to my astonishment, resistances that were altogether too\ngreat obstructed their interpretation.\nAt last overwhelming evidence convinced me that, in the case of men,\nnothing else than cravings for masturbation from the time of puberty\nfurnishes the motive power for these dreams. I shall analyse two such\ndreams, one of which is likewise \u201ca dream of flight.\u201d The two dreams are\nof the same person\u2014a young man with a strong homosexuality, which,\nhowever, has been repressed in life.\n_He is witnessing a performance of_ Fidelio _from the parquette of the\nopera house; he is sitting next to L., whose personality is congenial to\nhim, and whose friendship he would like to have. He suddenly flies\ndiagonally clear across the parquette; he then puts his hand in his\nmouth and draws out two of his teeth._\nHe himself describes the flight by saying it was as if he were \u201cthrown\u201d\ninto the air. As it was a performance of _Fidelio_ he recalls the poet\u2019s\nwords:\n\u201cHe who a charming wife acquired\u2014\u2014\u201d\nBut even the acquisition of a charming wife is not among the wishes of\nthe dreamer. Two other verses would be more appropriate:\n_\u201cHe who succeeds in the lucky (big) throw,\nA friend of a friend to be....\u201d_\nThe dream thus contains the \u201clucky (big) throw,\u201d which is not, however,\na wish-fulfilment only. It also conceals the painful reflection that in\nhis striving after friendship he has often had the misfortune to be\n\u201cthrown down,\u201d and the fear lest this fate may be repeated in the case\nof the young man next whom he has enjoyed the performance of _Fidelio_.\nThis is now followed by a confession which quite puts this refined\ndreamer to shame, to the effect that once, after such a rejection on the\npart of a friend, out of burning desire he merged into sexual excitement\nand masturbated twice in succession.\nThe other dream is as follows: _Two professors of the university who are\nknown to him are treating him in my stead. One of them does something\nwith his penis; he fears an operation. The other one thrusts an iron bar\nat his mouth so that he loses two teeth. He is bound with four silken\ncloths._\nThe sexual significance of this dream can hardly be doubted. The silken\ncloths are equivalent to an identification with a homosexual of his\nacquaintance. The dreamer, who has never achieved coition, but who has\nnever actually sought sexual intercourse with men, conceives sexual\nintercourse after the model of the masturbation which he was once taught\nduring the time of puberty.\nI believe that the frequent modifications of the typical dream of dental\nirritation\u2014that, for example, of another person drawing the tooth from\nthe dreamer\u2019s mouth, are made intelligible by means of the same\nexplanation. It may, however, be difficult to see how \u201cdental\nirritation\u201d can come to have this significance. I may then call\nattention to a transference from below to above which occurs very\nfrequently. This transference is at the service of sexual repression,\nand by means of it all kinds of sensations and intentions occurring in\nhysteria which ought to be enacted in the genitals can be realised upon\nless objectionable parts of the body. It is also a case of such\ntransference when the genitals are replaced by the face in the symbolism\nof unconscious thought. This is assisted by the fact that the buttocks\nresemble the cheeks, and also by the usage of language which calls the\nnymph\u00e6 \u201clips,\u201d as resembling those that enclose the opening of the\nmouth. The nose is compared to the penis in numerous allusions, and in\none place as in the other the presence of hair completes the\nresemblance. Only one part of the anatomy\u2014the teeth\u2014are beyond all\npossibility of being compared with anything, and it is just this\ncoincidence of agreement and disagreement which makes the teeth suitable\nfor representation under pressure of sexual repression.\nI do not wish to claim that the interpretation of the dream of dental\nirritation as a dream of masturbation, the justification of which I\ncannot doubt, has been freed of all obscurity.[CG] I carry the\nexplanation as far as I am able, and must leave the rest unsolved. But I\nmust also refer to another connection revealed by an idiomatic\nexpression. In our country there is in use an indelicate designation for\nthe act of masturbation, namely: To pull one out, or to pull one\ndown.[CH] I am unable to say whence these colloquialisms originate, and\non what symbolisms they are based, but the teeth would well fit in with\nthe first of the two.[CI]\nDreams in which one is flying or hovering, falling, swimming, or the\nlike, belong to the second group of typical dreams. What do these dreams\nsignify? A general statement on this point cannot be made. They signify\nsomething different in each case, as we shall hear: only the sensational\nmaterial which they contain always comes from the same source.\nIt is necessary to conclude, from the material obtained in\npsychoanalysis, that these dreams repeat impressions from childhood\u2014that\nis, that they refer to the movement games which have such extraordinary\nattractions for the child. What uncle has never made a child fly by\nrunning across the room with it with arms outstretched, or has never\nplayed falling with it by rocking it on his knee and then suddenly\nstretching out his leg, or by lifting it up high and then pretending to\nwithdraw support. At this the children shout with joy, and demand more\nuntiringly, especially if there is a little fright and dizziness\nattached to it; in after years they create a repetition of this in the\ndream, but in the dream they omit the hands which have held them, so\nthat they now freely float and fall. The fondness of all small children\nfor games like rocking and see-sawing is well known; and if they see\ngymnastic tricks at the circus their recollection of this rocking is\nrefreshed. With some boys the hysterical attack consists simply in the\nreproduction of such tricks, which they accomplish with great skill. Not\ninfrequently sexual sensations are excited by these movement games,\nharmless as they are in themselves.[CJ] To express the idea by a word\nwhich is current among us, and which covers all of these matters: It is\nthe wild playing (\u201cHetzen\u201d) of childhood which dreams about flying,\nfalling, vertigo, and the like repeat, and the voluptuous feelings of\nwhich have now been turned into fear. But as every mother knows, the\nwild playing of children has often enough culminated in quarrelling and\ntears.\nI therefore have good reason for rejecting the explanation that the\ncondition of our dermal sensations during sleep, the sensations caused\nby the movements of the lungs, and the like, give rise to dreams of\nflying and falling. I see that these very sensations have been\nreproduced from the memory with which the dream is concerned\u2014that they\nare, therefore, a part of the dream content and not of the dream\nsources.\nThis material, similar in its character and origin consisting of\nsensations of motion, is now used for the representation of the most\nmanifold dream thoughts. Dreams of flying, for the most part\ncharacterised by delight, require the most widely different\ninterpretations\u2014altogether special interpretations in the case of some\npersons, and even interpretations of a typical nature in that of others.\nOne of my patients was in the habit of dreaming very often that she was\nsuspended above the street at a certain height, without touching the\nground. She had grown only to a very small stature, and shunned every\nkind of contamination which accompanies intercourse with human beings.\nHer dream of suspension fulfilled both of her wishes, by raising her\nfeet from the ground and by allowing her head to tower in the upper\nregions. In the case of other female dreamers the dream of flying had\nthe significance of a longing: If I were a little bird; others thus\nbecome angels at night because they have missed being called that by\nday. The intimate connection between flying and the idea of a bird makes\nit comprehensible that the dream of flying in the case of men usually\nhas a significance of coarse sensuality.[CK] We shall also not be\nsurprised to hear that this or that dreamer is always very proud of his\nability to fly.\nDr. Paul Federn (Vienna) has propounded the fascinating theory that a\ngreat many flying dreams are erection dreams, since the remarkable\nphenomena of erection which so constantly occupy the human phantasy must\nstrongly impress upon it a notion of the suspension of gravity (_cf._\nthe winged phalli of the ancients).\nDreams of falling are most frequently characterised by fear. Their\ninterpretation, when they occur in women, is subject to no difficulty\nbecause women always accept the symbolic sense of falling, which is a\ncircumlocution for the indulgence of an erotic temptation. We have not\nyet exhausted the infantile sources of the dream of falling; nearly all\nchildren have fallen occasionally, and then been picked up and fondled;\nif they fell out of bed at night, they were picked up by their nurse and\ntaken into her bed.\nPeople who dream often of swimming, of cleaving the waves, with great\nenjoyment, &c., have usually been persons who wetted their beds, and\nthey now repeat in the dream a pleasure which they have long since\nlearned to forgo. We shall soon learn from one example or another to\nwhat representation the dreams of swimming easily lend themselves.\nThe interpretation of dreams about fire justifies a prohibition of the\nnursery which forbids children to burn matches in order that they may\nnot wet the bed at night. They too are based on the reminiscence of\n_enuresis nocturnus_ of childhood. In the _Bruchst\u00fcck einer\nHysterieanalyse_, 1905,[CL] I have given the complete analysis and\nsynthesis of such a fire-dream in connection with the infantile history\nof the dreamer, and have shown to the representation of what emotions\nthis infantile material has been utilised in maturer years.\nIt would be possible to cite a considerable number of other \u201ctypical\u201d\ndreams, if these are understood to refer to the frequent recurrence of\nthe same manifest dream content in the case of different dreamers, as,\nfor example: dreams of passing through narrow alleys, of walking through\na whole suite of rooms; dreams of the nocturnal burglar against whom\nnervous people direct precautionary measures before going to sleep;\ndreams of being chased by wild animals (bulls, horses), or of being\nthreatened with knives, daggers, and lances. The last two are\ncharacteristic as the manifest dream content of persons suffering from\nanxiety, &c. An investigation dealing especially with this material\nwould be well worth while. In lieu of this I have two remarks to offer,\nwhich, however, do not apply exclusively to typical dreams.\nI. The more one is occupied with the solution of dreams, the more\nwilling one must become to acknowledge that the majority of the dreams\nof adults treat of sexual material and give expression to erotic wishes.\nOnly one who really analyses dreams, that is to say, who pushes forward\nfrom their manifest content to the latent dream thoughts, can form an\nopinion on this subject\u2014never the person who is satisfied with\nregistering the manifest content (as, for example, N\u00e4cke in his works on\nsexual dreams). Let us recognise at once that this fact is not to be\nwondered at, but that it is in complete harmony with the fundamental\nassumptions of dream explanation. No other impulse has had to undergo so\nmuch suppression from the time of childhood as the sex impulse in its\nnumerous components,[CM] from no other impulse have survived so many and\nsuch intense unconscious wishes, which now act in the sleeping state in\nsuch a manner as to produce dreams. In dream interpretation, this\nsignificance of sexual complexes must never be forgotten, nor must they,\nof course, be exaggerated to the point of being considered exclusive.\nOf many dreams it can be ascertained by a careful interpretation that\nthey are even to be taken bisexually, inasmuch as they result in an\nirrefutable secondary interpretation in which they realise homosexual\nfeelings\u2014that is, feelings that are common to the normal sexual activity\nof the dreaming person. But that all dreams are to be interpreted\nbisexually, as maintained by W. Stekel,[CN] and Alf. Adler,[CO] seems to\nme to be a generalisation as indemonstrable as it is improbable, which I\nshould not like to support. Above all I should not know how to dispose\nof the apparent fact that there are many dreams satisfying other than\u2014in\nthe widest sense\u2014erotic needs, as dreams of hunger, thirst, convenience,\n&c. Likewise the similar assertions \u201cthat behind every dream one finds\nthe death sentence\u201d (Stekel), and that every dream shows \u201ca continuation\nfrom the feminine to the masculine line\u201d (Adler), seem to me to proceed\nfar beyond what is admissible in the interpretation of dreams.\nWe have already asserted elsewhere that dreams which are conspicuously\ninnocent invariably embody coarse erotic wishes, and we might confirm\nthis by means of numerous fresh examples. But many dreams which appear\nindifferent, and which would never be suspected of any particular\nsignificance, can be traced back, after analysis, to unmistakably sexual\nwish-feelings, which are often of an unexpected nature. For example, who\nwould suspect a sexual wish in the following dream until the\ninterpretation had been worked out? The dreamer relates: _Between two\nstately palaces stands a little house, receding somewhat, whose doors\nare closed. My wife leads me a little way along the street up to the\nlittle house, and pushes in the door, and then I slip quickly and easily\ninto the interior of a courtyard that slants obliquely upwards._\nAnyone who has had experience in the translating of dreams will, of\ncourse, immediately perceive that penetrating into narrow spaces, and\nopening locked doors, belong to the commonest sexual symbolism, and will\neasily find in this dream a representation of attempted coition from\nbehind (between the two stately buttocks of the female body). The narrow\nslanting passage is of course the vagina; the assistance attributed to\nthe wife of the dreamer requires the interpretation that in reality it\nis only consideration for the wife which is responsible for the\ndetention from such an attempt. Moreover, inquiry shows that on the\nprevious day a young girl had entered the household of the dreamer who\nhad pleased him, and who had given him the impression that she would not\nbe altogether opposed to an approach of this sort. The little house\nbetween the two palaces is taken from a reminiscence of the Hradschin in\nPrague, and thus points again to the girl who is a native of that city.\nIf with my patients I emphasise the frequency of the Oedipus dream\u2014of\nhaving sexual intercourse with one\u2019s mother\u2014I get the answer: \u201cI cannot\nremember such a dream.\u201d Immediately afterwards, however, there arises\nthe recollection of another disguised and indifferent dream, which has\nbeen dreamed repeatedly by the patient, and the analysis shows it to be\na dream of this same content\u2014that is, another Oedipus dream. I can\nassure the reader that veiled dreams of sexual intercourse with the\nmother are a great deal more frequent than open ones to the same\neffect.[CP]\nThere are dreams about landscapes and localities in which emphasis is\nalways laid upon the assurance: \u201cI have been there before.\u201d In this case\nthe locality is always the genital organ of the mother; it can indeed be\nasserted with such certainty of no other locality that one \u201chas been\nthere before.\u201d\nA large number of dreams, often full of fear, which are concerned with\npassing through narrow spaces or with staying in the water, are based\nupon fancies about the embryonic life, about the sojourn in the mother\u2019s\nwomb, and about the act of birth. The following is the dream of a young\nman who in his fancy has already while in embryo taken advantage of his\nopportunity to spy upon an act of coition between his parents.\n\u201c_He is in a deep shaft, in which there is a window, as in the Semmering\nTunnel. At first he sees an empty landscape through this window, and\nthen he composes a picture into it, which is immediately at hand and\nwhich fills out the empty space. The picture represents a field which is\nbeing thoroughly harrowed by an implement, and the delightful air, the\naccompanying idea of hard work, and the bluish-black clods of earth make\na pleasant impression. He then goes on and sees a primary school\nopened ... and he is surprised that so much attention is devoted in it\nto the sexual feelings of the child, which makes him think of me._\u201d\nHere is a pretty water-dream of a female patient, which was turned to\nextraordinary account in the course of treatment.\n_At her summer resort at the ... Lake, she hurls herself into the dark\nwater at a place where the pale moon is reflected in the water._\nDreams of this sort are parturition dreams; their interpretation is\naccomplished by reversing the fact reported in the manifest dream\ncontent; thus, instead of \u201cthrowing one\u2019s self into the water,\u201d read\n\u201ccoming out of the water,\u201d that is, \u201cbeing born.\u201d The place from which\none is born is recognised if one thinks of the bad sense of the French\n\u201cla lune.\u201d The pale moon thus becomes the white \u201cbottom\u201d (Popo), which\nthe child soon recognises as the place from which it came. Now what can\nbe the meaning of the patient\u2019s wishing to be born at her summer resort?\nI asked the dreamer this, and she answered without hesitation: \u201cHasn\u2019t\nthe treatment made me as though I were born again?\u201d Thus the dream\nbecomes an invitation to continue the cure at this summer resort, that\nis, to visit her there; perhaps it also contains a very bashful allusion\nto the wish to become a mother herself.[CQ]\nAnother dream of parturition, with its interpretation, I take from the\nwork of E. Jones.[95] \u201c_She stood at the seashore watching a small boy,\nwho seemed to be hers, wading into the water. This he did till the water\ncovered him, and she could only see his head bobbing up and down near\nthe surface. The scene then changed to the crowded hall of a hotel. Her\nhusband left her, and she \u2018entered into conversation with\u2019 a stranger._\u201d\nThe second half of the dream was discovered in the analysis to represent\na flight from her husband, and the entering into intimate relations with\na third person, behind whom was plainly indicated Mr. X.\u2019s brother\nmentioned in a former dream. The first part of the dream was a fairly\nevident birth phantasy. In dreams as in mythology, the delivery of a\nchild _from_ the uterine waters is commonly presented by distortion as\nthe entry of the child _into_ water; among many others, the births of\nAdonis, Osiris, Moses, and Bacchus are well-known illustrations of this.\nThe bobbing up and down of the head in the water at once recalled to the\npatient the sensation of quickening she had experienced in her only\npregnancy. Thinking of the boy going into the water induced a reverie in\nwhich she saw herself taking him out of the water, carrying him into the\nnursery, washing him and dressing him, and installing him in her\nhousehold.\nThe second half of the dream, therefore, represents thoughts concerning\nthe elopement, which belonged to the first half of the underlying latent\ncontent; the first half of the dream corresponded with the second half\nof the latent content, the birth phantasy. Besides this inversion in\norder, further inversions took place in each half of the dream. In the\nfirst half the child _entered_ the water, and then his head bobbed; in\nthe underlying dream thoughts first the quickening occurred, and then\nthe child left the water (a double inversion). In the second half her\nhusband left her; in the dream thoughts she left her husband.\nAnother parturition dream is related by Abraham[79] of a young woman\nlooking forward to her first confinement (p. 22): From a place in the\nfloor of the house a subterranean canal leads directly into the water\n(parturition path, amniotic liquor). She lifts up a trap in the floor,\nand there immediately appears a creature dressed in a brownish fur,\nwhich almost resembles a seal. This creature changes into the younger\nbrother of the dreamer, to whom she has always stood in maternal\nrelationship.\nDreams of \u201csaving\u201d are connected with parturition dreams. To save,\nespecially to save from the water, is equivalent to giving birth when\ndreamed by a woman; this sense is, however, modified when the dreamer is\na man.[CR]\nRobbers, burglars at night, and ghosts, of which we are afraid before\ngoing to bed, and which occasionally even disturb our sleep, originate\nin one and the same childish reminiscence. They are the nightly visitors\nwho have awakened the child to set it on the chamber so that it may not\nwet the bed, or have lifted the cover in order to see clearly how the\nchild is holding its hands while sleeping. I have been able to induce an\nexact recollection of the nocturnal visitor in the analysis of some of\nthese anxiety dreams. The robbers were always the father, the ghosts\nmore probably corresponded to feminine persons with white night-gowns.\nII. When one has become familiar with the abundant use of symbolism for\nthe representation of sexual material in dreams, one naturally raises\nthe question whether there are not many of these symbols which appear\nonce and for all with a firmly established significance like the signs\nin stenography; and one is tempted to compile a new dream-book according\nto the cipher method. In this connection it may be remarked that this\nsymbolism does not belong peculiarly to the dream, but rather to\nunconscious thinking, particularly that of the masses, and it is to be\nfound in greater perfection in the folk-lore, in the myths, legends, and\nmanners of speech, in the proverbial sayings, and in the current\nwitticisms of a nation than in its dreams.[CS]\nThe dream takes advantage of this symbolism in order to give a disguised\nrepresentation to its latent thoughts. Among the symbols which are used\nin this manner there are of course many which regularly, or almost\nregularly, mean the same thing. Only it is necessary to keep in mind the\ncurious plasticity of psychic material. Now and then a symbol in the\ndream content may have to be interpreted not symbolically, but according\nto its real meaning; at another time the dreamer, owing to a peculiar\nset of recollections, may create for himself the right to use anything\nwhatever as a sexual symbol, though it is not ordinarily used in that\nway. Nor are the most frequently used sexual symbols unambiguous every\ntime.\nAfter these limitations and reservations I may call attention to the\nfollowing: Emperor and Empress (King and Queen) in most cases really\nrepresent the parents of the dreamer;[CT] the dreamer himself or herself\nis the prince or princess. All elongated objects, sticks, tree-trunks,\nand umbrellas (on account of the stretching-up which might be compared\nto an erection), all elongated and sharp weapons, knives, daggers, and\npikes, are intended to represent the male member. A frequent, not very\nintelligible, symbol for the same is a nail-file (on account of the\nrubbing and scraping?). Little cases, boxes, caskets, closets, and\nstoves correspond to the female part. The symbolism of lock and key has\nbeen very gracefully employed by Uhland in his song about the \u201cGrafen\nEberstein,\u201d to make a common smutty joke. The dream of walking through a\nrow of rooms is a brothel or harem dream. Staircases, ladders, and\nflights of stairs, or climbing on these, either upwards or downwards,\nare symbolic representations of the sexual act.[CU] Smooth walls over\nwhich one is climbing, fa\u00e7ades of houses upon which one is letting\noneself down, frequently under great anxiety, correspond to the erect\nhuman body, and probably repeat in the dream reminiscences of the upward\nclimbing of little children on their parents or foster parents. \u201cSmooth\u201d\nwalls are men. Often in a dream of anxiety one is holding on firmly to\nsome projection from a house. Tables, set tables, and boards are women,\nperhaps on account of the opposition which does away with the bodily\ncontours. Since \u201cbed and board\u201d (_mensa et thorus_) constitute marriage,\nthe former are often put for the latter in the dream, and as far as\npracticable the sexual presentation complex is transposed to the eating\ncomplex. Of articles of dress the woman\u2019s hat may frequently be\ndefinitely interpreted as the male genital. In dreams of men one often\nfinds the cravat as a symbol for the penis; this indeed is not only\nbecause cravats hang down long, and are characteristic of the man, but\nalso because one can select them at pleasure, a freedom which is\nprohibited by nature in the original of the symbol. Persons who make use\nof this symbol in the dream are very extravagant with cravats, and\npossess regular collections of them.[CV] All complicated machines and\napparatus in dream are very probably genitals, in the description of\nwhich dream symbolism shows itself to be as tireless as the activity of\nwit. Likewise many landscapes in dreams, especially with bridges or with\nwooded mountains, can be readily recognised as descriptions of the\ngenitals. Finally where one finds incomprehensible neologisms one may\nthink of combinations made up of components having a sexual\nsignificance. Children also in the dream often signify the genitals, as\nmen and women are in the habit of fondly referring to their genital\norgan as their \u201clittle one.\u201d As a very recent symbol of the male genital\nmay be mentioned the flying machine, utilisation of which is justified\nby its relation to flying as well as occasionally by its form. To play\nwith a little child or to beat a little one is often the dream\u2019s\nrepresentation of onanism. A number of other symbols, in part not\nsufficiently verified, are given by Stekel,[114] who illustrates them\nwith examples. Right and left, according to him, are to be conceived in\nthe dream in an ethical sense. \u201cThe right way always signifies the road\nto righteousness, the left the one to crime. Thus the left may signify\nhomosexuality, incest, and perversion, while the right signifies\nmarriage, relations with a prostitute, &c. The meaning is always\ndetermined by the individual moral viewpoint of the dreamer\u201d (_l.c._, p.\n466). Relatives in the dream generally play the r\u00f4le of genitals (p.\n473). Not to be able to catch up with a wagon is interpreted by Stekel\nas regret not to be able to come up to a difference in age (p. 479).\nBaggage with which one travels is the burden of sin by which one is\noppressed (_ibid._). Also numbers, which frequently occur in the dream,\nare assigned by Stekel a fixed symbolical meaning, but these\ninterpretations seem neither sufficiently verified nor of general\nvalidity, although the interpretation in individual cases can generally\nbe recognised as probable. In a recently published book by W. Stekel,\n_Die Sprache des Traumes_, which I was unable to utilise, there is a\nlist (p. 72) of the most common sexual symbols, the object of which is\nto prove that all sexual symbols can be bisexually used. He states: \u201cIs\nthere a symbol which (if in any way permitted by the phantasy) may not\nbe used simultaneously in the masculine and the feminine sense!\u201d To be\nsure the clause in parentheses takes away much of the absoluteness of\nthis assertion, for this is not at all permitted by the phantasy. I do\nnot, however, think it superfluous to state that in my experience\nStekel\u2019s general statement has to give way to the recognition of a\ngreater manifoldness. Besides those symbols, which are just as frequent\nfor the male as for the female genitals, there are others which\npreponderately, or almost exclusively, designate one of the sexes, and\nthere are still others of which only the male or only the female\nsignification is known. To use long, firm objects and weapons as symbols\nof the female genitals, or hollow objects (chests, boxes, pouches, &c.),\nas symbols of the male genitals, is indeed not allowed by the fancy.\nIt is true that the tendency of the dream and the unconscious fancy to\nutilise the sexual symbol bisexually betrays an archaic trend, for in\nchildhood a difference in the genitals is unknown, and the same genitals\nare attributed to both sexes.\nThese very incomplete suggestions may suffice to stimulate others to\nmake a more careful collection.[CW]\nI shall now add a few examples of the application of such symbolisms in\ndreams, which will serve to show how impossible it becomes to interpret\na dream without taking into account the symbolism of dreams, and how\nimperatively it obtrudes itself in many cases.\n1. The hat as a symbol of the man (of the male genital):[CX] (a fragment\nfrom the dream of a young woman who suffered from agoraphobia on account\nof a fear of temptation).\n\u201cI am walking in the street in summer, I wear a straw hat of peculiar\nshape, the middle piece of which is bent upwards and the side pieces of\nwhich hang downwards (the description became here obstructed), and in\nsuch a fashion that one is lower than the other. I am cheerful and in a\nconfidential mood, and as I pass a troop of young officers I think to\nmyself: None of you can have any designs upon me.\u201d\nAs she could produce no associations to the hat, I said to her: \u201cThe hat\nis really a male genital, with its raised middle piece and the two\ndownward hanging side pieces.\u201d I intentionally refrained from\ninterpreting those details concerning the unequal downward hanging of\nthe two side pieces, although just such individualities in the\ndeterminations lead the way to the interpretation. I continued by saying\nthat if she only had a man with such a virile genital she would not have\nto fear the officers\u2014that is, she would have nothing to wish from them,\nfor she is mainly kept from going without protection and company by her\nfancies of temptation. This last explanation of her fear I had already\nbeen able to give her repeatedly on the basis of other material.\nIt is quite remarkable how the dreamer behaved after this\ninterpretation. She withdrew her description of the hat, and claimed not\nto have said that the two side pieces were hanging downwards. I was,\nhowever, too sure of what I had heard to allow myself to be misled, and\nI persisted in it. She was quiet for a while, and then found the courage\nto ask why it was that one of her husband\u2019s testicles was lower than the\nother, and whether it was the same in all men. With this the peculiar\ndetail of the hat was explained, and the whole interpretation was\naccepted by her. The hat symbol was familiar to me long before the\npatient related this dream. From other but less transparent cases I\nbelieve that the hat may also be taken as a female genital.\n2. The little one as the genital\u2014to be run over as a symbol of sexual\nintercourse (another dream of the same agoraphobic patient).\n\u201cHer mother sends away her little daughter so that she must go alone.\nShe rides with her mother to the railroad and sees her little one\nwalking directly upon the tracks, so that she cannot avoid being run\nover. She hears the bones crackle. (From this she experiences a feeling\nof discomfort but no real horror.) She then looks out through the car\nwindow to see whether the parts cannot be seen behind. She then\nreproaches her mother for allowing the little one to go out alone.\u201d\nAnalysis. It is not an easy matter to give here a complete\ninterpretation of the dream. It forms part of a cycle of dreams, and can\nbe fully understood only in connection with the others. For it is not\neasy to get the necessary material sufficiently isolated to prove the\nsymbolism. The patient at first finds that the railroad journey is to be\ninterpreted historically as an allusion to a departure from a sanatorium\nfor nervous diseases, with the superintendent of which she naturally was\nin love. Her mother took her away from this place, and the physician\ncame to the railroad station and handed her a bouquet of flowers on\nleaving; she felt uncomfortable because her mother witnessed this\nhomage. Here the mother, therefore, appears as a disturber of her love\naffairs, which is the r\u00f4le actually played by this strict woman during\nher daughter\u2019s girlhood. The next thought referred to the sentence: \u201cShe\nthen looks to see whether the parts can be seen behind.\u201d In the dream\nfa\u00e7ade one would naturally be compelled to think of the parts of the\nlittle daughter run over and ground up. The thought, however, turns in\nquite a different direction. She recalls that she once saw her father in\nthe bath-room naked from behind; she then begins to talk about the sex\ndifferentiation, and asserts that in the man the genitals can be seen\nfrom behind, but in the woman they cannot. In this connection she now\nherself offers the interpretation that the little one is the genital,\nher little one (she has a four-year-old daughter) her own genital. She\nreproaches her mother for wanting her to live as though she had no\ngenital, and recognises this reproach in the introductory sentence of\nthe dream; the mother sends away her little one so that she must go\nalone. In her phantasy going alone on the street signifies to have no\nman and no sexual relations (coire = to go together), and this she does\nnot like. According to all her statements she really suffered as a girl\non account of the jealousy of her mother, because she showed a\npreference for her father.\nThe \u201clittle one\u201d has been noted[CY] as a symbol for the male or the\nfemale genitals by Stekel, who can refer in this connection to a very\nwidespread usage of language.\nThe deeper interpretation of this dream depends upon another dream of\nthe same night in which the dreamer identifies herself with her brother.\nShe was a \u201ctomboy,\u201d and was always being told that she should have been\nborn a boy. This identification with the brother shows with special\nclearness that \u201cthe little one\u201d signifies the genital. The mother\nthreatened him (her) with castration, which could only be understood as\na punishment for playing with the parts, and the identification,\ntherefore, shows that she herself had masturbated as a child, though\nthis fact she now retained only in a memory concerning her brother. An\nearly knowledge of the male genital which she later lost she must have\nacquired at that time according to the assertions of this second dream.\nMoreover the second dream points to the infantile sexual theory that\ngirls originate from boys through castration. After I had told her of\nthis childish belief, she at once confirmed it with an anecdote in which\nthe boy asks the girl: \u201cWas it cut off?\u201d to which the girl replied, \u201cNo,\nit\u2019s always been so.\u201d\nThe sending away of the little one, of the genital, in the first dream\ntherefore also refers to the threatened castration. Finally she blames\nher mother for not having been born a boy.\nThat \u201cbeing run over\u201d symbolises sexual intercourse would not be evident\nfrom this dream if we were not sure of it from many other sources.\n3. Representation of the genital by structures, stairways, and shafts.\n(Dream of a young man inhibited by a father complex.)\n\u201cHe is taking a walk with his father in a place which is surely the\nPrater, for the _Rotunda_ may be seen in front of which there is a small\nfront structure to which is attached a captive balloon; the balloon,\nhowever, seems quite collapsed. His father asks him what this is all\nfor; he is surprised at it, but he explains it to his father. They come\ninto a court in which lies a large sheet of tin. His father wants to\npull off a big piece of this, but first looks around to see if anyone is\nwatching. He tells his father that all he needs to do is to speak to the\nwatchman, and then he can take without any further difficulty as much as\nhe wants to. From this court a stairway leads down into a shaft, the\nwalls of which are softly upholstered something like a leather\npocket-book. At the end of this shaft there is a longer platform, and\nthen a new shaft begins....\u201d\nAnalysis. This dream belongs to a type of patient which is not\nfavourable from a therapeutic point of view. They follow in the analysis\nwithout offering any resistances whatever up to a certain point, but\nfrom that point on they remain almost inaccessible. This dream he almost\nanalysed himself. \u201cThe Rotunda,\u201d he said, \u201cis my genital, the captive\nballoon in front is my penis, about the weakness of which I have\nworried.\u201d We must, however, interpret in greater detail; the Rotunda is\nthe buttock which is regularly associated by the child with the genital,\nthe smaller front structure is the scrotum. In the dream his father asks\nhim what this is all for\u2014that is, he asks him about the purpose and\narrangement of the genitals. It is quite evident that this state of\naffairs should be turned around, and that he should be the questioner.\nAs such a questioning on the side of the father has never taken place in\nreality, we must conceive the dream thought as a wish, or take it\nconditionally, as follows: \u201cIf I had only asked my father for sexual\nenlightenment.\u201d The continuation of this thought we shall soon find in\nanother place.\nThe court in which the tin sheet is spread out is not to be conceived\nsymbolically in the first instance, but originates from his father\u2019s\nplace of business. For discretionary reasons I have inserted the tin for\nanother material in which the father deals, without, however, changing\nanything in the verbal expression of the dream. The dreamer had entered\nhis father\u2019s business, and had taken a terrible dislike to the\nquestionable practices upon which profit mainly depends. Hence the\ncontinuation of the above dream thought (\u201cif I had only asked him\u201d)\nwould be: \u201cHe would have deceived me just as he does his customers.\u201d For\nthe pulling off, which serves to represent commercial dishonesty, the\ndreamer himself gives a second explanation\u2014namely, onanism. This is not\nonly entirely familiar to us (see above, p. 234), but agrees very well\nwith the fact that the secrecy of onanism is expressed by its opposite\n(\u201cWhy one can do it quite openly\u201d). It, moreover, agrees entirely with\nour expectations that the onanistic activity is again put off on the\nfather, just as was the questioning in the first scene of the dream. The\nshaft he at once interprets as the vagina by referring to the soft\nupholstering of the walls. That the act of coition in the vagina is\ndescribed as a going down instead of in the usual way as a going up, I\nhave also found true in other instances.[CZ]\nThe details that at the end of the first shaft there is a longer\nplatform and then a new shaft, he himself explains biographically. He\nhad for some time consorted with women sexually, but had then given it\nup because of inhibitions and now hopes to be able to take it up again\nwith the aid of the treatment. The dream, however, becomes indistinct\ntoward the end, and to the experienced interpreter it becomes evident\nthat in the second scene of the dream the influence of another subject\nhas begun to assert itself; in this his father\u2019s business and his\ndishonest practices signify the first vagina represented as a shaft so\nthat one might think of a reference to the mother.\n4. The male genital symbolised by persons and the female by a landscape.\n(Dream of a woman of the lower class, whose husband is a policeman,\nreported by B. Dattner.)\n... Then someone broke into the house and anxiously called for a\npoliceman. But he went with two tramps by mutual consent into a\nchurch,[DA] to which led a great many stairs;[DB] behind the church\nthere was a mountain,[DC] on top of which a dense forest.[DD] The\npoliceman was furnished with a helmet, a gorget, and a cloak.[DE] The\ntwo vagrants, who went along with the policeman quite peaceably, had\ntied to their loins sack-like aprons.[DF] A road led from the church to\nthe mountain. This road was overgrown on each side with grass and\nbrushwood, which became thicker and thicker as it reached the height of\nthe mountain, where it spread out into quite a forest.\n5. A stairway dream.\n(Reported and interpreted by Otto Rank.)\nFor the following transparent pollution dream, I am indebted to the same\ncolleague who furnished us with the dental-irritation dream reported on\np. 235.\n\u201cI am running down the stairway in the stair-house after a little girl,\nwhom I wish to punish because she has done something to me. At the\nbottom of the stairs some one held the child for me. (A grown-up woman?)\nI grasp it, but do not know whether I have hit it, for I suddenly find\nmyself in the middle of the stairway where I practise coitus with the\nchild (in the air as it were). It is really no coitus, I only rub my\ngenital on her external genital, and in doing this I see it very\ndistinctly, as distinctly as I see her head which is lying sideways.\nDuring the sexual act I see hanging to the left and above me (also as if\nin the air) two small pictures, landscapes, representing a house on a\ngreen. On the smaller one my surname stood in the place where the\npainter\u2019s signature should be; it seemed to be intended for my birthday\npresent. A small sign hung in front of the pictures to the effect that\ncheaper pictures could also be obtained. I then see myself very\nindistinctly lying in bed, just as I had seen myself at the foot of the\nstairs, and I am awakened by a feeling of dampness which came from the\npollution.\u201d\nInterpretation. The dreamer had been in a book-store on the evening of\nthe day of the dream, where, while he was waiting, he examined some\npictures which were exhibited, which represented motives similar to the\ndream pictures. He stepped nearer to a small picture which particularly\ntook his fancy in order to see the name of the artist, which, however,\nwas quite unknown to him.\nLater in the same evening, in company, he heard about a Bohemian\nservant-girl who boasted that her illegitimate child \u201cwas made on the\nstairs.\u201d The dreamer inquired about the details of this unusual\noccurrence, and learned that the servant-girl went with her lover to the\nhome of her parents, where there was no opportunity for sexual\nrelations, and that the excited man performed the act on the stairs. In\nwitty allusion to the mischievous expression used about wine-adulterers,\nthe dreamer remarked, \u201cThe child really grew on the cellar steps.\u201d\nThese experiences of the day, which are quite prominent in the dream\ncontent, were readily reproduced by the dreamer. But he just as readily\nreproduced an old fragment of infantile recollection which was also\nutilised by the dream. The stair-house was the house in which he had\nspent the greatest part of his childhood, and in which he had first\nbecome acquainted with sexual problems. In this house he used, among\nother things, to slide down the banister astride which caused him to\nbecome sexually excited. In the dream he also comes down the stairs very\nrapidly\u2014so rapidly that, according to his own distinct assertions, he\nhardly touched the individual stairs, but rather \u201cflew\u201d or \u201cslid down,\u201d\nas we used to say. Upon reference to this infantile experience, the\nbeginning of the dream seems to represent the factor of sexual\nexcitement. In the same house and in the adjacent residence the dreamer\nused to play pugnacious games with the neighbouring children, in which\nhe satisfied himself just as he did in the dream.\nIf one recalls from Freud\u2019s investigation of sexual symbolism[DG] that\nin the dream stairs or climbing stairs almost regularly symbolises\ncoitus, the dream becomes clear. Its motive power as well as its effect,\nas is shown by the pollution, is of a purely libidinous nature. Sexual\nexcitement became aroused during the sleeping state (in the dream this\nis represented by the rapid running or sliding down the stairs) and the\nsadistic thread in this is, on the basis of the pugnacious playing,\nindicated in the pursuing and overcoming of the child. The libidinous\nexcitement becomes enhanced and urges to sexual action (represented in\nthe dream by the grasping of the child and the conveyance of it to the\nmiddle of the stairway). Up to this point the dream would be one of pure\nsexual symbolism, and obscure for the unpractised dream interpreter. But\nthis symbolic gratification, which would have insured undisturbed sleep,\nwas not sufficient for the powerful libidinous excitement. The\nexcitement leads to an orgasm, and thus the whole stairway symbolism is\nunmasked as a substitute for coitus. Freud lays stress on the rhythmical\ncharacter of both actions as one of the reasons for the sexual\nutilisation of the stairway symbolism, and this dream especially seems\nto corroborate this, for, according to the express assertion of the\ndreamer, the rhythm of a sexual act was the most pronounced feature in\nthe whole dream.\nStill another remark concerning the two pictures, which, aside from\ntheir real significance, also have the value of \u201cWeibsbilder\u201d (literally\n_woman-pictures_, but idiomatically _women_). This is at once shown by\nthe fact that the dream deals with a big and a little picture, just as\nthe dream content presents a big (grown up) and a little girl. That\ncheap pictures could also be obtained points to the prostitution\ncomplex, just as the dreamer\u2019s surname on the little picture and the\nthought that it was intended for his birthday, point to the parent\ncomplex (to be born on the stairway\u2014to be conceived in coitus).\nThe indistinct final scene, in which the dreamer sees himself on the\nstaircase landing lying in bed and feeling wet, seems to go back into\nchildhood even beyond the infantile onanism, and manifestly has its\nprototype in similarly pleasurable scenes of bed-wetting.\n6. A modified stair-dream.\nTo one of my very nervous patients, who was an abstainer, whose fancy\nwas fixed on his mother, and who repeatedly dreamed of climbing stairs\naccompanied by his mother, I once remarked that moderate masturbation\nwould be less harmful to him than enforced abstinence. This influence\nprovoked the following dream:\n\u201cHis piano teacher reproaches him for neglecting his piano-playing, and\nfor not practising the _\u00c9tudes_ of Moscheles and Clementi\u2019s _Gradus ad\nParnassum_.\u201d In relation to this he remarked that the _Gradus_ is only a\nstairway, and that the piano itself is only a stairway as it has a\nscale.\nIt is correct to say that there is no series of associations which\ncannot be adapted to the representation of sexual facts. I conclude with\nthe dream of a chemist, a young man, who has been trying to give up his\nhabit of masturbation by replacing it with intercourse with women.\n_Preliminary statement._\u2014On the day before the dream he had given a\nstudent instruction concerning Grignard\u2019s reaction, in which magnesium\nis to be dissolved in absolutely pure ether under the catalytic\ninfluence of iodine. Two days before, there had been an explosion in the\ncourse of the same reaction, in which the investigator had burned his\nhand.\nDream I. _He is to make phenylmagnesiumbromid; he sees the apparatus\nwith particular clearness, but he has substituted himself for the\nmagnesium. He is now in a curious swaying attitude. He keeps repeating\nto himself, \u201cThis is the right thing, it is working, my feet are\nbeginning to dissolve and my knees are getting soft.\u201d Then he reaches\ndown and feels for his feet, and meanwhile (he does not know how) he\ntakes his legs out of the crucible, and then again he says to himself,\n\u201cThat cannot be.... Yes, it must be so, it has been done correctly.\u201d\nThen he partially awakens, and repeats the dream to himself, because he\nwants to tell it to me. He is distinctly afraid of the analysis of the\ndream. He is much excited during this semi-sleeping state, and repeats\ncontinually, \u201cPhenyl, phenyl.\u201d_\nII. _He is in ... ing with his whole family; at half-past eleven. He is\nto be at the Schottenthor for a rendezvous with a certain lady, but he\ndoes not wake up until half-past eleven. He says to himself, \u201cIt is too\nlate now; when you get there it will be half-past twelve.\u201d The next\ninstant he sees the whole family gathered about the table\u2014his mother and\nthe servant girl with the soup-tureen with particular clearness. Then he\nsays to himself, \u201cWell, if we are eating already, I certainly can\u2019t get\naway.\u201d_\nAnalysis: He feels sure that even the first dream contains a reference\nto the lady whom he is to meet at the rendezvous (the dream was dreamed\nduring the night before the expected meeting). The student to whom he\ngave the instruction is a particularly unpleasant fellow; he had said to\nthe chemist: \u201cThat isn\u2019t right,\u201d because the magnesium was still\nunaffected, and the latter answered as though he did not care anything\nabout it: \u201cIt certainly isn\u2019t right.\u201d He himself must be this student;\nhe is as indifferent towards his analysis as the student is towards his\nsynthesis; the _He_ in the dream, however, who accomplishes the\noperation, is myself. How unpleasant he must seem to me with his\nindifference towards the success achieved!\nMoreover, he is the material with which the analysis (synthesis) is\nmade. For it is a question of the success of the treatment. The legs in\nthe dream recall an impression of the previous evening. He met a lady at\na dancing lesson whom he wished to conquer; he pressed her to him so\nclosely that she once cried out. After he had stopped pressing against\nher legs, he felt her firm responding pressure against his lower thighs\nas far as just above his knees, at the place mentioned in the dream. In\nthis situation, then, the woman is the magnesium in the retort, which is\nat last working. He is feminine towards me, as he is masculine towards\nthe woman. If it will work with the woman, the treatment will also work.\nFeeling and becoming aware of himself in the region of his knees refers\nto masturbation, and corresponds to his fatigue of the previous day....\nThe rendezvous had actually been set for half-past eleven. His wish to\nover-sleep and to remain with his usual sexual objects (that is, with\nmasturbation) corresponds with his resistance.\nIn relation to the repetition of the name phenyl, he gives the following\nthoughts: All these radicals ending in _yl_ have always been pleasing to\nhim; they are very convenient to use: benzyl, azetyl, &c. That, however,\nexplained nothing. But when I proposed the radical Schlemihl[DH] he\nlaughed heartily, and related that during the summer he had read a book\nby Pr\u00e9vost which contained a chapter: \u201cLes exclus de l\u2019amour,\u201d the\ndescription in which made him think of the Schlemihls, and he added,\n\u201cThat is my case.\u201d He would have again acted the Schlemihl if he had\nmissed the rendezvous.\nVI\nTHE DREAM-WORK\nAll previous attempts to solve the problems of the dream have been based\ndirectly upon the manifest dream content as it is retained in the\nmemory, and have undertaken to obtain an interpretation of the dream\nfrom this content, or, if interpretation was dispensed with, to base a\njudgment of the dream upon the evidence furnished by this content. We\nalone are in possession of new data; for us a new psychic material\nintervenes between the dream content and the results of our\ninvestigations: and this is the _latent_ dream content or the dream\nthoughts which are obtained by our method. We develop a solution of the\ndream from this latter, and not from the manifest dream content. We are\nalso confronted for the first time with a problem which has not before\nexisted, that of examining and tracing the relations between the latent\ndream thoughts and the manifest dream content, and the processes through\nwhich the former have grown into the latter.\nWe regard the dream thoughts and the dream content as two\nrepresentations of the same meaning in two different languages; or to\nexpress it better, the dream content appears to us as a translation of\nthe dream thoughts into another form of expression, whose signs and laws\nof composition we are to learn by comparing the original with the\ntranslation. The dream thoughts are at once intelligible to us as soon\nas we have ascertained them. The dream content is, as it were, presented\nin a picture-writing, whose signs are to be translated one by one into\nthe language of the dream thoughts. It would of course be incorrect to\ntry to read these signs according to their values as pictures instead of\naccording to their significance as signs. For instance, I have before me\na picture-puzzle (rebus): a house, upon whose roof there is a boat; then\na running figure whose head has been apostrophised away, and the like. I\nmight now be tempted as a critic to consider this composition and its\nelements nonsensical. A boat does not belong on the roof of a house and\na person without a head cannot run; the person, too, is larger than the\nhouse, and if the whole thing is to represent a landscape, the single\nletters of the alphabet do not fit into it, for of course they do not\noccur in pure nature. A correct judgment of the picture-puzzle results\nonly if I make no such objections to the whole and its parts, but if, on\nthe contrary, I take pains to replace each picture by the syllable or\nword which it is capable of representing by means of any sort of\nreference, the words which are thus brought together are no longer\nmeaningless, but may constitute a most beautiful and sensible\nexpression. Now the dream is a picture-puzzle of this sort, and our\npredecessors in the field of dream interpretation have made the mistake\nof judging the rebus as an artistic composition. As such it appears\nnonsensical and worthless.\n(_a_) _The Condensation Work_\nThe first thing which becomes clear to the investigator in the\ncomparison of the dream content with the dream thoughts is that a\ntremendous work of condensation has taken place. The dream is reserved,\npaltry, and laconic when compared with the range and copiousness of the\ndream thoughts. The dream when written down fills half a page; the\nanalysis, in which the dream thoughts are contained, requires six,\neight, twelve times as much space. The ratio varies with different\ndreams; it never changes its essential meaning, as far as I have been\nable to observe. As a rule the extent of the compression which has taken\nplace is under-estimated, owing to the fact that the dream thoughts\nwhich are brought to light are considered the complete material, while\ncontinued work of interpretation may reveal new thoughts which are\nconcealed behind the dream. We have already mentioned that one is really\nnever sure of having interpreted a dream completely; even if the\nsolution seems satisfying and flawless, it still always remains possible\nthat there is a further meaning which is manifested by the same dream.\nThus the _amount of condensation_ is\u2014strictly speaking\u2014indeterminable.\nAn objection, which at first sight seems very plausible, might be raised\nagainst the assertion that the disproportion between dream content and\ndream thought justifies the conclusion that an abundant condensation of\npsychic material has taken place in the formation of dreams. For we so\noften have the impression that we have dreamed a great deal throughout\nthe night and then have forgotten the greater part. The dream which we\nrecollect upon awakening would thus be only a remnant of the total\ndream-work, which would probably equal the dream thoughts in range if we\nwere able to remember the former completely. In part this is certainly\ntrue; there can be no mistake about the observation that the dream is\nmost accurately reproduced if one tries to remember it immediately after\nawakening, and that the recollection of it becomes more and more\ndefective towards evening. On the other hand, it must be admitted that\nthe impression that we have dreamed a good deal more than we are able to\nreproduce is often based upon an illusion, the cause of which will be\nexplained later. Moreover, the assumption of condensation in the dream\nactivity is not affected by the possibility of forgetting in dreams, for\nit is proved by groups of ideas belonging to those particular parts of\nthe dream which have remained in the memory. If a large part of the\ndream has actually been lost to memory, we are probably deprived of\naccess to a new series of dream thoughts. It is altogether unjustifiable\nto expect that those portions of the dream which have been lost also\nrelate to the thoughts with which we are already acquainted from the\nanalysis of the portions which have been preserved.\nIn view of the great number of ideas which analysis furnishes for each\nindividual element of the dream content, the chief doubt with many\nreaders will be whether it is permissible to count everything that\nsubsequently comes to mind during analysis as a part of the dream\nthoughts\u2014to assume, in other words, that all these thoughts have been\nactive in the sleeping state and have taken part in the formation of the\ndream. Is it not more probable that thought connections are developed in\nthe course of analysis which did not participate in the formation of the\ndream? I can meet this doubt only conditionally. It is true, of course,\nthat particular thought connections first arise only during analysis;\nbut one may always be sure that such new connections have been\nestablished only between thoughts which have already been connected in\nthe dream thoughts by other means; the new connections are, so to speak,\ncorollaries, short circuits, which are made possible by the existence of\nother more fundamental means of connection. It must be admitted that the\nhuge number of trains of thought revealed by analysis have already been\nactive in the formation of the dream, for if a chain of thoughts has\nbeen worked out, which seems to be without connection with the formation\nof the dream, a thought is suddenly encountered which, being represented\nin the dream, is indispensable to its interpretation\u2014which nevertheless\nis inaccessible except through that chain of thoughts. The reader may\nhere turn to the dream of the botanical monograph, which is obviously\nthe result of an astonishing condensation activity, even though I have\nnot given the analysis of it completely.\nBut how, then, is the psychic condition during sleep which precedes\ndreaming to be imagined? Do all the dream thoughts exist side by side,\nor do they occur one after another, or are many simultaneous trains of\nthought constructed from different centres, which meet later on? I am of\nthe opinion that it is not yet necessary to form a plastic conception of\nthe psychic condition of dream formation. Only let us not forget that we\nare concerned with unconscious thought, and that the process may easily\nbe a different one from that which we perceive in ourselves in\nintentional contemplation accompanied by consciousness.\nThe fact, however, that dream formation is based on a process of\ncondensation, stands indubitable. How, then, is this condensation\nbrought about?\nIf it be considered that of those dream thoughts which are found only\nthe smallest number are represented in the dream by means of one of its\nideal elements, it might be concluded that condensation is accomplished\nby means of ellipsis, in that the dream is not an accurate translation\nor a projection point by point of the dream thoughts, but a very\nincomplete and defective reproduction of them. This view, as we shall\nsoon find, is a very inadequate one. But let us take it as a starting\npoint for the present, and ask ourselves: If only a few of the elements\nof the dream thoughts get into the dream content, what conditions\ndetermine their choice?\nIn order to gain enlightenment on this subject let us turn our attention\nto those elements of the dream content which must have fulfilled the\nconditions we are seeking. A dream to the formation of which an\nespecially strong condensation has contributed will be the most suitable\nmaterial for this investigation. I select the dream, cited on page 142,\nof the botanical monograph.\nDream content: _I have written a monograph upon a (obscure) certain\nplant. The book lies before me, I am just turning over a folded coloured\nplate. A dried specimen of the plant is bound with every copy as though\nfrom a herbarium._\nThe most prominent element of this dream is the botanical monograph.\nThis comes from the impressions received on the day of the dream; I had\nactually _seen a monograph on the genus \u201ccyclamen\u201d_ in the show-window\nof a book-store. The mention of this genus is lacking in the dream\ncontent, in which only the monograph and its relation to botany have\nremained. The \u201cbotanical monograph\u201d immediately shows its relation to\nthe work on cocaine which I had once written; thought connections\nproceed from cocaine on the one hand to a \u201cFestschrift,\u201d and on the\nother to my friend, the eye specialist, Dr. Koenigstein, who has had a\nshare in the utilisation of cocaine. Moreover, with the person of this\nDr. Koenigstein is connected the recollection of the interrupted\nconversation which I had had with him on the previous evening and of the\nmanifold thoughts about remuneration for medical services among\ncolleagues. This conversation, then, is properly the actual stimulus of\nthe dream; the monograph about cyclamen is likewise an actuality but of\nan indifferent nature; as I soon see, the \u201cbotanical monograph\u201d of the\ndream turns out to be a common mean between the two experiences of the\nday, and to have been taken over unchanged from an indifferent\nimpression and bound up with the psychologically significant experience\nby means of the most abundant associations.\nNot only the combined idea, \u201cbotanical monograph,\u201d however, but also\neach of the separate elements, \u201cbotanical\u201d and \u201cmonograph,\u201d penetrates\ndeeper and deeper into the confused tangle of the dream thoughts. To\n\u201cbotanical\u201d belong the recollections of the person of Professor\n_Gartner_ (German: G\u00e4rtner = gardener), of his _blooming_ wife, of my\npatient whose name is _Flora_, and of a lady about whom I told the story\nof the forgotten _flowers_. _Gartner_, again, is connected with the\nlaboratory and the conversation with _Koenigstein_; the mention of the\ntwo female patients also belongs to the same conversation. A chain of\nthoughts, one end of which is formed by the title of the hastily seen\nmonograph, leads off in the other direction from the lady with the\nflowers to the _favourite flowers_ of my wife. Besides this, \u201cbotanical\u201d\nrecalls not only an episode at the Gymnasium, but an examination taken\nwhile I was at the university; and a new subject matter\u2014my hobbies\u2014which\nwas broached in the conversation already mentioned, is connected by\nmeans of my humorously so-called _favourite flower_, the artichoke, with\nthe chain of thoughts proceeding from the forgotten flowers; behind\n\u201cartichoke\u201d there is concealed on the one hand a recollection of Italy,\nand on the other a reminiscence of a childhood scene in which I first\nformed my connection with books which has since grown so intimate.\n\u201cBotanical,\u201d then, is a veritable nucleus, the centre for the dream of\nmany trains of thought, which, I may assure the reader, were correctly\nand justly brought into relation to one another in the conversation\nreferred to. Here we find ourselves in a thought factory, in which, as\nin the \u201cWeaver\u2019s Masterpiece\u201d:\n\u201cOne tread moves thousands of threads,\nThe little shuttles fly back and forth,\nThe threads flow on unseen,\nOne stroke ties thousands of knots.\u201d\n\u201c_Monograph_\u201d in the dream, again, has a bearing upon two subjects, the\none-sidedness of my studies and the costliness of my hobbies.\nThe impression is gained from this first investigation that the elements\n\u201cbotanical\u201d and \u201cmonograph\u201d have been accepted in the dream content\nbecause they were able to show the most extensive connections with the\ndream thoughts, and thus represent nuclei in which a great number of\ndream thoughts come together, and because they have manifold\nsignificance for the dream interpretation. The fact upon which this\nexplanation is based may be expressed in another form: Every element of\nthe dream content turns out to be _over-determined_\u2014that is, it enjoys a\nmanifold representation in the dream thoughts.\nWe shall learn more by testing the remaining component parts of the\ndream as to their occurrence in the dream thoughts. _The coloured plate_\nrefers (_cf._ the analysis on p. 145) to a new subject, the criticism\npassed upon my work by colleagues, and to a subject already represented\nin the dream\u2014my hobbies\u2014and also to a childish recollection in which I\npull to pieces the book with the coloured plates; the dried specimen of\nthe plant relates to an experience at the Gymnasium centering about and\nparticularly emphasizing the herbarium. Thus I see what sort of relation\nexists between the dream content and dream thoughts: Not only do the\nelements of the dream have a manifold determination in the dream\nthoughts, but the individual dream thoughts are represented in the dream\nby many elements. Starting from an element of the dream the path of\nassociations leads to a number of dream thoughts; and from a dream\nthought to several elements of the dream. The formation of the dream\ndoes not, therefore, take place in such fashion that a single one of the\ndream thoughts or a group of them furnishes the dream content with an\nabridgment as its representative therein, and that then another dream\nthought furnishes another abridgment as its representative\u2014somewhat as\npopular representatives are elected from among the people\u2014but the whole\nmass of the dream thoughts is subjected to a certain elaboration, in the\ncourse of which those elements that receive the greatest and completest\nsupport stand out in relief, analogous, perhaps, to election by\n_scrutins des listes_. Whatever dream I may subject to such\ndismemberment, I always find the same fundamental principle\nconfirmed\u2014that the dream elements are constructed from the entire mass\nof the dream thoughts and that every one of them appears in relation to\nthe dream thoughts to have a multiple determination.\nIt is certainly not out of place to demonstrate this relation of the\ndream content to the dream thoughts by means of a fresh example, which\nis distinguished by a particularly artful intertwining of reciprocal\nrelations. The dream is that of a patient whom I am treating for\nclaustrophobia (fear in enclosed spaces). It will soon become evident\nwhy I feel myself called upon to entitle this exceptionally intellectual\npiece of dream activity in the following manner:\nII. \u201c_A Beautiful Dream_\u201d\n_The dreamer is riding with much company to X-street, where there is a\nmodest road-house_ (which is not the fact). _A theatrical performance is\nbeing given in its rooms. He is first audience, then actor. Finally the\ncompany is told to change their clothes, in order to get back into the\ncity. Some of the people are assigned to the rooms on the ground floor,\nothers to the first floor. Then a dispute arises. Those above are angry\nbecause those below have not yet finished, so that they cannot come\ndown. His brother is upstairs, he is below, and he is angry at his\nbrother because there is such crowding._ (This part obscure.) _Besides\nit has already been decided upon their arrival who is to be upstairs and\nwho down. Then he goes alone over the rising ground, across which\nX-street leads toward the city, and he has such difficulty and hardship\nin walking that he cannot move from the spot. An elderly gentleman joins\nhim and scolds about the King of Italy. Finally, towards the end of the\nrising ground walking becomes much easier._\nThe difficulties experienced in walking were so distinct that for some\ntime after waking he was in doubt whether they were dream or reality.\nAccording to the manifest content, this dream can hardly be praised.\nContrary to the rules, I shall begin with that portion which the dreamer\nreferred to as the most distinct.\nThe difficulties which were dreamed of, and which were probably\nexperienced during the dream\u2014difficult climbing accompanied by\ndyspn\u0153a\u2014is one of the symptoms which the patient had actually shown\nyears before, and which, in conjunction with other symptoms, was at that\ntime attributed to tuberculosis (probably hysterically simulated). We\nare already from exhibition dreams acquainted with this sensation of\nbeing hindered, peculiar to the dream, and here again we find it used\nfor the purpose of any kind of representation, as an ever-ready\nmaterial. That part of the dream content which ascribes the climbing as\ndifficult at first, and as becoming easier at the end of the hill, made\nme think while it was being told of the well-known masterful\nintroduction to _Sappho_ by A. Daudet. Here a young man carries the girl\nwhom he loves upstairs\u2014she is at first as light as a feather; but the\nhigher he mounts the more heavily she weighs upon his arm, and this\nscene symbolises a course of events by recounting which Daudet tries to\nwarn young men not to waste serious affection upon girls of humble\norigin or of questionable past.[DI] Although I knew that my patient had\nrecently had a love affair with a lady of the theatre, and had broken it\noff, I did not expect to find that the interpretation which had occurred\nto me was correct. Moreover, the situation in _Sappho_ was the _reverse_\nof that in the dream; in the latter the climbing was difficult at the\nbeginning and easy later on; in the novel the symbolism serves only if\nwhat was at first regarded as easy finally turns out to be a heavy load.\nTo my astonishment, the patient remarked that the interpretation\ncorresponded closely to the plot of a play which he had seen on the\nevening before at the theatre. The play was called _Round about Vienna_,\nand treated of the career of a girl who is respectable at first but\nlater goes over to the _demi-monde_, who has affairs with persons in\nhigh places, thus \u201cclimbing,\u201d but finally \u201cgoes down\u201d faster and faster.\nThis play had reminded him of another entitled _From Step to Step_, in\nthe advertisement of which had appeared a _stairway_ consisting of\nseveral steps.\nNow to continue the interpretation. The actress with whom he had had his\nmost recent affair, a complicated one, had lived in X-street. There is\nno inn in this street. However, while he was spending a part of the\nsummer in Vienna for the sake of the lady, he had lodged (German\n_abgestiegen_ = stopped, literally _stepped off_) at a little hotel in\nthe neighbourhood. As he was leaving the hotel he said to the\ncab-driver, \u201cI am glad I didn\u2019t get any vermin anyway\u201d (which\nincidentally is one of his phobias). Whereupon the cab-driver answered:\n\u201cHow could anybody stop there! It isn\u2019t a hotel at all, it\u2019s really\nnothing but a _road-house_!\u201d\nThe road-house immediately suggests to the dreamer\u2019s recollection a\nquotation:\n\u201cOf that marvellous host\nI was once a guest.\u201d\nBut the host in the poem by Uhland is an apple tree. Now a second\nquotation continues the train of thought:\nFAUST (_dancing with the young witch_).\n\u201cA lovely dream once came to me;\nI then beheld an apple tree,\nAnd there two fairest apples shone:\nThey lured me so, I climbed thereon.\u201d\nTHE FAIR ONE.\n\u201cApples have been desired by you,\nSince first in Paradise they grew;\nAnd I am moved with joy to know\nThat such within my garden grow.\u201d\n_Translated by_ BAYARD TAYLOR.\nThere remains not the slightest doubt what is meant by the apple tree\nand the apples. A beautiful bosom stood high among the charms with which\nthe actress had bewitched our dreamer.\nAccording to the connections of the analysis we had every reason to\nassume that the dream went back to an impression from childhood. In this\ncase it must have reference to the nurse of the patient, who is now a\nman of nearly fifty years of age. The bosom of the nurse is in reality a\nroad-house for the child. The nurse as well as Daudet\u2019s Sappho appears\nas an allusion to his abandoned sweetheart.\nThe (elder) brother of the patient also appears in the dream content; he\nis upstairs, the dreamer himself is below. This again is an _inversion_,\nfor the brother, as I happen to know, has lost his social position, my\npatient has retained his. In reporting the dream content the dreamer\navoided saying that his brother was upstairs and that he himself was\n_down_. It would have been too frank an expression, for a person is said\nto be \u201cdown and out\u201d when he has lost his fortune and position. Now the\nfact that at this point in the dream something is represented as\ninverted must have a meaning. The inversion must apply rather to some\nother relation between the dream thoughts and dream content. There is an\nindication which suggests how this inversion is to be taken. It\nobviously applies to the end of the dream, where the circumstances of\nclimbing are the reverse of those in _Sappho_. Now it may easily be seen\nwhat inversion is referred to; in _Sappho_ the man carries the woman who\nstands in a sexual relation to him; in the dream thoughts, _inversely_,\na woman carries a man, and as this state of affairs can only occur\nduring childhood, the reference is again to the nurse who carries the\nheavy child. Thus the final portion of the dream succeeds in\nrepresenting _Sappho_ and the nurse in the same allusion.\nJust as the name _Sappho_ has not been selected by the poet without\nreference to a Lesbian custom, so the elements of the dream in which\npersons act _above_ and _below_, point to fancies of a sexual nature\nwith which the dreamer is occupied and which as suppressed cravings are\nnot without connection with his neurosis. Dream interpretation itself\ndoes not show that these are fancies and not recollections of actual\nhappenings; it only furnishes us with a set of thoughts and leaves us to\ndetermine their value as realities. Real and fantastic occurrences at\nfirst appear here as of equal value\u2014and not only here but also in the\ncreation of more important psychic structures than dreams. Much company,\nas we already know, signifies a secret. The brother is none other than a\nrepresentative, drawn into the childhood scene by \u201cfancying backwards,\u201d\nof all of the later rivals for the woman. Through the agency of an\nexperience which is indifferent in itself, the episode with the\ngentleman who scolds about the King of Italy again refers to the\nintrusion of people of low rank into aristocratic society. It is as\nthough the warning which Daudet gives to youth is to be supplemented by\na similar warning applicable to the suckling child.[DJ]\nIn order that we may have at our disposal a third example for the study\nof condensation in dream formation, I shall cite the partial analysis of\nanother dream for which I am indebted to an elderly lady who is being\npsychoanalytically treated. In harmony with the condition of severe\nanxiety from which the patient suffered, her dreams contained a great\nabundance of sexual thought material, the discovery of which astonished\nas well as frightened her. Since I cannot carry the interpretation of\nthe dream to completion, the material seems to fall apart into several\ngroups without apparent connection.\nIII. Content of the dream: _She remembers that she has two June bugs in\na box, which she must set at liberty, for otherwise they will suffocate.\nShe opens the box, and the bugs are quite exhausted; one of them flies\nout of the window, but the other is crushed on the casement while she is\nshutting the window, as some one or other requests her to do\n(expressions of disgust)._\nAnalysis: Her husband is away travelling, and her fourteen-year-old\ndaughter is sleeping in the bed next to her. In the evening the little\none calls her attention to the fact that a moth has fallen into her\nglass of water; but she neglects to take it out, and feels sorry for the\npoor little creature in the morning. A story which she had read in the\nevening told of boys throwing a cat into boiling water, and the\ntwitchings of the animal were described. These are the occasions for the\ndream, both of which are indifferent in themselves. She is further\noccupied with the subject of _cruelty to animals_. Years before, while\nthey were spending the summer at a certain place, her daughter was very\ncruel to animals. She started a butterfly collection, and asked her for\narsenic with which to kill the butterflies. Once it happened that a moth\nflew about the room for a long time with a needle through its body; on\nanother occasion she found that some moths which had been kept for\nmetamorphosis had died of starvation. The same child while still at a\ntender age was in the habit of pulling out the wings of beetles and\nbutterflies; now she would shrink in horror from these cruel actions,\nfor she has grown very kind.\nHer mind is occupied with this contrast. It recalls another contrast,\nthe one between appearance and disposition, as it is described in _Adam\nBede_ by George Eliot. There a beautiful but vain and quite stupid girl\nis placed side by side with an ugly but high-minded one. The aristocrat\nwho seduces the little goose, is opposed to the working man who feels\n_aristocratic_, and behaves accordingly. It is impossible to tell\ncharacter from people\u2019s _looks_. Who could tell from _her_ looks that\nshe is tormented by sensual desires?\nIn the same year in which the little girl started her butterfly\ncollection, the region in which they were staying suffered much from a\npest of June bugs. The children made havoc among the bugs, and _crushed_\nthem cruelly. At that time she saw a person who tore the wings off the\nJune bugs and ate them. She herself had been born in June and also\nmarried in June. Three days after the wedding she wrote a letter home,\ntelling how happy she was. But she was by no means happy.\nDuring the evening before the dream she had rummaged among her old\nletters and had read various ones, comical and serious, to her family\u2014an\nextremely ridiculous letter from a piano-teacher who had paid her\nattention when she was a girl, as well as one from an aristocratic\nadmirer.[DK]\nShe blames herself because a bad book by de Maupassant had fallen into\nthe hands of one of her daughters.[DL] The arsenic which her little girl\nasks for recalls the arsenic pills which restored the power of youth to\nthe Duc de Mora in _Nabab_.\n\u201cSet at liberty\u201d recalls to her a passage from the _Magic Flute_:\n\u201cI cannot compel you to love,\nBut I will not give you your liberty.\u201d\n\u201cJune bugs\u201d suggests the speech of Katie:[DM]\n\u201cI love you like a little beetle.\u201d\nMeanwhile the speech from _Tannhauser_: \u201cFor you are wrought with evil\npassion.\u201d\nShe is living in fear and anxiety about her absent husband. The dread\nthat something may happen to him on the journey is expressed in numerous\nfancies of the day. A little while before, during the analysis, she had\ncome upon a complaint about his \u201csenility\u201d in her unconscious thoughts.\nThe wish thought which this dream conceals may perhaps best be\nconjectured if I say that several days before the dream she was suddenly\nastounded by a command which she directed to her husband in the midst of\nher work: \u201c_Go hang yourself_.\u201d It was found that a few hours before she\nhad read somewhere that a vigorous erection is induced when a person is\nhanged. It was for the erection which freed itself from repression in\nthis terror-inspiring veiled form. \u201cGo hang yourself\u201d is as much as to\nsay: \u201cGet up an erection, at any cost.\u201d Dr. Jenkin\u2019s arsenic pills in\n_Nabab_ belong in this connection; for it was known to the patient that\nthe strongest aphrodisiac, cantharides, is prepared by _crushing bugs_\n(so-called Spanish flies). The most important part of the dream content\nhas a significance to this effect.\nOpening and shutting the _window_ is the subject of a standing quarrel\nwith her husband. She herself likes to sleep with plenty of air, and her\nhusband does not. _Exhaustion_ is the chief ailment of which she\ncomplains these days.\nIn all three of the dreams just cited I have emphasized by italics those\nphrases where one of the elements of the dream recurs in the dream\nthoughts in order to make the manifold references of the former obvious.\nSince, however, the analysis of none of these dreams has been carried to\ncompletion, it will be well worth while to consider a dream with a fully\ndetailed analysis, in order to demonstrate the manifold determination of\nits content. I select the dream of Irma\u2019s injection for this purpose. We\nshall see without effort in this example that the condensation work has\nused more than one means for the formation of the dream.\nThe chief person in the content of the dream is my patient Irma, who is\nseen with the features which belong to her in waking life, and who\ntherefore in the first instance represents herself. But her attitude as\nI examine her at the window is taken from the recollection of another\nperson, of the lady for whom I should like to exchange my patient, as\nthe dream thoughts show. In as far as Irma shows a diphtheritic membrane\nwhich recalls my anxiety about my eldest daughter, she comes to\nrepresent this child of mine, behind whom is concealed the person of the\npatient who died from intoxication and who is brought into connection by\nthe identity of her name. In the further course of the dream the\nsignificance of Irma\u2019s personality changes (without the alteration of\nher image as it is seen in the dream); she becomes one of the children\nwhom we examine in the public dispensaries for children\u2019s diseases,\nwhere my friends show the difference of their mental capabilities. The\ntransference was obviously brought about through the idea of my infant\ndaughter. By means of her unwillingness to open her mouth the same Irma\nis changed into an allusion to another lady who was once examined by me,\nand besides that to my wife, in the same connection. Furthermore, in the\nmorbid transformations which I discover in her throat I have gathered\nallusions to a great number of other persons.\nAll these people whom I encounter as I follow the associations suggested\nby \u201cIrma,\u201d do not appear personally in the dream; they are concealed\nbehind the dream person \u201cIrma,\u201d who is thus developed into a collective\nimage, as might be expected, with contradictory features. Irma comes to\nrepresent these other persons, who are discarded in the work of\ncondensation, in that I cause to happen to her all the things which\nrecall these persons detail for detail.\nI may also construct a collective person for the condensation of the\ndream in another manner, by uniting the actual features of two or more\npersons in one dream image. It is in this manner that Dr. M. in my dream\nwas constructed, he bears the name of Dr. M., and speaks and acts as Dr.\nM. does, but his bodily characteristics and his suffering belong to\nanother person, my eldest brother; a single feature, paleness, is doubly\ndetermined, owing to the fact that it is common to both persons. Dr. R.\nin my dream about my uncle is a similar composite person. But here the\ndream image is prepared in still another manner. I have not united\nfeatures peculiar to the one with features of the other, and thereby\nabridged the remembered image of each by certain features, but I have\nadopted the method employed by Galton in producing family portraits, by\nwhich he projects both pictures upon one another, whereupon the common\nfeatures stand out in stronger relief, while those which do not coincide\nneutralize one another and become obscure in the picture. In the dream\nof my uncle the _blond beard_ stands out in relief, as an emphasized\nfeature, from the physiognomy, which belongs to two persons, and which\nis therefore blurred; furthermore the beard contains an allusion to my\nfather and to myself, which is made possible by its reference to the\nfact of growing grey.\nThe construction of collective and composite persons is one of the chief\nresources of the activity of dream condensation. There will soon be an\noccasion for treating of this in another connection.\nThe notion \u201cdysentery\u201d in the dream about the injection likewise has a\nmanifold determination, on the one hand because of its paraphasic\nassonance with diphtheria, and on the other because of its reference to\nthe patient, whom I have sent to the Orient, and whose hysteria has been\nwrongly recognised.\nThe mention of \u201cpropyls\u201d in the dream also proves to be an interesting\ncase of condensation. Not \u201cpropyls\u201d but \u201camyls\u201d were contained in the\ndream thoughts. One might think that here a simple displacement had\noccurred in the dream formation. And this is the case, but the\ndisplacement serves the purposes of condensation, as is shown by the\nfollowing supplementary analysis. If I dwell for a moment upon the word\n\u201cpropyls,\u201d its assonance to the word \u201cpropyl\u00e6um\u201d suggests itself to me.\nBut the propyl\u00e6um is to be found not only in Athens but also in Munich.\nIn the latter city I visited a friend the year before who was seriously\nill, and the reference to him becomes unmistakable on account of\n_trimethylamin_, which follows closely upon _propyls_.\nI pass over the striking circumstance that here, as elsewhere in the\nanalysis of dreams, associations of the most widely different values are\nemployed for the establishment of thought connections as though they\nwere equivalent, and I yield to the temptation to regard the process by\nwhich _amyls_ in the dream thoughts are replaced by _propyls_, as though\nit were plastic in the dream content.\nOn the one hand is the chain of ideas about my friend Otto, who does not\nunderstand me, who thinks I am in the wrong, and who gives me the\ncordial that smells like amyls; on the other the chain of\nideas\u2014connected with the first by contrast\u2014about my friend William, who\nunderstands me and who would always think I was in the right, and to\nwhom I am indebted for so much valuable information about the chemistry\nof the sexual processes.\nThose characteristics of the associations centering about Otto which\nought particularly to attract my attention are determined by the recent\noccasions which are responsible for the dream; _amyls_ belong to these\nelements so determined which are destined to get into the dream content.\nThe group of associations \u201cWilliam\u201d is distinctly vivified by the\ncontrast to Otto, and the elements in it which correspond to those\nalready excited in the \u201cOtto\u201d associations are thrown into relief. In\nthis whole dream I am continually referring to a person who excites my\ndispleasure and to another person whom I can oppose to him or her at\nwill, and I conjure up the friend as against the enemy, feature for\nfeature. Thus amyls in the Otto-group suggests recollections in the\nother group belonging to chemistry; trimethylamin, which receives\nsupport from several quarters, finds its way into the dream content.\n\u201cAmyls,\u201d too, might have got into the dream content without undergoing\nchange, but it yields to the influence of the \u201cWilliam\u201d group of\nassociations, owing to the fact that an element which is capable of\nfurnishing a double determination for amyls is sought out from the whole\nrange of recollections which the name \u201cWilliam\u201d covers. The association\n\u201cpropyls\u201d lies in the neighbourhood of _amyls_; Munich with the\npropyl\u00e6um comes to meet _amyls_ from the series of associations\nbelonging to \u201cWilliam.\u201d Both groups are united in _propyls\u2014propyl\u0153um_.\nAs though by a compromise, this intermediary element gets into the dream\ncontent. Here a _common mean_ which permits of a manifold determination\nhas been created. It thus becomes perfectly obvious that manifold\ndetermination must facilitate penetration into the dream content. A\ndisplacement of attention from what is really intended to something\nlying near in the associations has thoughtlessly taken place, for the\nsake of this mean-formation.\nThe study of the injection dream has now enabled us to get some insight\ninto the process of condensation which takes place in the formation of\ndreams. The selection of those elements which occur in the dream content\nmore than once, the formation of new unities (collective persons,\ncomposite images), and the construction of the common mean, these we\nhave been able to recognise as details of the condensing process. The\npurpose which is served by condensation and the means by which it is\nbrought about will be investigated when we come to study the psychic\nprocesses in the formation of dreams as a whole. Let us be content for\nthe present with establishing dream _condensation_ as an important\nrelation between the dream thoughts and the dream content.\nThe condensing activity of the dream becomes most tangible when it has\nselected words and names as its object. In general words are often\ntreated as things by the dream, and thus undergo the same combinations,\ndisplacements, and substitutions, and therefore also condensations, as\nideas of things. The results of such dreams are comical and bizarre word\nformations. Upon one occasion when a colleague had sent me one of his\nessays, in which he had, in my judgment, overestimated the value of a\nrecent physiological discovery and had expressed himself in extravagant\nterms, I dreamed the following night a sentence which obviously referred\nto this treatise: \u201c_That is in true norekdal style_.\u201d The solution of\nthis word formation at first gave me difficulties, although it was\nunquestionably formed as a parody after the pattern of the superlatives\n\u201ccolossal,\u201d \u201cpyramidal\u201d; but to tell where it came from was not easy. At\nlast the monster fell apart into the two names Nora and Ekdal from two\nwell-known plays by Ibsen. I had previously read a newspaper essay on\nIbsen by the same author, whose latest work I was thus criticising in\nthe dream.\nII.[DN] One of my female patients dreams that _a man with a light beard\nand a peculiar glittering eye is pointing to a sign board attached to a\ntree which reads: uclamparia\u2014wet_.\nAnalysis. The man was rather authoritative looking, and his peculiar\nglittering eye at once recalled St. Paul\u2019s Cathedral, near Rome, where\nshe saw in mosaics the Popes that have so far ruled. One of the early\nPopes had a golden eye (this was really an optical illusion which the\nguides usually call attention to). Further associations showed that the\ngeneral physiognomy corresponded to her own clergyman (Pope), and the\nshape of the light beard recalled her doctor (myself), while the stature\nof the man in the dream recalled her father. All these persons stand in\nthe same relation to her; they are all guiding and directing her course\nof life. On further questioning, the golden eye recalled gold\u2014money\u2014the\nrather expensive psychoanalytic treatment which gives her a great deal\nof concern. Gold, moreover, recalls the gold cure for alcoholism\u2014Mr. D.,\nwhom she would have married if it had not been for his clinging to the\ndisgusting alcohol habit\u2014she does not object to a person taking an\noccasional drink; she herself sometimes drinks beer and cordials\u2014this\nagain brings her back to her visit to St. Paul\u2019s without the walls and\nits surroundings. She remembers that in the neighbouring monastery of\nthe Three Fountains she drank a liquor made of eucalyptus by the\nTrappist monks who inhabit this monastery. She then relates how the\nmonks transformed this malarial and swampy region into a dry and\nhealthful neighbourhood by planting there many eucalyptus trees. The\nword \u201cuclamparia\u201d then resolves itself into eucalyptus and malaria, and\nthe word \u201cwet\u201d refers to the former swampy nature of the place. Wet also\nsuggests dry. Dry is actually the name of the man whom she would have\nmarried except for his over-indulgence in alcohol. The peculiar name of\nDry is of Germanic origin (drei = three) and hence alludes to the Abbey\nof the Three (drei) Fountains above mentioned. In talking about Mr.\nDry\u2019s habit she used the strong words, \u201cHe could drink a fountain.\u201d Mr.\nDry jocosely refers to his habit by saying, \u201cYou know I must drink\nbecause I am always _dry_\u201d (referring to his name). The eucalyptus also\nrefers to her neurosis, which was at first diagnosed as malaria. She\nwent to Italy because her attacks of anxiety, which were accompanied by\nmarked trembling and shivering, were thought to be of malarial origin.\nShe bought some eucalyptus oil from the monks, and she maintains that it\nhas done her much good.\nThe condensation _uclamparia\u2014wet_ is therefore the point of junction for\nthe dream as well as for the neurosis.[DO]\nIII. In a somewhat long and wild dream of my own, the chief point of\nwhich is apparently a sea voyage, it happens that the next landing is\ncalled _Hearsing_ and the one farther on _Fliess_. The latter is the\nname of my friend living in B., who has often been the objective point\nof my travels. But Hearsing is put together from the names of places in\nthe local environment of Vienna, which so often end in _ing_:\n_Hietzing_, _Liesing_, _Moedling_ (Medelitz, \u201cme\u00e6 delici\u00e6,\u201d my own name,\n\u201c_my joy_\u201d) (joy = German Freude), and the English _hearsay_, which\npoints to libel and establishes the relation to the indifferent dream\nexcitement of the day\u2014a poem in the _Fliegende Blaetter_ about a\nslanderous dwarf, \u201cSaidhe Hashesaid.\u201d By connecting the final syllable\n\u201c_ing_\u201d with the name _Fliess_, \u201c_Vlissingen_\u201d is obtained, which is a\nreal port on the sea-voyage which my brother passes when he comes to\nvisit us from England. But the English for _Vlissingen_ is _Flushing_,\nwhich signifies blushing and recalls erythrophobia (fear of blushing),\nwhich I treat, and also reminds me of a recent publication by Bechterew\nabout this neurosis, which has given occasion for angry feelings in me.\nIV. Upon another occasion I had a dream which consisted of two parts.\nThe first was the vividly remembered word \u201cAutodidasker,\u201d the second was\ntruthfully covered by a short and harmless fancy which had been\ndeveloped a few days before, and which was to the effect that I must\ntell Professor N., when I saw him next: \u201cThe patient about whose\ncondition I last consulted you is really suffering from a neurosis, just\nas you suspected.\u201d The coinage \u201c_Autodidasker_\u201d must, then, not only\nsatisfy the requirement that it should contain or represent a compressed\nmeaning, but also that this meaning should have a valid connection with\nmy purpose, which is repeated from waking life, of giving Professor N.\nhis due credit.\nNow _Autodidasker_ is easily separated into _author_ (German _Autor_),\n_autodidact_, and _Lasker_, with whom is associated the name Lasalle.\nThe first of these words leads to the occasion of the dream\u2014which this\ntime is significant. I had brought home to my wife several volumes by a\nwell-known author, who is a friend of my brother\u2019s, and who, as I have\nlearned, comes from the same town as I (J. J. David). One evening she\nspoke to me about the profound impression which the touching sadness of\na story in one of David\u2019s novels, about a talented but degenerate\nperson, had made upon her, and our conversation turned upon the\nindications of talent which we perceive in our own children. Under the\ninfluence of what she had just read, my wife expressed a concern\nrelative to our children, and I comforted her with the remark that it is\njust such dangers that can be averted by education. During the night my\ntrain of thoughts proceeded further, took up the concern of my wife, and\nconnected with it all sorts of other things. An opinion which the poet\nhad expressed to my brother upon the subject of marriage showed my\nthoughts a by-path which might lead to a representation in the dream.\nThis path led to Breslau, into which city a lady who was a very good\nfriend of ours had married. I found in Breslau Lasker and Lasalle as\nexamples realising our concern about being ruined at the hands of a\nwoman, examples which enabled me to represent both manifestations of\nthis influence for the bad at once.[DP] The \u201cCherchez la femme,\u201d in\nwhich these thoughts may be summed up, when taken in another sense,\nbrings me to my brother, who is still unmarried and whose name is\nAlexander. Now I see that Alex, as we abbreviate the name, sounds almost\nlike inversion of Lasker and that this factor must have taken part in\ngiving my thoughts their detour by way of Breslau.\nBut this playing with names and syllables in which I am here engaged\ncontains still another meaning. The wish that my brother may have a\nhappy family life is represented by it in the following manner. In the\nartistic romance _L\u2019\u0152uvre_, the writer, as is well known, has\nincidentally given an episodic account of himself and of his own family\nhappiness, and he appears under the name of _Sandoz_. Probably he has\ntaken the following course in the name transformation. _Zola_ when\ninverted (as children like so much to do) gives _Aloz_. But that was\nstill too undisguised for him; therefore he replaced the syllable _Al_,\nwhich stands at the beginning of the name Alexander, by the third\nsyllable of the same name, _sand_, and thus _Sandoz_ came about. In a\nsimilar manner my _autodidasker_ originated.\nMy fancy, that I am telling Professor N. that the patient whom we had\nboth seen is suffering from a neurosis, got into the dream in the\nfollowing manner. Shortly before the close of my working year I received\na patient in whose case my diagnosis failed me. A serious organic\naffliction\u2014perhaps some changes in the spine\u2014was to be assumed, but\ncould not be proved. It would have been tempting to diagnose the trouble\nas a neurosis, and this would have put an end to all difficulties, had\nit not been for the fact that the sexual anamnesis, without which I am\nunwilling to admit a neurosis, was so energetically denied by the\npatient. In my embarrassment I called to my assistance the physician\nwhom I respect most of all men (as others do also), and to whose\nauthority I surrender most completely. He listened to my doubts, told me\nhe thought them justified, and then said: \u201cKeep on observing the man, it\nis probably a neurosis.\u201d Since I know that he does not share my opinions\nabout the etiology of neuroses, I suppressed my disagreement, but I did\nnot conceal my scepticism. A few days after I informed the patient that\nI did not know what to do with him, and advised him to go to some one\nelse. Thereupon, to my great astonishment, he began to beg my pardon for\nhaving lied to me, saying that he had felt very much ashamed; and now he\nrevealed to me just that piece of sexual etiology which I had expected,\nand which I found necessary for assuming the existence of a neurosis.\nThis was a relief to me, but at the same time a humiliation; for I had\nto admit that my consultant, who was not disconcerted by the absence of\nanamnesis, had made a correct observation. I made up my mind to tell him\nabout it when I saw him again, and to say to him that he had been in the\nright and I in the wrong.\nThis is just what I do in the dream. But what sort of a wish is supposed\nto be fulfilled if I acknowledge that I am in the wrong? This is exactly\nmy wish; I wish to be in the wrong with my apprehensions\u2014that is to say,\nI wish that my wife whose fears I have appropriated in the dream\nthoughts may remain in the wrong. The subject to which the matter of\nbeing in the right or in the wrong is related in the dream is not far\ndistant from what is really interesting to the dream thoughts. It is the\nsame pair of alternatives of either organic or functional impairment\nthrough a woman, more properly through the sexual life\u2014either tabetic\nparalysis or a neurosis\u2014with which the manner of Lasalle\u2019s ruin is more\nor less loosely connected.\nIn this well-joined dream (which, however, is quite transparent with the\nhelp of careful analysis) Professor N. plays a part not merely on\naccount of this analogy and of my wish to remain in the wrong, or on\naccount of the associated references to Breslau and to the family of our\nfriend who is married there\u2014but also on account of the following little\noccurrence which was connected with our consultation. After he had\nattended to our medical task by giving the above mentioned suggestion,\nhis interest was directed to personal matters. \u201cHow many children have\nyou now?\u201d\u2014\u201cSix.\u201d\u2014A gesture of respect and reflection.\u2014\u201cGirls,\nboys?\u201d\u2014\u201cThree of each. They are my pride and my treasure.\u201d\u2014\u201cWell, there\nis no difficulty about the girls, but the boys give trouble later on in\ntheir education.\u201d I replied that until now they had been very tractable;\nthis second diagnosis concerning the future of my boys of course pleased\nme as little as the one he had made earlier, namely, that my patient had\nonly a neurosis. These two impressions, then, are bound together by\ncontiguity, by being successively received, and if I incorporate the\nstory of the neurosis into the dream, I substitute it for the\nconversation upon education which shows itself to be even more closely\nconnected with the dream thoughts owing to the fact that it has such an\nintimate bearing upon the subsequently expressed concerns of my wife.\nThus even my fear that N. may turn out to be right in his remarks on the\neducational difficulties in the case of boys is admitted into the dream\ncontent, in that it is concealed behind the representation of my wish\nthat I may be wrong in such apprehensions. The same fancy serves without\nchange to represent both conflicting alternatives.\nThe verbal compositions of the dream are very similar to those which are\nknown to occur in paranoia, but which are also found in hysteria and in\ncompulsive ideas. The linguistic habits of children, who at certain\nperiods actually treat words as objects and invent new languages and\nartificial syntaxes, are in this case the common source for the dream as\nwell as for psychoneuroses.\nWhen speeches occur in the dream, which are expressly distinguished from\nthoughts as such, it is an invariable rule that the dream speech has\noriginated from a remembered speech in the dream material. Either the\nwording has been preserved in its integrity, or it has been slightly\nchanged in the course of expression; frequently the dream speech is\npieced together from various recollections of speeches, while the\nwording has remained the same and the meaning has possibly been changed\nso as to have two or more significations. Not infrequently the dream\nspeech serves merely as an allusion to an incident, at which the\nrecollected speech occurred.[DQ]\n(_b_) _The Work of Displacement_\nAnother sort of relation, which is no less significant, must have come\nto our notice while we were collecting examples of dream condensation.\nWe have seen that those elements which obtrude themselves in the dream\ncontent as its essential components play a part in the dream thoughts\nwhich is by no means the same. As a correlative to this the converse of\nthis thesis is also true. That which is clearly the essential thing in\nthe dream thoughts need not be represented in the dream at all. The\ndream, as it were, is _eccentric_; its contents are grouped about other\nelements than the dream thoughts as a central point. Thus, for example,\nin the dream about the botanical monograph the central point of the\ndream content is apparently the element \u201cbotanical\u201d; in the dream\nthoughts we are concerned with the complications and conflicts which\nresult from services rendered among colleagues which put them under\nobligations to one another, subsequently with the reproach that I am in\nthe habit of sacrificing too much to my hobbies, and the element\n\u201cbotanical\u201d would in no case find a place in this nucleus of the dream\nthoughts if it were not loosely connected with it by an antithesis, for\nbotany was never among my favourite studies. In the Sappho dream of my\npatient the ascending and descending, being upstairs and down, is made\nthe central point; the dream, however, is concerned with the danger of\nsexual relations with persons of low _degree_, so that only one of the\nelements of the dream thoughts seems to have been taken over into the\ndream content, albeit with unseemly elaboration. Similarly in the dream\nabout June bugs, whose subject is the relation of sexuality to cruelty,\nthe factor of cruelty has indeed reappeared but in a different\nconnection and without the mention of the sexual, that is to say, it has\nbeen torn from its context and transformed into something strange.\nAgain, in the dream about my uncle, the blond beard, which seems to be\nits central point, appears to have no rational connection with the\nwishes for greatness which we have recognised as the nucleus of the\ndream thoughts. It is only to be expected if such dreams give a\ndisplaced impression. In complete contrast to these examples, the dream\nof Irma\u2019s injection shows that individual elements can claim the same\nplace in the formation of dreams which they occupy in the dream\nthoughts. The recognition of these new and entirely variable relations\nbetween the dream thoughts and the dream content is at first likely to\nexcite our astonishment. If we find in a psychic process of normal life\nthat an idea has been culled from among a number of others, and has\nacquired particular vividness in our consciousness, we are in the habit\nof regarding this result as a proof that the victorious idea is endowed\nwith a peculiarly high degree of psychic value\u2014a certain degree of\ninterest. We now discover that this value of the individual elements in\nthe dream thoughts is not preserved in the formation of the dream, or\ndoes not come into consideration. For there is no doubt as to the\nelements of the dream thoughts which are of the highest value; our\njudgment tells us immediately. In the formation of dreams those elements\nwhich are emphasized with intense interest may be treated as though they\nwere inferior, and other elements are put in their place which certainly\nwere inferior in the dream thoughts. We are at first given the\nimpression that the psychic intensity[DR] of the individual ideas does\nnot come into consideration at all for the selection made by the dream,\nbut only their greater or smaller multiplicity of determination. Not\nwhat is important in the dream thoughts gets into the dream, but what is\ncontained in them several times over, one might be inclined to think;\nbut our understanding of the formation of dreams is not much furthered\nby this assumption, for at the outset it will be impossible to believe\nthat the two factors of manifold determination and of integral value do\nnot tend in the same direction in the influence they exert on the\nselection made by the dream. Those ideas in the dream thoughts which are\nmost important are probably also those which recur most frequently, for\nthe individual dream thoughts radiate from them as from central points.\nAnd still the dream may reject those elements which are especially\nemphasized and which receive manifold support, and may take up into its\ncontent elements which are endowed only with the latter property.\nThis difficulty may be solved by considering another impression received\nin the investigation of the manifold determination of the dream content.\nPerhaps many a reader has already passed his own judgment upon this\ninvestigation by saying that the manifold determination of the elements\nof the dream is not a significant discovery, because it is a\nself-evident one. In the analysis one starts from the dream elements,\nand registers all the notions which are connected with them; it is no\nwonder, then, that these elements should occur with particular frequency\nin the thought material which is obtained in this manner. I cannot\nacknowledge the validity of this objection, but shall say something\nmyself which sounds like it. Among the thoughts which analysis brings to\nlight, many can be found which are far removed from the central idea of\nthe dream, and which appear distinguished from the rest as artificial\ninterpolations for a definite purpose. Their purpose may easily be\ndiscovered; they are just the ones which establish a connection, often a\nforced and far-fetched one, between the dream content and the dream\nthoughts, and if these elements were to be weeded out, not only\nover-determination but also a sufficient determination by means of the\ndream thoughts would often be lacking for the dream content. We are thus\nled to the conclusion that manifold determination, which decides the\nselection made by the dream, is perhaps not always a primary factor in\ndream formation, but is often the secondary manifestation of a psychic\npower which is still unknown to us. But in spite of all this, manifold\ndetermination must nevertheless control the entrance of individual\nelements into the dream, for it is possible to observe that it is\nestablished with considerable effort in cases where it does not result\nfrom the dream material without assistance.\nThe assumption is not now far distant that a psychic force is expressed\nin dream activity which on the one hand strips elements of high psychic\nvalue of their intensity, and which on the other hand creates new\nvalues, _by way of over-determination_, from elements of small value,\nthese new values subsequently getting into the dream content. If this is\nthe method of procedure, there has taken place in the formation of the\ndream a transference and displacement of the psychic intensities of the\nindividual elements, of which the textual difference between the dream\nand the thought content appears as a result. The process which we assume\nhere is nothing less than the essential part of the dream activity; it\nmerits the designation of _dream displacement_. _Dream displacement_ and\n_dream condensation_ are the two craftsmen to whom we may chiefly\nattribute the moulding of the dream.\nI think we also have an easy task in recognising the psychic force which\nmakes itself felt in the circumstances of dream displacement. The result\nof this displacement is that the dream content no longer resembles the\ncore of the dream thoughts at all, and that the dream reproduces only a\ndisfigured form of the dream-wish in the unconscious. But we are already\nacquainted with dream disfigurement; we have traced it back to the\ncensorship which one psychic instance in the psychic life exercises upon\nthe other. Dream displacement is one of the chief means for achieving\nthis disfigurement. _Is fecit, cui profuit._ We may assume that dream\ndisplacement is brought about by the influence of this censor, of the\nendopsychic repulsion.[DS]\nThe manner in which the factors of displacement, condensation, and\nover-determination play into one another in the formation of the dream,\nwhich is the ruling factor and which the subordinate one, all this will\nbe reserved as the subject of later investigations. For the present we\nmay state, as a second condition which the elements must satisfy in\norder to get into the dream, that _they must be withdrawn from the\ncensor of resistance_. From now on we shall take account of dream\ndisplacement as an unquestionable fact in the interpretation of dreams.\n(_c_) _Means of Representation in the Dream_\nBesides the two factors of dream condensation and dream displacement\nwhich we have found to be active in the transformation of the latent\ndream material into the manifest content, we shall come in the course of\nthis investigation upon two other conditions which exercise an\nunquestionable influence upon the selection of the material which gets\ninto the dream. Even at the risk of seeming to stop our progress, I\nshould like to glance at the processes by which the interpretation of\ndreams is accomplished. I do not deny that I should succeed best in\nmaking them clear, and in showing that they are sufficiently reliable to\ninsure them against attack, by taking a single dream as a paradigm and\ndeveloping its interpretation, as I have done in Chapter II. in the\ndream of \u201cIrma\u2019s Injection,\u201d and then putting together the dream\nthoughts which I have discovered, and reconstructing the formation of\nthe dream from them\u2014that is to say, by supplementing the analysis of\ndreams by a synthesis of them. I have accomplished this with several\nspecimens for my own instruction; but I cannot undertake to do it here\nbecause I am prevented by considerations, which every right-minded\nperson must approve of, relative to the psychic material necessary for\nsuch a demonstration. In the analysis of dreams these considerations\npresent less difficulty, for an analysis may be incomplete and still\nretain its value even if it leads only a short way into the thought\nlabyrinth of the dream. I do not see how a synthesis could be anything\nshort of complete in order to be convincing. I could give a complete\nsynthesis only of the dreams of such persons as are unknown to the\nreading public. Since, however, only neurotic patients furnish me with\nthe means for doing this, this part of the description of the dream must\nbe postponed until I can carry the psychological explanation of neuroses\nfar enough\u2014elsewhere\u2014to be able to show their connection with the\nsubject matter under consideration.[DT]\nFrom my attempts synthetically to construct dreams from the dream\nthoughts, I know that the material which is obtained from interpretation\nvaries in value. For a part of it consists of the essential dream\nthoughts which would, therefore, completely replace the dream, and which\nwould in themselves be sufficient for this replacement if there were no\ncensor for the dream. The other part may be summed up under the term\n\u201ccollaterals\u201d; taken as a whole they represent the means by which the\nreal wish that arises from the dream thoughts is transformed into the\ndream-wish. A first part of these \u201ccollaterals\u201d consists of allusions to\nthe actual dream thoughts, which, considered schematically, correspond\nto displacements from the essential to the non-essential. A second part\ncomprises the thoughts which connect these non-essential elements, that\nhave become significant through displacement with one another, and which\nreach from them into the dream content. Finally a third part contains\nthe ideas and thought connections which (in the work of interpretation)\nconduct us from the dream content to the intermediary collaterals, _all\nof which_ need not _necessarily_ have participated in the formation of\nthe dream.\nAt this point we are interested exclusively in the essential dream\nthoughts. These are usually found to be a complex of thoughts and\nmemories of the most intricate possible construction, and to possess all\nthe properties of the thought processes which are known to us from\nwaking life. Not infrequently they are trains of thought which proceed\nfrom more than one centre, but which do not lack points of connection;\nalmost regularly a chain of thought stands next to its contradictory\ncorrelative, being connected with it by contrast associations.\nThe individual parts of this complicated structure naturally stand in\nthe most manifold logical relations to one another. They constitute a\nforeground or background, digressions, illustrations, conditions, chains\nof argument, and objections. When the whole mass of these dream thoughts\nis subjected to the pressure of the dream activity, during which the\nparts are turned about, broken up, and pushed together, something like\ndrifting ice, there arises the question, what becomes of the logical\nties which until now had given form to the structure? What\nrepresentation do \u201cif,\u201d \u201cbecause,\u201d \u201cas though,\u201d \u201calthough,\u201d \u201ceither\u2014or,\u201d\nand all the other conjunctions, without which we cannot understand a\nphrase or a sentence, receive in the dream?\nAt first we must answer that the dream has at its disposal no means for\nrepresenting these logical relations among the dream thoughts. In most\ncases it disregards all these conjunctions, and undertakes the\nelaboration only of the objective content of the dream thoughts. It is\nleft to the interpretation of the dream to restore the coherence which\nthe activity of the dream has destroyed.\nIf the dream lacks ability to express these relations, the psychic\nmaterial of which the dream is wrought must be responsible. The\ndescriptive arts are limited in the same manner\u2014painting and the plastic\narts in comparison with poetry, which can employ speech; and here too\nthe reason for this impotence is to be found in the material in the\ntreatment of which the two arts strive to give expression to something.\nBefore the art of painting had arrived at an understanding of the laws\nof expression by which it is bound, it attempted to escape this\ndisadvantage. In old paintings little tags were hung from the mouths of\nthe persons represented giving the speech, the expression of which in\nthe picture the artist despaired of.\nPerhaps an objection will here be raised challenging the assertion that\nthe dream dispenses with the representation of logical relations. There\nare dreams in which the most complicated intellectual operations take\nplace, in which proof and refutation are offered, puns and comparisons\nmade, just as in waking thoughts. But here, too, appearances are\ndeceitful; if the interpretation of such dreams is pursued, it is found\nthat all of this is _dream material, not the representation of\nintellectual activity in the dream_. The _content_ of the dream thoughts\nis reproduced by the apparent thinking of the dream, not _the relations\nof the dream thoughts to one another_, in the determination of which\nrelations thinking consists. I shall give examples of this. But the\nthesis which is most easily established is that all speeches which occur\nin the dream, and which are expressly designated as such, are unchanged\nor only slightly modified copies of speeches which are likewise to be\nfound in the recollections of the dream material. Often the speech is\nonly an allusion to an event contained in the dream thoughts; the\nmeaning of the dream is a quite different one.\nI shall not deny, indeed, that there is also critical thought activity\nwhich does not merely repeat material from the dream thoughts and which\ntakes part in the formation of the dream. I shall have to explain the\ninfluence of this factor at the close of this discussion. It will then\nbecome clear that this thought activity is evoked not by the dream\nthoughts, but by the dream itself after it is already finished in a\ncertain sense.\nWe shall, therefore, consider it settled for the present that the\nlogical relations among the dream thoughts do not enjoy any particular\nrepresentation in the dream. For instance, where there is a\ncontradiction in the dream, this is either a contradiction directed\nagainst the dream itself or a contradiction derived from the content of\none of the dream thoughts; a contradiction in the dream corresponds to a\ncontradiction _among_ the dream thoughts only in a highly indirect\nmanner.\nBut just as the art of painting finally succeeded in depicting in the\nrepresented persons, at least their intention in speaking\u2014their\ntenderness, threatening attitude, warning mien, and the like\u2014by other\nmeans than the dangling tag, so also the dream has found it possible to\nrender account of a few of the logical relations among its dream\nthoughts by means of an appropriate modification of the peculiar method\nof dream representation. It will be found by experience that different\ndreams go to different lengths in taking this into consideration; while\none dream entirely disregards the logical coherence of its material,\nanother attempts to indicate it as completely as possible. In so doing\nthe dream departs more or less widely from the subject-matter which it\nis to elaborate. The dream also takes a similarly varying attitude\ntowards the temporal coherence of the dream thoughts, if such coherence\nhas been established in the unconscious (as for example in the dream of\nIrma\u2019s injection).\nBut what are the means by which the dream activity is enabled to\nindicate these relations in the dream material which are so difficult to\nrepresent? I shall attempt to enumerate these separately.\nIn the first place, the dream renders account of the connection which is\nundeniably present between all the parts of the dream thoughts by\nuniting this material in a single composition as a situation or process.\nIt reproduces _logical connection in the form of simultaneousness_; in\nthis case it acts something like the painter who groups together all the\nphilosophers or poets into a picture of the school of Athens or of\nParnassus, although these were never at once present in any hall or on\nany mountain top\u2014though they do, however, form a unity from the point of\nview of reflective contemplation.\nThe dream carries out this method of representation in detail. Whenever\nit shows two elements close together, it vouches for a particularly\nintimate connection between those elements which correspond to them in\nthe dream thoughts. It is as in our method of writing: _to_ signifies\nthat the two letters are to be pronounced as one syllable, while _t_\nwith _o_ after a free space shows that _t_ is the last letter of one\nword and _o_ the first letter of another. According to this, dream\ncombinations are not made of arbitrary, completely incongruent elements\nof the dream material, but of elements that also have a somewhat\nintimate relation to one another in the dream thoughts.\nFor representing causal relation the dream has two methods, which are\nessentially reducible to one. The more frequent method, in cases, for\nexample, where the dream thoughts are to the effect: \u201cBecause this was\nso and so, this and that must happen,\u201d consists in making the premise an\nintroductory dream and joining the conclusion to it in the form of the\nmain dream. If my interpretation is correct, the sequence may also be\nreversed. That part of the dream which is more completely worked out\nalways corresponds to the conclusion.\nA female patient, whose dream I shall later give in full, once furnished\nme with a neat example of such a representation of causal relationship.\nThe dream consisted of a short prologue and of a very elaborate but well\norganised dream composition, which might be entitled: \u201cA flower of\nspeech.\u201d The prologue of the dream is as follows: _She goes to the two\nmaids in the kitchen and scolds them for taking so long to prepare \u201ca\nlittle bite of food.\u201d She also sees a great many coarse dishes standing\nin the kitchen, inverted so that the water may drop off them, and heaped\nup in a pile. The two maids go to fetch water, and must, as it were,\nstep into a river, which reaches up to the house or into the yard._\nThen follows the main dream, which begins as follows: _She is descending\nfrom a high place, over balustrades that are curiously fashioned, and\nshe is glad that her dress doesn\u2019t get caught anywhere_, &c. Now the\nintroductory dream refers to the house of the lady\u2019s parents. Probably\nshe has often heard from her mother the words which are spoken in the\nkitchen. The piles of unwashed dishes are taken from an unpretentious\nearthenware shop which was located in the same house. The second part of\nthis dream contains an allusion to the dreamer\u2019s father, who always had\na great deal to do with servant girls, and who later contracted a fatal\ndisease during a flood\u2014the house stood near the bank of a river. The\nthought which is concealed behind the introductory dream, then, is to\nthis effect: \u201cBecause I was born in this house, under such limited and\nunlovely circumstances.\u201d The main dream takes up the same thought, and\npresents it in a form that has been altered by the tendency to\nwish-fulfilment: \u201cI am of exalted origin.\u201d Properly then: \u201cBecause I was\nborn in such low circumstances, my career has been so and so.\u201d\nAs far as I can see, the partition of a dream into two unequal portions\ndoes not always signify a causal relation between the thoughts of the\ntwo portions. It often appears as though the same material were being\npresented in the two dreams from different points of view; or as though\nthe two dreams have proceeded from two separated centres in the dream\nmaterial and their contents overlap, so that the object which is the\ncentre of one dream has served in the other as an allusion, and _vice\nversa_. But in a certain number of cases a division into shorter\nfore-dreams and longer subsequent dreams actually signifies a causal\nrelation between the two portions. The other method of representing\ncausal relation is used with less abundant material and consists in the\nchange of one image in the dream, whether a person or a thing, into\nanother. It is only in cases where we witness this change taking place\nin the dream that any causal relation is asserted to exist, not where we\nmerely notice that one thing has taken the place of another. I said that\nboth methods of representing causal relation are reducible to the same\nthing; in both cases _causation_ is represented by a _succession_, now\nby the sequence of the dreams, now by the immediate transformation of\none image into another. In the great majority of cases, of course,\ncausal relation is not expressed at all, but is obliterated by the\nsequence of elements which is unavoidable in the dream process.\nThe dream is altogether unable to express the alternative, \u201ceither\u2014or\u201d;\nit is in the habit of taking both members of this alternative into one\ncontext, as though they were equally privileged. A classic example of\nthis is contained in the dream of Irma\u2019s injection. Its latent thoughts\nobviously mean: I am innocent of the continued presence of Irma\u2019s pains;\nthe fault rests either with her resistance to accepting the solution,\n_or_ with the fact that she is living under unfavourable sexual\nconditions, which I am unable to change, _or_ her pains are not of a\nhysteric nature at all, but organic. The dream, however, fulfils all\nthese possibilities, which are almost exclusive, and is quite ready to\nextract from the dream-wish an additional fourth solution of this kind.\nAfter interpreting the dream I have therefore inserted the _either\u2014or_\nin the sequence of the dream thoughts.\nIn the case where the dreamer finds occasion in telling the dream to use\n_either\u2014or_: \u201cIt was either a garden or a living-room,\u201d &c., it is not\nreally an alternative which occurs in the dream thoughts, but an \u201cand,\u201d\na simple addition. When we use _either\u2014or_ we are usually describing a\ncharacteristic of indistinctness belonging to an element of the dream\nwhich is still capable of being cleared up. The rule of interpretation\nfor this case is as follows: The separate members of the alternative are\nto be treated as equals and connected by \u201cand.\u201d For instance, after\nwaiting for a long time in vain for the address of my friend who is\nliving in Italy, I dream that I receive a telegram which tells me this\naddress. Upon the strip of telegraph paper I see printed in blue the\nfollowing; the first word is blurred:\nperhaps _via_,\nor _villa_, the second is distinctly: _Sezerno_ or perhaps (_Casa_).\nThe second word, which sounds like an Italian name and which reminds me\nof our etymological discussions, also expresses my displeasure on\naccount of the fact that my friend has kept his place of residence\nsecret from me for so long a time; every member of the triple suggestion\nfor the first word may be recognised in the course of analysis as a\nself-sufficient and equally well-justified starting point in the\nconcatenation of ideas.\nDuring the night before the funeral of my father I dreamed of a printed\nplacard, a card or poster\u2014perhaps something like signs in railway\nwaiting-rooms which announce the prohibition of smoking\u2014which reads\neither:\n_It is requested to shut the eyes_\nor\n_It is requested to shut an eye_\nwhich I am in the habit of representing in the following form:\n_the_\n_It is requested to shut_       _eye(s)._\n_an_\nEach of the two variations has its own particular meaning, and leads us\nalong particular paths in the interpretation of the dream. I had made\nthe simplest kind of funeral arrangements, for I knew how the deceased\nthought about such matters. Other members of the family, however, did\nnot approve of such puritanic simplicity; they thought we would have to\nbe ashamed before the mourners. Hence one of the wordings of the dream\nrequests the \u201cshutting of one eye,\u201d that is to say, that people should\nshow consideration. The significance of the blurring, which we describe\nwith an _either\u2014or_, may here be seen with particular ease. The dream\nactivity has not succeeded in constructing a unified but at the same\ntime ambiguous wording for the dream thoughts. Thus the two main trains\nof thought are already distinguished even in the dream content.\nIn a few cases the division of the dream into two equal parts expresses\nthe alternative which the dream finds it so difficult to represent.\nThe attitude of the dream towards the category of antithesis and\ncontradiction is most striking. This category is unceremoniously\nneglected; the word \u201cNo\u201d does not seem to exist for the dream.\nAntitheses are with peculiar preference reduced to unity or represented\nas one. The dream also takes the liberty of representing any element\nwhatever by its desired opposite, so that it is at first impossible to\ntell about any element capable of having an opposite, whether it is to\nbe taken negatively or positively, in the dream thoughts.[DU] In one of\nthe last-mentioned dreams, whose introductory portion we have already\ninterpreted (\u201cbecause my parentage is such\u201d), the dreamer descends over\na balustrade and holds a blossoming twig in her hands. Since this\npicture suggests to her the angel in paintings of the Annunciation (her\nown name is Mary) carrying a lily stem in his hand, and the white-robed\ngirls marching in the procession on Corpus Christi Day when the streets\nare decorated with green bows, the blossoming twig in the dream is very\ncertainly an allusion to sexual innocence. But the twig is thickly\nstudded with red blossoms, each one of which resembles a camelia. At the\nend of her walk, so the dream continues, the blossoms have already\nfallen considerably apart; then unmistakable allusions to menstruation\nfollow. But this very twig which is carried like a lily and as though by\nan innocent girl, is also an allusion to Camille, who, as is known,\nalways wore a white camelia, but a red one at the time of her\nmenstruation. The same blossoming twig (\u201cthe flower of maidenhood\u201d in\nthe songs about the miller\u2019s daughter by Goethe) represents at once\nsexual innocence and its opposite. The same dream, also, which expresses\nthe dreamer\u2019s joy at having succeeded in passing through life unsullied,\nhints in several places (as at the falling-off of the blossom), at the\nopposite train of thought\u2014namely, that she had been guilty of various\nsins against sexual purity (that is in her childhood). In the analysis\nof the dream we may clearly distinguish the two trains of thought, of\nwhich the comforting one seems to be superficial, the reproachful one\nmore profound. The two are diametrically opposed to each other, and\ntheir like but contrasting elements have been represented by the\nidentical dream elements.\nThe mechanism of dream formation is favourable in the highest degree to\nonly one of the logical relations. This relation is that of similarity,\ncorrespondence, contiguity, \u201cas though,\u201d which is capable of being\nrepresented in the dream as no other can be, by the most varied\nexpedients. The correspondences occurring in the dream, or cases of \u201cas\nthough,\u201d are the chief points of support for the formation of dreams,\nand no inconsiderable part of the dream activity consists in creating\nnew correspondences of this sort in cases where those which are already\nat hand are prevented by the censor of resistance from getting into the\ndream. The effort towards condensation shown by the dream activity\nassists in the representation of the relation of similarity.\n_Similarity_, _agreement_, _community_, are quite generally expressed in\nthe dream by concentration into a _unity_, which is either already found\nin the dream material or is newly created. The first case may be\nreferred to as _identification_, the second as _composition_.\nIdentification is used where the dream is concerned with persons,\ncomposition where things are the objects of unification; but\ncompositions are also made from persons. Localities are often treated as\npersons.\nIdentification consists in giving representation in the dream content to\nonly one of a number of persons who are connected by some common\nfeature, while the second or the other persons seem to be suppressed as\nfar as the dream is concerned. This one representative person in the\ndream enters into all the relations and situations which belong to\nitself or to the persons who are covered by it. In cases of composition,\nhowever, when this has to do with persons, there are already present in\nthe dream image features which are characteristic of, but not common to,\nthe persons in question, so that a new unity, a composite person,\nappears as the result of the union of these features. The composition\nitself may be brought about in various ways. Either the dream person\nbears the name of one of the persons to whom it refers\u2014and then we know,\nin a manner which is quite analogous to knowledge in waking life, that\nthis or that person is the one who is meant\u2014while the visual features\nbelong to another person; or the dream image itself is composed of\nvisual features which in reality are shared by both. Instead of visual\nfeatures, also, the part played by the second person may be represented\nby the mannerisms which are usually ascribed to him, the words which he\nusually speaks, or the situations in which he is usually imagined. In\nthe latter method of characterisation the sharp distinction between\nidentification and composition of persons begins to disappear. But it\nmay also happen that the formation of such a mixed personality is\nunsuccessful. The situation of the dream is then attributed to one\nperson, and the other\u2014as a rule the more important one\u2014is introduced as\nan inactive and unconcerned spectator. The dreamer relates something\nlike \u201cMy mother was also there\u201d (Stekel).\nThe common feature which justifies the union of the two persons\u2014that is\nto say, which is the occasion for it\u2014may either be represented in the\ndream or be absent. As a rule, identification or composition of persons\nsimply serves the purpose of dispensing with the representation of this\ncommon feature. Instead of repeating: \u201cA is ill disposed towards me, and\nB is also,\u201d I make a composite person of A and B in the dream, or I\nconceive A as doing an unaccustomed action which usually characterises\nB. The dream person obtained in this way appears in the dream in some\nnew connection, and the fact that it signifies both A and B justifies me\nin inserting that which is common to both\u2014their hostility towards me\u2014at\nthe proper place in the interpretation of the dream. In this manner I\noften achieve a very extraordinary degree of condensation of the dream\ncontent; I can save myself the direct representation of very complicated\nrelations belonging to a person, if I can find a second person who has\nan equal claim to a part of these relations. It is also obvious to what\nextent this representation by means of identification can circumvent the\nresisting censor, which makes the dream activity conform to such harsh\nconditions. That which offends the censor may lie in those very ideas\nwhich are connected in the dream material with the one person; I now\nfind a second person, who likewise has relation to the objectionable\nmaterial, but only to a part of it. The contact in that one point which\noffends the censor now justified me in forming a composite person, which\nis characterised on either hand by indifferent features. This person\nresulting from composition or identification, who is unobjectionable to\nthe censor, is now suited for incorporation in the dream content, and by\nthe application of dream condensation I have satisfied the demands of\nthe dream censor.\nIn dreams where a common feature of two persons is represented, this is\nusually a hint to look for another concealed common feature, the\nrepresentation of which is made impossible by the censor. A displacement\nof the common feature has here taken place partly in order to facilitate\nrepresentation. From the circumstance that the composite person appears\nto me with an indifferent common feature, I must infer that another\ncommon feature which is by no means indifferent exists in the dream\nthoughts.\nAccording to what has been said, identification or composition of\npersons serves various purposes in the dream; in the first place, to\nrepresent a feature common to the two persons; secondly, to represent a\ndisplaced common feature; and thirdly, even to give expression to a\ncommunity of features that is merely _wished for_. As the wish for a\ncommunity between two persons frequently coincides with the exchanging\nof these persons, this relation in the dream is also expressed through\nidentification. In the dream of Irma\u2019s injection I wish to exchange this\npatient for another\u2014that is to say, I wish the latter to be my patient\nas the former has been; the dream takes account of this wish by showing\nme a person who is called Irma, but who is examined in a position such\nas I have had the opportunity of seeing only when occupied with the\nother person in question. In the dream about my uncle this substitution\nis made the centre of the dream; I identify myself with the minister by\njudging and treating my colleague as shabbily as he does.\nIt has been my experience\u2014and to this I have found no exception\u2014that\nevery dream treats of one\u2019s own person. Dreams are absolutely egotistic.\nIn cases where not my ego, but only a strange person occurs in the dream\ncontent, I may safely assume that my ego is concealed behind that person\nby means of identification. I am permitted to supplement my ego. On\nother occasions when my ego appears in the dream, I am given to\nunderstand by the situation in which it is placed that another person is\nconcealing himself behind the ego. In this case the dream is intended to\ngive me notice that in the interpretation I must transfer something\nwhich is connected with this person\u2014the hidden common feature\u2014to myself.\nThere are also dreams in which my ego occurs along with other persons\nwhich the resolution of the identification again shows to be my ego. By\nmeans of this identification I am instructed to unite in my ego certain\nideas to whose acceptance the censor has objected. I may also give my\nego manifold representation in the dream, now directly, now by means of\nidentification with strangers. An extraordinary amount of thought\nmaterial may be condensed by means of a few such identifications.[DV]\nThe resolution of the identification of localities designated under\ntheir own names is even less difficult than that of persons, because\nhere the disturbing influence of the ego, which is all-powerful in the\ndream, is lacking. In one of my dreams about Rome (p. 164) the name of\nthe place in which I find myself is Rome; I am surprised, however, at\nthe great number of German placards at a street corner. The latter is a\nwish-fulfilment, which immediately suggests Prague; the wish itself\nprobably originated at a period in my youth when I was imbued with a\nGerman nationalistic spirit which is suppressed to-day. At the time of\nmy dream I was looking forward to meeting a friend in Prague; the\nidentification of Rome and Prague is thus to be explained by means of a\ndesired common feature; I would rather meet my friend in Rome than in\nPrague, I should like to exchange Prague for Rome for the purpose of\nthis meeting.\nThe possibility of creating compositions is one of the chief causes of\nthe phantastic character so common in dreams, in that it introduces into\nthe dream elements which could never have been the objects of\nperception. The psychic process which occurs in the formation of\ncompositions is obviously the same which we employ in conceiving or\nfashioning a centaur or a dragon in waking life. The only difference is\nthat in the phantastic creations occurring in waking life the intended\nimpression to be made by the new creation is itself the deciding factor,\nwhile the composition of the dream is determined by an influence\u2014the\ncommon feature in the dream thoughts\u2014which is independent of the form of\nthe image. The composition of the dream may be accomplished in a great\nmany different ways. In the most artless method of execution the\nproperties of the one thing are represented, and this representation is\naccompanied by the knowledge that they also belong to another object. A\nmore careful technique unites the features of one object with those of\nthe other in a new image, while it makes skilful use of resemblance\nbetween the two objects which exist in reality. The new creation may\nturn out altogether absurd or only phantastically ingenious, according\nto the subject-matter and the wit operative in the work of composition.\nIf the objects to be condensed into a unity are too incongruous, the\ndream activity is content with creating a composition with a\ncomparatively distinct nucleus, to which are attached less distinct\nmodifications. The unification into one image has here been\nunsuccessful, as it were; the two representations overlap and give rise\nto something like a contest between visual images. If attempt were made\nto construct an idea out of individual images of perception, similar\nrepresentations might be obtained in a drawing.\nDreams naturally abound in such compositions; several examples of these\nI have given in the dreams already analysed; I shall add more. In the\ndream on p. 296, which describes the career of my patient \u201cin flowery\nlanguage,\u201d the dream ego carries a blossoming twig in her hand, which,\nas we have seen, signifies at once innocence and sexual transgression.\nMoreover, the twig recalls cherry-blossoms on account of the manner in\nwhich the blossoms are clustered; the blossoms themselves, separately\nconsidered, are camelias, and finally the whole thing also gives the\nimpression of an _exotic_ plant. The common feature in the elements of\nthis composition is shown by the dream thoughts. The blossoming twig is\nmade up of allusions to presents by which she was induced or should have\nbeen induced to show herself agreeable. So it was with the cherries in\nher childhood and with the stem of camelias in her later years; the\nexotic feature is an illusion to a much-travelled naturalist, who sought\nto win her favour by means of a drawing of a flower. Another female\npatient creates a middle element out of bath-houses at a bathing resort,\nrural outside water-closets, and the garrets of our city dwellings. The\nreference to human nakedness and exposure is common to the two first\nelements; and we may infer from their connection with the third element\nthat (in her childhood) the garret was likewise the scene of exposure. A\ndreamer of the male sex makes a composite locality out of two places in\nwhich \u201ctreatment\u201d is given\u2014my office and the public hall in which he\nfirst became acquainted with his wife. Another female patient, after her\nelder brother has promised to regale her with caviare, dreams that his\nlegs are covered thick with black caviare pearls. The two elements,\n\u201ccontagion\u201d in a moral sense and the recollection of a cutaneous\neruption in childhood which made her legs look as though studded over\nwith red dots instead of black ones, have here been united with the\ncaviare pearls to form a new idea\u2014the idea of \u201cwhat she has inherited\nfrom her brother.\u201d In this dream parts of the human body are treated as\nobjects, as is usually the case in dreams. In one of the dreams reported\nby Ferenczi[87] there occurred a composition made up of the person of a\nphysician and a horse, over which was spread a night-shirt. The common\nfeature in these three components was shown in the analysis after the\nnight-shirt had been recognised as an allusion to the father of the\ndreamer in an infantile scene. In each of the three cases there was some\nobject of her sexual inquisitiveness. As a child she had often been\ntaken by her nurse to the military breeding station, where she had the\namplest opportunity to satisfy her curiosity, which was at that time\nuninhibited.\nI have already asserted that the dream has no means for expressing the\nrelation of contradiction, of contrast, of negation. I am about to\ncontradict this assertion for the first time. A part of the cases, which\nmay be summed up under the word \u201ccontrast,\u201d finds representation, as we\nhave seen, simply by means of identification\u2014that is, when an\ninterchange or replacement can be connected with the contrast. We have\ngiven repeated examples of this. Another part of the contrasts in the\ndream thoughts, which perhaps falls into the category \u201cturned into the\nopposite,\u201d is represented in the dream in the following remarkable\nmanner, which may almost be designated as witty. The \u201c_inversion_\u201d does\nnot itself get into the dream content, but manifests its presence there\nby means of the fact that a part of the already formed dream\ncontent which lies at hand for other reasons, is\u2014as it were\nsubsequently\u2014inverted. It is easier to illustrate this process than to\ndescribe it. In the beautiful \u201cUp and Down\u201d dream (p. 267) the\nrepresentation of ascending is an inversion of a prototype in the dream\nthoughts, that is to say, of the introductory scene of Daudet\u2019s\n_Sappho_; in the dream climbing is difficult at first, and easy later\non, while in the actual scene it is easy at first, and later becomes\nmore and more difficult. Likewise \u201cabove\u201d and \u201cbelow\u201d in relation to the\ndreamer\u2019s brother are inverted in the dream. This points to a relation\nof contraries or contrasts as obtaining between two parts of the\nsubject-matter of the dream thoughts and the relation we have found in\nthe fact that in the childish fancy of the dreamer he is carried by his\nnurse, while in the novel, on the contrary, the hero carries his\nbeloved. My dream about Goethe\u2019s attack upon Mr. M. (p. 345) also\ncontains an \u201cinversion\u201d of this sort, which must first be set right\nbefore the interpretation of the dream can be accomplished. In the dream\nGoethe attacks a young man, Mr. M.; in reality, according to the dream\nthoughts, an eminent man, my friend, has been attacked by an unknown\nyoung author. In the dream I reckon time from the date of Goethe\u2019s\ndeath; in reality the reckoning was made from the year in which the\nparalytic was born. The thought determining the dream material is shown\nto be an objection to the treatment of Goethe as a lunatic. \u201cThe other\nway around,\u201d says the dream; \u201cif you cannot understand the book, it is\nyou who are dull-witted, not the author.\u201d Furthermore, all these dreams\nof inversion seem to contain a reference to the contemptuous phrase, \u201cto\nturn one\u2019s back upon a person\u201d (German: \u201ceinen die Kehrseite zeigen\u201d;\n_cf._ the inversion in respect to the dreamer\u2019s brother in the _Sappho_\ndream). It is also remarkable how frequently inversion becomes necessary\nin dreams which are inspired by repressed homosexual feelings.\nMoreover, inversion or transformation into an opposite is one of the\nfavourite methods of representation, and one of the methods most capable\nof varied application which the dream activity possesses. Its first\nfunction is to create the fulfilment of a wish with reference to a\ndefinite element of the dream-thoughts. \u201cIf it were only just the other\nway!\u201d is often the best expression of the relation of the ego to a\ndisagreeable recollection. But inversion becomes extraordinarily useful\nfor the purposes of the censor, for it brings about in the material\nrepresented a degree of disfiguration which all but paralyses our\nunderstanding of the dream. For this reason it is always permissible, in\ncases where the dream stubbornly refuses to yield its meaning, to try\nthe inversion of definite portions of its manifest content, whereupon\nnot infrequently everything becomes clear.\nBesides this inversion, the subject-matter inversion in temporal\nrelation is not to be overlooked. A frequent device of dream\ndisfigurement consists in presenting the final issue of an occurrence or\nthe conclusion of an argument at the beginning of the dream, or in\nsupplying the premises of a conclusion or the causes of an effect at the\nend of it. Any one who has not considered this technical method of dream\ndisfigurement stands helpless before the problem of dream\ninterpretation.[DW]\nIndeed in some cases we can obtain the sense of the dream only by\nsubjecting the dream content to manifold inversion in different\ndirections. For example, in the dream of a young patient suffering from\na compulsion neurosis, the memory of an infantile death-wish against a\ndreaded father was hidden behind the following words: _His father\nupbraids him because he arrives so late._ But the context in the\npsychoanalytic treatment and the thoughts of the dreamer alike go to\nshow that the sentence must read as follows: _He is angry at his\nfather_, and, further, that his father is always coming home _too early_\n(_i.e._ too soon). He would have preferred that his father should not\ncome home at all, which is identical with the wish (see page 219) that\nhis father should die. As a little boy the dreamer was guilty of sexual\naggression against another person while his father was away, and he was\nthreatened with punishment in the words: \u201cJust wait until father comes\nhome.\u201d\nIf we attempt to trace the relations between dream content and dream\nthoughts further, we shall do this best by making the dream itself our\nstarting-point and by asking ourselves the question: What do certain\nformal characteristics of dream representation signify with reference to\nthe dream thoughts? The formal characteristics which must attract our\nattention in the dream primarily include variations in the distinctness\nof individual parts of the dream or of whole dreams in relation to one\nanother. The variations in the intensity of individual dream images\ninclude a whole scale of degrees ranging from a distinctness of\ndepiction which one is inclined to rate as higher\u2014without warrant, to be\nsure\u2014than that of reality, to a provoking indistinctness which is\ndeclared to be characteristic of the dream, because it cannot altogether\nbe compared to any degree of indistinctness which we ever see in real\nobjects. Moreover, we usually designate the impression which we get from\nan indistinct object in the dream as \u201cfleeting,\u201d while we think of the\nmore distinct dream images as remaining intact for a longer period of\nperception. We must now ask ourselves by what conditions in the dream\nmaterial these differences in the vividness of the different parts of\nthe dream content are brought about.\nThere are certain expectations which will inevitably arise at this point\nand which must be met. Owing to the fact that real sensations during\nsleep may form part of the material of the dream, it will probably be\nassumed that these sensations or the dream elements resulting from them\nare emphasized by peculiar intensity, or conversely, that what turns out\nto be particularly vivid in the dream is probably traceable to such real\nsensations during sleep. My experience has never confirmed this. It is\nincorrect to say that those elements of the dream which are the\nderivatives of impressions occurring in sleep (nervous excitements) are\ndistinguished by their vividness from others which are based on\nrecollections. The factor of reality is of no account in determining the\nintensity of dream images.\nFurthermore, the expectation will be cherished that the sensory\nintensity (vividness) of individual dream images has a relation to the\npsychic intensity of the elements corresponding to them in the\ndream-thoughts. In the latter intensity is identical with psychic value;\nthe most intense elements are in fact the most significant, and these\nare the central point of the dream. We know, however, that it is just\nthese elements which are usually not accepted in the dream content owing\nto the censor. But still it might be possible that the elements\nimmediately following these and representing them might show a higher\ndegree of intensity, without, however, for that reason constituting the\ncentre of the dream representation. This expectation is also destroyed\nby a comparison of the dream and the dream material. The intensity of\nthe elements in the one has nothing to do with the intensity of the\nelements in the other; a complete \u201ctransvaluation of all psychic values\u201d\ntakes place between the dream-material and the dream. The very element\nwhich is transient and hazy and which is pushed into the background by\nmore vigorous images is often the single and only element in which may\nbe traced any direct derivative from the subject which entirely\ndominated the dream-thoughts.\nThe intensity of the elements of the dream shows itself to be determined\nin a different manner\u2014that is, by two factors which are independent of\neach other. It is easy to see at the outset that those elements by means\nof which the wish-fulfilment is expressed are most distinctly\nrepresented. But then analysis also teaches us that from the most vivid\nelements of the dream, the greatest number of trains of thought start,\nand that the most vivid are at the same time those which are best\ndetermined. No change of sense is involved if we express the latter\nempirical thesis in the following form: the greatest intensity is shown\nby those elements of the dream for which the most abundant condensation\nactivity was required. We may therefore expect that this condition and\nthe others imposed by the wish-fulfilment can be expressed in a single\nformula.\nThe problem which I have just been considering\u2014the causes of greater or\nless intensity or distinctness of individual elements of the dream\u2014is\none which I should like to guard against being confused with another\nproblem, which has to do with the varying distinctness of whole dreams\nor sections of dreams. In the first case, the opposite of distinctness\nis blurredness; in the second, confusion. It is of course unmistakable\nthat the intensities rise and fall in the two scales in unison. A\nportion of the dream which seems clear to us usually contains vivid\nelements; an obscure dream is composed of less intense elements. But the\nproblem with which we are confronted by the scale, ranging from the\napparently clear to the indistinct or confused, is far more complicated\nthan that formed by variations in the vividness of the dream elements;\nindeed the former will be dropped from the discussion for reasons which\nwill be given later. In isolated cases we are astonished to find that\nthe impression of clearness or indistinctness produced by the dream is\naltogether without significance for its structure, and that it\noriginates in the dream material as one of its constituents. Thus I\nremember a dream which seemed particularly well constructed, flawless,\nand clear, so that I made up my mind, while I was still in the somnolent\nstate, to recognise a new class of dreams\u2014those which had not been\nsubject to the mechanism of condensation and displacement, and which\nmight thus be designated \u201cFancies while asleep.\u201d A closer examination\nproved that this rare dream had the same breaches and flaws in its\nconstruction as every other; for this reason I abandoned the category of\ndream fancies. The content of the dream, reduced to its lowest terms,\nwas that I was reciting to a friend a difficult and long-sought theory\nof bisexuality, and the wish-fulfilling power of the dream was\nresponsible for the fact that this theory (which, by the way, was not\nstated in the dream) appeared so clear and flawless. What I considered a\njudgment upon the finished dream was thus a part of the dream content,\nand the essential one at that. The dream activity had extended its\noperations, as it were, into waking thought, and had presented to me in\nthe form of a judgment that part of the dream material which it had not\nsucceeded in reproducing with exactness. The exact opposite of this once\ncame to my attention in the case of a female patient who was at first\naltogether unwilling to tell a dream which was necessary for the\nanalysis, \u201cbecause it was so obscure and confused,\u201d and who declared,\nafter repeatedly denying the accuracy of her description, that several\npersons, herself, her husband, and her father, had occurred in the\ndream, and that it seemed as though she did not know whether her husband\nwas her father, or who her father was anyway, or something of that sort.\nUpon considering this dream in connection with the ideas that occurred\nto the dreamer in the course of the sitting, it was found unquestionably\nto be concerned with the story of a servant girl who had to confess that\nshe was expecting a child, and who was now confronted with doubts as to\n\u201cwho was really the father.\u201d[DX] The obscurity manifested by the dream,\ntherefore, is again in this case a portion of the material which excited\nit. A part of this material was represented in the form of the dream.\nThe form of the dream or of dreaming is used with astonishing frequency\nto represent the concealed content.\nComments on the dream and seemingly harmless observations about it often\nserve in the most subtle manner to conceal\u2014although they usually\nbetray\u2014a part of what is dreamed. Thus, for example, when the dreamer\nsays: _Here the dream is vague_, and the analysis gives an infantile\nreminiscence of listening to a person cleaning himself after defecation.\nAnother example deserves to be recorded in detail. A young man has a\nvery distinct dream which recalls to him phantasies from his infancy\nwhich have remained conscious to him: he was in a summer hotel one\nevening, he mistook the number of his room, and entered a room in which\nan elderly lady and her two daughters were undressing to go to bed. He\ncontinues: \u201c_Then there are some gaps in the dream; then something is\nmissing_; and at the end there was a man in the room who wished to throw\nme out with whom I had to wrestle.\u201d He endeavoured in vain to recall the\ncontent and purpose of the boyish fancy to which the dream apparently\nalludes. But we finally become aware that the required content had\nalready been given in his utterances concerning the indistinct part of\nthe dream. The \u201cgaps\u201d were the openings in the genitals of the women who\nwere retiring: \u201cHere something is missing\u201d described the chief character\nof the female genitals. In those early years he burned with curiosity to\nsee a female genital, and was still inclined to adhere to the infantile\nsexual theory which attributes a male genital to the woman.\nAll the dreams which have been dreamed in the same night belong to the\nsame whole when considered with respect to their content; their\nseparation into several portions, their grouping and number, all these\ndetails are full of meaning, and may be considered as information coming\nfrom the latent dream content. In the interpretation of dreams\nconsisting of many principal sections, or of dreams belonging to the\nsame night, one must not fail to think of the possibility that these\ndifferent and succeeding dreams bring to expression the same feelings in\ndifferent material. The one that comes first in time of these homologous\ndreams is usually the most disfigured and most bashful, while the\nsucceeding is bolder and more distinct.\nEven Pharaoh\u2019s dream in the Bible of the ears and the kine, which Joseph\ninterpreted, was of this kind. It is reported by Josephus (_Antiquities\nof the Jews_, bk. ii. chap, iii.) in greater detail than in the Bible.\nAfter relating the first dream, the King said: \u201cWhen I had seen this\nvision I awaked out of my sleep, and being in disorder, and considering\nwith myself what this appearance should be, I fell asleep again, and saw\nanother dream much more wonderful than the first, which did still more\naffright and disturb me.\u201d After listening to the report of the dream,\nJoseph said, \u201cThis dream, O King, although seen under two forms,\nsignifies one and the same issue of things.\u201d\nJung,[99] who, in his _Beitrag zur Psychologie des Ger\u00fcchtes_ relates\nhow the veiled erotic dream of a school-girl was understood by her\nfriends without interpretation and continued by them with variations,\nremarks in connection with reports of this dream, \u201cthat the last of a\nlong series of dream pictures contained precisely the same thought whose\nrepresentation had been attempted in the first picture of the series.\nThe censor pushed the complex out of the way as long as possible,\nthrough constantly renewed symbolic concealments, displacements,\ndeviations into the harmless, &c.\u201d (_l.c._ p. 87). Scherner[58] was well\nacquainted with the peculiarities of dream disfigurement and describes\nthem at the end of his theory of organic stimulation as a special law,\np. 166: \u201cBut, finally, the phantasy observes the general law in all\nnerve stimuli emanating from symbolic dream formations, by representing\nat the beginning of the dream only the remotest and freest allusions to\nthe stimulating object; but towards the end, when the power of\nrepresentation becomes exhausted, it presents the stimulus or its\nconcerned organ or its function in unconcealed form, and in the way this\ndream designates its organic motive and reaches its end.\u201d\nA new confirmation of Scherner\u2019s law has been furnished by Otto\nRank[106] in his work, _A Self Interpretation Dream_. This dream of a\ngirl reported by him consisted of two dreams, separated in time of the\nsame night, the second of which ended with pollution. This pollution\ndream could be interpreted in all its details by disregarding a great\nmany of the ideas contributed by the dreamer, and the profuse relations\nbetween the two dream contents indicated that the first dream expressed\nin bashful language the same thing as the second, so that the latter\u2014the\npollution dream\u2014helped to a full explanation of the former. From this\nexample, Rank, with perfect justice, draws conclusions concerning the\nsignificance of pollution dreams in general.\nBut in my experience it is only in rare cases that one is in a position\nto interpret clearness or confusion in the dream as certainty or doubt\nin the dream material. Later I shall try to discover the factor in the\nformation of dreams upon whose influence this scale of qualities\nessentially depends.\nIn some dreams, which adhere for a time to a certain situation and\nscenery, there occur interruptions described in the following words:\n\u201cBut then it seemed as though it were at the same time another place,\nand there such and such a thing happened.\u201d What thus interrupts the main\ntrend of the dream, which after a while may be continued again, turns\nout to be a subordinate idea, an interpolated thought in the dream\nmaterial. A conditional relation in the dream-thoughts is represented by\nsimultaneousness in the dream (wenn\u2014wann; if\u2014when).\nWhat is signified by the sensation of impeded movement, which so often\noccurs in the dream, and which is so closely allied to anxiety? One\nwants to move, and is unable to stir from the spot; or one wants to\naccomplish something, and meets one obstacle after another. The train is\nabout to start, and one cannot reach it; one\u2019s hand is raised to avenge\nan insult, and its strength fails, &c. We have already encountered this\nsensation in exhibition dreams, but have as yet made no serious attempt\nto interpret it. It is convenient, but inadequate, to answer that there\nis motor paralysis in sleep, which manifests itself by means of the\nsensation alluded to. We may ask: \u201cWhy is it, then, that we do not dream\ncontinually of these impeded motions?\u201d And we are justified in supposing\nthat this sensation, constantly appearing in sleep, serves some purpose\nor other in representation, and is brought about by a need occurring in\nthe dream material for this sort of representation.\nFailure to accomplish does not always appear in the dream as a\nsensation, but also simply as a part of the dream content. I believe\nthat a case of this sort is particularly well suited to enlighten us\nabout the significance of this characteristic of the dream. I shall give\nan abridged report of a dream in which I seem to be accused of\ndishonesty. _The scene is a mixture, consisting of a private sanatorium\nand several other buildings. A lackey appears to call me to an\nexamination. I know in the dream that something has been missed, and\nthat the examination is taking place because I am suspected of having\nappropriated the lost article. Analysis shows that examination is to be\ntaken in two senses, and also means medical examination. Being conscious\nof my innocence, and of the fact that I have been called in for\nconsultation, I calmly follow the lackey. We are received at the door by\nanother lackey, who says, pointing to me, \u201cIs that the person whom you\nhave brought? Why, he is a respectable man.\u201d Thereupon, without any\nlackey, I enter a great hall in which machines are standing, and which\nreminds me of an Inferno with its hellish modes of punishment. I see a\ncolleague strapped on to one apparatus who has every reason to be\nconcerned about me; but he takes no notice of me. Then I am given to\nunderstand that I may now go. Then I cannot find my hat, and cannot go\nafter all._\nThe wish which the dream fulfils is obviously that I may be acknowledged\nto be an honest man, and may go; all kinds of subject-matter containing\na contradiction of this idea must therefore be present in the\ndream-thoughts. The fact that I may go is the sign of my absolution; if,\nthen, the dream furnishes at its close an event which prevents me from\ngoing, we may readily conclude that the suppressed subject-matter of the\ncontradiction asserts itself in this feature. The circumstance that I\ncannot find my hat therefore means: \u201cYou are not an honest man after\nall.\u201d Failure to accomplish in the dream is the expression of a\ncontradiction, a \u201cNo\u201d; and therefore the earlier assertion, to the\neffect that the dream is not capable of expressing a negation, must be\nrevised accordingly.[DY]\nIn other dreams which involve failure to accomplish a thing not only as\na situation but also as a sensation, the same contradiction is more\nemphatically expressed in the form of a volition, to which a counter\nvolition opposes itself. Thus the sensation of impeded motion represents\na _conflict of will_. We shall hear later that this very motor paralysis\nbelongs to the fundamental conditions of the psychic process in\ndreaming. Now the impulse which is transferred to motor channels is\nnothing else than the will, and the fact that we are sure to find this\nimpulse impeded in the dream makes the whole process extraordinarily\nwell suited to represent volition and the \u201cNo\u201d which opposes itself\nthereto. From my explanation of anxiety, it is easy to understand why\nthe sensation of thwarted will is so closely allied to anxiety, and why\nit is so often connected with it in the dream. Anxiety is a libidinous\nimpulse which emanates from the unconscious, and is inhibited by the\nforeconscious. Therefore, when a sensation of inhibition in the dream is\naccompanied by anxiety, there must also be present a volition which has\nat one time been capable of arousing a _libido_; there must be a sexual\nimpulse.\nWhat significance and what psychic force is to be ascribed to such\nmanifestations of judgment as \u201cFor that is only a dream,\u201d which\nfrequently comes to the surface in dreams, I shall discuss in another\nplace (_vide infra_, p. 390). For the present I shall merely say that\nthey serve to depreciate the value of the thing dreamed. An interesting\nproblem allied to this, namely, the meaning of the fact that sometimes a\ncertain content is designated in the dream itself as \u201cdreamed\u201d\u2014the\nriddle of the \u201cdream within the dream\u201d\u2014has been solved in a similar\nsense by W. Stekel[114] through the analysis of some convincing\nexamples. The part of the dream \u201cdreamed\u201d is again to be depreciated in\nvalue and robbed of its reality; that which the dreamer continues to\ndream after awakening from the dream within the dream, is what the\ndream-wish desires to put in place of the extinguished reality. It may\ntherefore be assumed that the part \u201cdreamed\u201d contains the representation\nof the reality and the real reminiscence, while, on the other hand, the\ncontinued dream contains the representation of what the dreamer wished.\nThe inclusion of a certain content in a \u201cdream within the dream\u201d is\ntherefore equivalent to the wish that what has just been designated as a\ndream should not have occurred. The dream-work utilises the dream itself\nas a form of deflection.\n(_d_) _Regard for Presentability_\nSo far we have been attempting to ascertain how the dream represents the\nrelations among the dream-thoughts, but we have several times extended\nour consideration to the further question of what alterations the dream\nmaterial undergoes for the purposes of dream formation. We now know that\nthe dream material, after being stripped of the greater parts of its\nrelations, is subjected to compression, while at the same time\ndisplacements of intensity among its elements force a psychic\nrevaluation of this material. The displacements which we have considered\nwere shown to be substitutions of one idea for another, the substitute\nbeing in some way connected with the original by associations, and the\ndisplacements were put to the service of condensation by virtue of the\nfact that in this manner a common mean between two elements took the\nplace of these two elements in the formation of the dream. We have not\nyet mentioned any other kind of displacement. But we learn from the\nanalyses that another exists, and that it manifests itself in a change\nof the verbal expression employed for the thought in question. In both\ncases we have displacement following a chain of associations, but the\nsame process takes place in different psychic spheres, and the result of\nthis displacement in the one case is that one element is substituted for\nanother, while in the other case an element exchanges its verbal\nexpression for another.\nThis second kind of displacement occurring in dream formation not only\npossesses great theoretical interest, but is also peculiarly well fitted\nto explain the semblance of phantastic absurdity in which the dream\ndisguises itself. Displacement usually occurs in such a way that a\ncolourless and abstract expression in the dream-thought is exchanged for\none that is visual and concrete. The advantage, and consequently the\npurpose, of this substitution is obvious. Whatever is visual is _capable\nof representation_ in the dream, and can be wrought into situations\nwhere the abstract expression would confront dream representation with\ndifficulties similar to those which would arise if a political editorial\nwere to be represented in an illustrated journal. But not only the\npossibility of representation, but also the interests of condensation\nand of the censor, can be furthered by this change. If the abstractly\nexpressed and unwieldy dream-thought is recast into figurative language,\nthis new expression and the rest of the dream material are more easily\nfurnished with those identities and cross references, which are\nessential to the dream activity and which it creates whenever they are\nnot at hand, for the reason that in every language concrete terms, owing\nto their evolution, are more abundant in associations than conceptual\nones. It may be imagined that in dream formation a good part of the\nintermediary activity, which tries to reduce the separate dream-thoughts\nto the tersest and simplest possible expression in the dream, takes\nplace in the manner above described\u2014that is to say, in providing\nsuitable paraphrase for the individual thoughts. One thought whose\nexpression has already been determined on other grounds will thus exert\na separating and selective influence upon the means available for\nexpressing the other, and perhaps it will do this constantly throughout,\nsomewhat after the manner of the poet. If a poem in rhyme is to be\ncomposed, the second rhyming line is bound by two conditions; it must\nexpress the proper meaning, and it must express it in such a way as to\nsecure the rhyme. The best poems are probably those in which the poet\u2019s\neffort to find a rhyme is unconscious, and in which both thoughts have\nfrom the beginning exercised a mutual influence in the selection of\ntheir verbal expressions, which can then be made to rhyme by a means of\nslight remodification.\nIn some cases change of expression serves the purposes of dream\ncondensation more directly, in making possible the invention of a verbal\nconstruction which is ambiguous and therefore suited to the expression\nof more than one dream-thought. The whole range of word-play is thus put\nat the service of the dream activity. The part played by words in the\nformation of dreams ought not to surprise us. A word being a point of\njunction for a number of conceptions, it possesses, so to speak, a\npredestined ambiguity, and neuroses (obsessions, phobias) take advantage\nof the conveniences which words offer for the purposes of condensation\nand disguise quite as readily as the dream.[DZ] That dream conception\nalso profits by this displacement of expression is easily demonstrated.\nIt is naturally confusing if an ambiguous word is put in the place of\ntwo ambiguous ones; and the employment of a figurative expression\ninstead of the sober everyday one thwarts our understanding, especially\nsince the dream never tells us whether the elements which it shows are\nto be interpreted literally or figuratively, or whether they refer to\nthe dream material directly or only through the agency of interpolated\nforms of speech.[EA] Several examples of representations in the dream\nwhich are held together only by ambiguity have already been cited (\u201cher\nmouth opens without difficulty,\u201d in the dream of Irma\u2019s injection; \u201cI\ncannot go yet,\u201d in the last dream reported, p. 312), &c. I shall now\ncite a dream in the analysis of which the figurative expression of\nabstract thought plays a greater part. The difference between such dream\ninterpretation and interpretation by symbolism may again be sharply\ndistinguished; in the symbolic interpretation of dreams the key to the\nsymbolism is arbitrarily chosen by the interpreter, while in our own\ncases of verbal disguise all these keys are universally known and are\ntaken from established customs of speech. If the correct notion occurs\nat the right opportunity, it is possible to solve dreams of this sort\ncompletely or in part, independently of any statements made by the\ndreamer.\nA lady, a friend of mine, dreams: _She is in the opera-house. It is a\nWagnerian performance which has lasted till 7.45 in the morning. In the\nparquette and parterre there are tables, around which people dine and\ndrink. Her cousin and his young wife, who have just returned from their\nhoneymoon, sit next to her at one of these tables, and next to them sits\none of the aristocracy. Concerning the latter the idea is that the young\nwife has brought him back with her from the wedding journey. It is quite\nabove board, just as if she were bringing back a hat from her trip. In\nthe midst of the parquette there is a high tower, on the top of which is\na platform surrounded by an iron grating. There, high up, stands the\nconductor with the features of Hans Richter; he is continually running\naround behind the grating, perspiring awfully, and from this position\nconducting the orchestra, which is arranged around the base of the\ntower. She herself sits in a box with a lady friend (known to me). Her\nyoungest sister tries to hand her from the parquette a big piece of coal\nwith the idea that she did not know that it would last so long and that\nshe must by this time be terribly cold. (It was a little as if the boxes\nhad to be heated during the long performance.)_\nThe dream is senseless enough, though the situation is well developed\ntoo\u2014the tower in the midst of the parquette from which the conductor\nleads the orchestra; but, above all, the coal which her sister hands\nher! I purposely asked for no analysis of this dream. With the knowledge\nI have of the personal relations of the dreamer, I was able to interpret\nparts of it independently. I knew that she had entertained warm feelings\nfor a musician whose career had been prematurely blasted by insanity. I\ntherefore decided to take the tower in the parquette verbally. It was\napparent, then, that the man whom she wished to see in the place of Hans\nRichter _towered_ above all the other members of the orchestra. This\ntower must, therefore, be designated as a composite picture formed by an\napposition; with its pedestal it represents the greatness of the man,\nbut with its gratings on top, behind which he runs around like a\nprisoner or an animal in a cage (an allusion to the name of the\nunfortunate man), it represents his later fate. \u201cLunatic-tower\u201d is\nperhaps the word in which both thoughts might have met.\nNow that we have discovered the dream\u2019s method of representation, we may\ntry with the same key to open the second apparent absurdity,\u2014that of the\ncoal which her sister hands her. \u201cCoal\u201d must mean \u201csecret love.\u201d\n\u201cNo _coal_, no _fire_ so hotly glows\nAs the _secret love_ which no one knows.\u201d\nShe and her friend remain seated while her younger sister, who still has\nopportunities to marry, hands her up the coal \u201cbecause she did not know\nit would last so long.\u201d What would last so long is not told in the\ndream. In relating it we would supply \u201cthe performance\u201d; but in the\ndream we must take the sentence as it is, declare it ambiguous, and add\n\u201cuntil she marries.\u201d The interpretation \u201csecret love\u201d is then confirmed\nby the mention of the cousin who sits with his wife in the parquette,\nand by the open love-affair attributed to the latter. The contrasts\nbetween secret and open love, between her fire and the coldness of the\nyoung wife, dominate the dream. Moreover, here again there is a person\n\u201cin high position\u201d as a middle term between the aristocrat and the\nmusician entitled to high hopes.\nBy means of the above discussion we have at last brought to light a\nthird factor, whose part in the transformation of the dream thoughts\ninto the dream content is not to be considered trivial; _it is the\nregard for presentability_ (_German: Darstellbarkeit_) _in the peculiar\npsychic material which the dream makes use of_,\u2014that is fitness for\nrepresentation, for the most part by means of visual images. Among the\nvarious subordinate ideas associated with the essential dream thoughts,\nthat one will be preferred which permits of a visual representation, and\nthe dream-activity does not hesitate promptly to recast the inflexible\nthought into another verbal form, even if it is the more unusual one, as\nlong as this form makes dramatisation possible, and thus puts an end to\nthe psychological distress caused by cramped thinking. This pouring of\nthe thought content into another mould may at the same time be put at\nthe service of the condensation work, and may establish relations with\nanother thought which would otherwise not be present. This other thought\nitself may perhaps have previously changed its original expression for\nthe purpose of meeting these relations half-way.\nIn view of the part played by puns, quotations, songs, and proverbs in\nthe intellectual life of educated persons, it would be entirely in\naccordance with our expectation to find disguises of this sort used with\nextraordinary frequency. For a few kinds of material a universally\napplicable dream symbolism has been established on a basis of generally\nknown allusions and equivalents. A good part of this symbolism,\nmoreover, is possessed by the dream in common with the psychoneuroses,\nand with legends and popular customs.\nIndeed, if we look more closely, we must recognise that in employing\nthis method of substitution the dream is generally doing nothing\noriginal. For the attainment of its purpose, which in this case is the\npossibility of dramatisation without interference from the censor, it\nsimply follows the paths which it finds already marked out in\nunconscious thought, and gives preference to those transformations of\nthe suppressed material which may become conscious also in the form of\nwit and allusion, and with which all the fancies of neurotics are\nfilled. Here all at once we come to understand Scherner\u2019s method of\ndream interpretation, the essential truth of which I have defended\nelsewhere. The occupation of one\u2019s fancy with one\u2019s own body is by no\nmeans peculiar to, or characteristic of the dream alone. My analyses\nhave shown me that this is a regular occurrence in the unconscious\nthought of neurotics, and goes back to sexual curiosity, the object of\nwhich for the adolescent youth or maiden is found in the genitals of the\nopposite sex, or even of the same sex. But, as Scherner and Volkelt very\nappropriately declare, the house is not the only group of ideas which is\nused for the symbolisation of the body\u2014either in the dream or in the\nunconscious fancies of the neurosis. I know some patients, to be sure,\nwho have steadily adhered to an architectural symbolism for the body and\nthe genitals (sexual interest certainly extends far beyond the region of\nthe external genital organs), to whom posts and pillars signify legs (as\nin the \u201cSong of Songs\u201d), to whom every gate suggests a bodily opening\n(\u201chole\u201d), and every water-main a urinary apparatus, and the like. But\nthe group of associations belonging to plant life and to the kitchen is\njust as eagerly chosen to conceal sexual images; in the first case the\nusage of speech, the result of phantastic comparisons dating from the\nmost ancient times, has made abundant preparation (the \u201cvineyard\u201d of the\nLord, the \u201cseeds,\u201d the \u201cgarden\u201d of the girl in the \u201cSong of Songs\u201d). The\nugliest as well as the most intimate details of sexual life may be\ndreamed about in apparently harmless allusions to culinary operations,\nand the symptoms of hysteria become practically unintelligible if we\nforget that sexual symbolism can conceal itself behind the most\ncommonplace and most inconspicuous matters, as its best hiding-place.\nThe fact that some neurotic children cannot look at blood and raw meat,\nthat they vomit at the sight of eggs and noodles, and that the dread of\nsnakes, which is natural to mankind, is monstrously exaggerated in\nneurotics, all of this has a definite sexual meaning. Wherever the\nneurosis employs a disguise of this sort, it treads the paths once\ntrodden by the whole of humanity in the early ages of civilisation\u2014paths\nof whose existence customs of speech, superstitions, and morals still\ngive testimony to this day.\nI here insert the promised flower dream of a lady patient, in which I\nhave italicised everything which is to be sexually interpreted. This\nbeautiful dream seemed to lose its entire charm for the dreamer after it\nhad been interpreted.\n(_a_) Preliminary dream: _She goes to the two maids in the kitchen and\nscolds them for taking so long to prepare \u201ca little bite of food.\u201d She\nalso sees a great many coarse dishes standing in the kitchen inverted so\nthat the water may drip off them, and heaped up in a pile._ Later\naddition: _The two maids go to fetch water, and must, as it were, step\ninto a river which reaches up into the house or into the yard._[EB]\n(_b_) Main dream[EC]: _She is descending from a high place[ED] over\nbalustrades that are curiously fashioned or fences which are united into\nbig squares and consist of a conglomeration of little squares.[EE] It is\nreally not intended for climbing upon; she is worried about finding a\nplace for her foot, and she is glad her dress doesn\u2019t get caught\nanywhere, and that she remains so respectable while she is going.[EF]\nShe is also carrying a large bough in her hand,[EG] really a bough of a\ntree, which is thickly studded with red blossoms; it has many branches,\nand spreads out.[EH] With this is connected the idea of cherry blossoms,\nbut they look like full-bloom camelias, which of course do not grow on\ntrees. While she is descending, she first has one, then suddenly two,\nand later again only one.[EI] When she arrives at the bottom of the\nlower blossoms they have already fallen off to a considerable extent.\nNow that she is at the bottom, she sees a porter who is combing\u2014as she\nwould like to express it\u2014just such a tree\u2014that is, who is plucking thick\nbunches of hair from it, which hang from it like moss. Other workmen\nhave chopped off such boughs in a garden, and have thrown them upon the\nstreet, where they lie about, so that many people take some of them. But\nshe asks whether that is right, whether anybody may take one.[EJ] In the\ngarden there stands a young man_ (having a personality with which she is\nacquainted, not a member of her family) _up to whom she goes in order to\nask him how it is possible to transplant such boughs into her own\ngarden.[EK] He embraces her, whereat she resists and asks him what he\nmeans, whether it is permissible to embrace her in such a manner. He\nsays that there is no wrong in it, that it is permitted.[EL] He then\ndeclares himself willing to go with her into the other garden, in order\nto show her the transplanting, and he says something to her which she\ndoes not correctly understand: \u201cBesides this three metres_\u2014(later on she\nsays: square metres) _or three fathoms of ground are lacking.\u201d It seems\nas though the man were trying to ask her something in return for his\naffability, as though he had the intention of indemnifying himself in\nher garden, as though he wanted to evade some law or other, to derive\nsome advantage from it without causing her an injury. She does not know\nwhether or not he really shows her anything._[EM]\nI must mention still another series of associations which often serves\nthe purpose of concealing sexual meaning both in dreams and in the\nneurosis,\u2014I refer to the change of residence series. To change one\u2019s\nresidence is readily replaced by \u201cto remove,\u201d an ambiguous expression\nwhich may have reference to clothing. If the dream also contains a\n\u201clift\u201d (elevator), one may think of the verb \u201cto lift,\u201d hence of lifting\nup the clothing.\nI have naturally an abundance of such material, but a report of it would\ncarry us too far into the discussion of neurotic conditions. Everything\nleads to the same conclusion, that no special symbolising activity of\nthe mind in the formation of dreams need be assumed; that, on the\ncontrary, the dream makes use of such symbolisations as are to be found\nready-made in unconscious thought, because these better satisfy the\nrequirements of dream formation, on account of their dramatic fitness,\nand particularly on account of their exemption from the censor.\n(_e_) _Examples\u2014Arithmetic Speeches in the Dream_\nBefore I proceed to assign to its proper place the fourth of the factors\nwhich control the formation of the dream, I shall cite several examples\nfrom my collection of dreams for the purpose partly of illustrating the\nco-operation of the three factors with which we are acquainted, and\npartly of supplying proof for assertions which have been made without\ndemonstration or of drawing irrefutable inferences from them. For it has\nbeen very difficult for me in the foregoing account of the dream\nactivity to demonstrate my conclusions by means of examples. Examples\nfor the individual thesis are convincing only when considered in\nconnection with a dream interpretation; when they are torn from their\ncontext they lose their significance, and, furthermore, a dream\ninterpretation, though not at all profound, soon becomes so extensive\nthat it obscures the thread of the discussion which it is intended to\nillustrate. This technical motive may excuse me for now mixing together\nall sorts of things which have nothing in common but their relation to\nthe text of the foregoing chapter.\nWe shall first consider a few examples of very peculiar or unusual\nmethods of representation in the dream. The dream of a lady is as\nfollows: _A servant girl is standing on a ladder as though to clean the\nwindows, and has with her a chimpanzee and a gorilla cat_ (later\ncorrected\u2014angora cat). _She throws the animals at the dreamer; the\nchimpanzee cuddles up to her, and this is disgusting to her._ This dream\nhas accomplished its purpose by the simplest possible means, namely by\ntaking a mere mode of speech literally and representing it according to\nthe meaning of its words. \u201cApe,\u201d like the names of animals in general,\nis an epithet of opprobrium, and the situation of the dream means\nnothing but \u201c_to hurl invectives_.\u201d This same collection will soon\nfurnish us with further examples of the use of this simple artifice.\nAnother dream proceeds in a very similar manner: _A woman with a child\nthat has a conspicuously deformed cranium; the dreamer has heard that\nthe child got into this condition owing to its position in its mother\u2019s\nwomb. The doctor says that the cranium might be given a better shape by\nmeans of compression, but that would harm the brain. She thinks that\nbecause it is a boy it won\u2019t suffer so much from deformity._ This dream\ncontains a plastic representation of the concept: \u201c_Childish\nimpressions_,\u201d which the dreamer has heard of in the course of\nexplanations concerning the treatment.\nIn the following example, the dream activity enters upon a different\npath. The dream contains a recollection of an excursion to the\nHilmteich, near Graz: _There is a terrible storm outside; a miserable\nhotel\u2014the water is dripping from the walls, and the beds are damp._ (The\nlatter part of the content is less directly expressed than I give it.)\nThe dream signifies \u201c_superfluous_.\u201d The abstract idea occurring in the\ndream thoughts is first made equivocal by a certain straining of\nlanguage; it has, perhaps, been replaced by \u201coverflowing\u201d or by \u201cfluid\u201d\nand \u201csuper-fluid (-fluous)\u201d and has then been given representation by an\naccumulation of like impressions. Water within, water without, water in\nthe beds in the form of dampness\u2014everything fluid and \u201csuper\u201d fluid.\nThat, for the purposes of the dream representation, the spelling is much\nless regarded than the sound of words ought not surprise us when we\nremember that rhyme exercises similar privileges.\nThe fact that language has at its disposal a great number of words which\nwere originally intended in a picturesque and concrete sense but are at\npresent used in a faded abstract sense has in other cases made it very\neasy for the dream to represent its thoughts. The dream need only\nrestore to these words their full significance, or follow the evolution\nof their meaning a little way back. For example, a man dreams that his\nfriend, who is struggling to get out of a very tight place, calls upon\nhim to help him. The analysis shows that the tight place is a hole, and\nthat the dream uses symbolically his very words to his friend, \u201cBe\ncareful, or you\u2019ll get yourself into a hole.\u201d[EN] Another dreamer climbs\nupon a mountain from which he sees a very extraordinary broad view. He\nidentifies himself with his brother who is editing a \u201creview\u201d which\ndeals with relations to the Farthest East.\nIt would be a separate undertaking to collect such methods of\nrepresentation and to arrange them according to the principles upon\nwhich they are based. Some of the representations are quite witty. They\ngive the impression that they would have never been divined if the\ndreamer himself had not reported them.\n1. A man dreams that he is asked for a name, which, however, he cannot\nrecall. He himself explains that this means: _It does not occur to me in\nthe dream._\n2. A female patient relates a dream in which all the persons concerned\nwere especially big. \u201cThat means,\u201d she adds, \u201cthat it must deal with an\nepisode of my early childhood, for at that time all grown up people\nnaturally seemed to me immensely big.\u201d\nThe transference into childhood is also expressed differently in other\ndreams by translating time into space. One sees the persons and scenes\nin question as if at a great distance, at the end of a long road, or as\nif looked at through the wrong end of the opera-glass.\n3. A man, who in waking life shows an inclination to abstract and\nindefinite expressions, but who is otherwise endowed with wit enough,\ndreams in a certain connection that he is at a railroad station while a\ntrain is coming in. But then the station platform approaches the train,\nwhich stands still; hence an absurd inversion of the real state of\naffairs. This detail is again nothing but an index to remind one that\nsomething else in the dream should be turned about. The analysis of the\nsame dream brings back the recollection of a picture-book in which men\nare represented standing on their heads and walking on their hands.\n4. The same dreamer on another occasion relates a short dream which\nalmost recalls the technique of a rebus. His uncle gives him a kiss in\nan automobile. He immediately adds the interpretation, which I should\nnever have found: it means _Autoerotism_. This might have been made as a\njoke in the waking state.\nThe dream work often succeeds in representing very awkward material,\nsuch as proper names, by means of the forced utilisation of very\nfar-fetched references. In one of my dreams the elder Bruecke _has given\nme a task. I compound a preparation, and skim something from it which\nlooks like crumpled tinfoil._ (More of this later on.) The notion\ncorresponding to this, which was not easy to find, is \u201cstanniol,\u201d and\nnow I know that I have in mind the name of the author Stannius, which\nwas borne by a treatise on the nervous system of fishes, which I\nregarded with awe in my youthful years. The first scientific task which\nmy teacher gave me was actually concerned with the nervous system of a\nfish\u2014the _Ammoc\u0153tes_. Obviously the latter name could never have been\nused in a picture puzzle.\nI shall not omit here to insert a dream having a curious content, which\nis also remarkable as a child\u2019s dream, and which is very easily\nexplained by the analysis. A lady relates: \u201cI can remember that when I\nwas a child I repeatedly dreamed, that the _dear Lord had a pointed\npaper hat on his head_. They used to make me wear such a hat at table\nvery often, so that I might not be able to look at the plates of the\nother children and see how much they had received of a particular dish.\nSince I have learned that God is omniscient, the dream signifies that I\nknow everything in spite of the hat which I am made to wear.\u201d\nWherein the dream work consists, and how it manages its material, the\ndream thoughts, can be shown in a very instructive manner from the\nnumbers and calculations which occur in dreams. Moreover, numbers in\ndreams are regarded as of especial significance by superstition. I shall\ntherefore give a few more examples of this kind from my own collection.\n1. The following is taken from the dream of a lady shortly before the\nclose of her treatment:\nShe wants to pay for something or other; her daughter takes 3 florins\nand 65 kreuzer from her pocket-book; but the mother says: \u201cWhat are you\ndoing? It only costs 21 kreuzer.\u201d This bit of dream was immediately\nintelligible to me without further explanation from my knowledge of the\ndreamer\u2019s circumstances. The lady was a foreigner who had provided for\nher daughter in an educational institution in Vienna, and who could\ncontinue my treatment as long as her daughter stayed in the city. In\nthree weeks the daughter\u2019s school year was to end, and with that the\ntreatment also stopped. On the day before the dream the principal of the\ninstitute had urged her to make up her mind to allow her child to remain\nwith her for another year. She had then obviously worked out this\nsuggestion to the conclusion that in this case she would be able to\ncontinue the treatment for one year more. Now, this is what the dream\nrefers to, for a year is equal to 365 days; the three weeks that remain\nbefore the close of the school year and of the treatment are equivalent\nto 21 days (though the hours of treatment are not as many as that). The\nnumerals, which in the dream thoughts referred to time, are given money\nvalues in the dream, not without also giving expression to a deeper\nmeaning for \u201ctime is money.\u201d 365 kreuzer, to be sure, are _3 florins and\n65 kreuzer_. The smallness of the sums which appear in the dream is a\nself-evident wish-fulfilment; the wish has reduced the cost of both the\ntreatment and the year\u2019s instruction at the institution.\nII. The numerals in another dream involve more complicated relations. A\nyoung lady, who, however, has already been married a number of years,\nlearns that an acquaintance of hers of about her own age, Elsie L., has\njust become engaged. Thereupon she dreams: _She is sitting in the\ntheatre with her husband, and one side of the orchestra is quite\nunoccupied. Her husband tells her that Elsie L. and her husband had also\nwanted to go, but that they had been able to get nothing but poor seats,\nthree for 1 florin and 50 kreuzer, and of course they could not take\nthose. She thinks that they didn\u2019t lose much either._\nWhere do the _1 florin and 50 kreuzer_ come from? From an occurrence of\nthe previous day which is really indifferent. The dreamer\u2019s\nsister-in-law had received 150 florins as a present from her husband,\nand had quickly got rid of them by buying some jewelry. Let us note that\n150 florins is 100 times more than 1 florin and 50 kreuzer. Whence the 3\nwhich stands before the theatre seats? There is only one association for\nthis, namely, that the bride is that many months\u2014three\u2014younger than\nherself. Information concerning the significance of the feature that one\nside of the orchestra remains empty leads to the solution of the dream.\nThis feature is an undisguised allusion to a little occurrence which has\ngiven her husband good cause for teasing her. She had decided to go to\nthe theatre during the week, and had been careful to get tickets a few\ndays before, for which she had to pay the pre-emption charge. When they\ngot to the theatre they found that one side of the house was almost\nempty; she certainly did not need _to be in such a hurry_.\nI shall now substitute the dream thoughts for the dream: \u201cIt surely was\nnonsense to marry so early; there was _no need for my being in such a\nhurry_. From the case of Elsie L., I see that I should have got a\nhusband just the same\u2014and one who is a _hundred times_ better (husband,\nsweetheart, treasure)\u2014if I had only _waited_ (antithesis to the haste of\nher sister-in-law). I could have bought _three_ such men for the money\n(the dowry!). Our attention is drawn to the fact that the numerals in\nthis dream have changed their meanings and relations to a much greater\nextent than in the one previously considered. The transforming and\ndisfiguring activity of the dream has in this case been greater, a fact\nwhich we interpret as meaning that these dream thoughts had to overcome\na particularly great amount of inner psychic resistance up to the point\nof their representation. We must also not overlook the circumstance that\nthe dream contains an absurd element, namely, that _two_ persons take\n_three_ seats. We digress to the interpretation of the absurdity of\ndreams when we remark that this absurd detail of the dream content is\nintended to represent the most strongly emphasized detail of the dream\nthoughts: \u201cIt was _nonsense_ to marry so early.\u201d The figure 3 belonging\nto a quite subordinate relation of the two compared persons (three\nmonths\u2019 difference in age) has thus been skilfully used to produce the\nnonsense demanded by the dream. The reduction of the actual 150 florins\nto 1 florin and 50 kreuzer corresponds to her disdain of her husband in\nthe suppressed thoughts of the dreamer.\u201d\nIII. Another example displays the arithmetical powers of the dream,\nwhich have brought it into such disrepute. A man dreams: _He is sitting\nat B\u2014\u2014\u2019s_ (a family of his earlier acquaintance) _and says, \u201cIt was\nnonsense for you not to give me Amy in marriage.\u201d Thereupon he asks the\ngirl, \u201cHow old are you?\u201d Answer: \u201cI was born in 1882.\u201d \u201cAh, then you are\n28 years old.\u201d_\nSince the dream occurs in the year 1898, this is obviously poor\narithmetic, and the inability of the dreamer to calculate may be\ncompared to that of the paralytic, if there is no other way of\nexplaining it. My patient was one of those persons who are always\nthinking about every woman they see. The person who followed him in my\noffice, regularly for several months, was a young lady, whom he used to\nmeet, about whom he used to ask frequently, and to whom he was very\nanxious to be polite. This was the lady whose age he estimated at 28\nyears. So much for explaining the result of the apparent calculation.\nBut 1882 was the year in which he had married. He had been unable to\nrefrain from engaging in conversation with the two females whom he met\nat my house\u2014two girls, by no means youthful, who alternately opened the\ndoor for him, and as he did not find them very responsive, he had given\nhimself the explanation that they probably considered him an elderly\n\u201csettled\u201d gentleman.\nIV. For another number dream with its interpretation,\u2014a\ndream distinguished by its obvious determination, or rather\nover-determination, I am indebted to B. Dattner:\nMy host, a policeman in the municipal service, dreamed that he was\nstanding at his post in the street, which was a wish-realisation. The\ninspector then came over to him, having on his gorget the numbers 22 and\n62 or 26\u2014at all events there were many two\u2019s on it. Division of the\nnumber 2262 in the reproduction of the dream at once points to the fact\nthat the components have separate meanings. It occurs to him that the\nday before, while on duty, they were discussing the duration of their\ntime of service. The occasion for this was furnished by an inspector who\nhad been pensioned at 62 years. The dreamer had only completed 22 years\nof service, and still needed 2 years and 2 months to make him eligible\nfor a 90 per cent. pension. The dream first shows him the fulfilment of\na long wished for wish, the rank of inspector. The superior with 2262 on\nhis collar is himself; he takes care to do his duty on the street, which\nis another preferred wish; he has served his 2 years and 2 months, and\ncan now be retired from the service with full pension, like the\n62\u2013year-old inspector.\nIf we keep in mind these examples and similar ones (to follow), we may\nsay: Dream activity does not calculate at all, whether correctly or\nincorrectly; it joins together in the form of a calculation numerals\nwhich occur in the dream thoughts, and which may serve as allusions to\nmaterial which is incapable of being represented. It thus utilises\nnumerals as material for the expression of its purposes in the same\nmanner as it does names and speeches known as word presentations.\nFor the dream activity cannot compose a new speech. No matter how many\nspeeches and answers may occur in dreams, which may be sensible or\nabsurd in themselves, analysis always shows in such cases that the dream\nhas only taken from the dream thoughts fragments of speeches which have\nbeen delivered or heard, and dealt with them in a most arbitrary manner.\nIt has not only torn them from their context and mutilated them, taken\nup one piece and rejected another, but it has also joined them together\nin a new way, so that the speech which seems coherent in the dream falls\ninto three or four sections in the course of analysis. In this new\nutilisation of the words, the dream has often put aside the meaning\nwhich they had in the dream thoughts, and has derived an entirely new\nmeaning from them.[EO] Upon closer inspection the more distinct and\ncompact constituents of the dream speech may be distinguished from\nothers which serve as connectives and have probably been supplied, just\nas we supply omitted letters and syllables in reading. The dream speech\nthus has the structure of breccia stones, in which larger pieces of\ndifferent material are held together by a solidified cohesive mass.\nIn a very strict sense this description is correct, to be sure, only for\nthose speeches in the dream which have something of the sensational\ncharacter of a speech, and which are described as \u201cspeeches.\u201d The others\nwhich have not, as it were, been felt as though heard or spoken (which\nhave no accompanying acoustic or motor emphasis in the dream) are simply\nthoughts such as occur in our waking thought activity, and are\ntransferred without change into many dreams. Our reading, also, seems to\nfurnish an abundant and not easily traceable source of material for\nspeeches, this material being of an indifferent nature. Everything,\nhowever, which appears conspicuously in the dream as a speech can be\nreferred to real speeches which have been made or heard by the dreamer\nhimself.\nWe have already found examples for the explanation of such dream\nspeeches in the analysis of dreams cited for other purposes. Here is one\nexample in place of many, all of which lead to the same conclusion.\n_A large courtyard in which corpses are cremated. The dreamer says: \u201cI\u2019m\ngoing away from here, I can\u2019t look at this.\u201d_ (Not a distinct speech.)\n_Then he meets two butcher boys and asks: \u201cWell, did it taste good?\u201d One\nof them answers: \u201cNo, it wasn\u2019t good.\u201d As though it had been human\nflesh._\nThe harmless occasion for this dream is as follows: After taking supper\nwith his wife, the dreamer pays a visit to his worthy but by no means\nappetising neighbour. The hospitable old lady is just at her evening\nmeal, and _urges_ him (instead of this word a composite\nsexually-significant word is jocosely used among men) to taste of it. He\ndeclines, saying that he has no appetite. \u201c_Go on_, you can stand some\nmore,\u201d or something of the kind. The dreamer is thus forced to taste and\npraise what is offered. \u201cBut that\u2019s good!\u201d After he is alone again with\nhis wife, he scolds about the neighbour\u2019s importunity and about the\nquality of the food he has tasted. \u201cI can\u2019t stand the sight of it,\u201d a\nphrase not appearing even in the dream as an actual speech, is a thought\nwhich has reference to the physical charms of the lady who invites him,\nand which would be translated as meaning that he does not want to look\nat her.\nThe analysis of another dream which I cite at this point for the sake of\nthe very distinct speech that forms its nucleus, but which I shall\nexplain only when we come to consider emotions in the dream\u2014will be more\ninstructive. I dream very distinctly: _I have gone to Bruecke\u2019s\nlaboratory at night, and upon hearing a soft knocking at the door, I\nopen it to (the deceased) Professor Fleischl, who enters in the company\nof several strangers, and after saying a few words sits down at his\ntable._ Then follows a second dream: _My friend Fl. has come to Vienna\nin July without attracting much attention; I meet him on the street\nwhile he is in conversation with my_ (deceased) _friend P., and I go\nsomewhere or other with these two, and they sit down opposite each other\nas though at a little table, while I sit at the narrow end of the table\nfacing them. Fl. tells about his sister and says: \u201cIn three-quarters of\nan hour she was dead,\u201d and then something like: \u201cThat is the threshold.\u201d\nAs P. does not understand him, Fl. turns to me, and asks me how much I\nhave told of his affairs. Whereupon, seized by strange emotions, I want\nto tell Fl. that P._ (can\u2019t possibly know anything because he) _is not\nalive. But, noticing the mistake myself, I say: \u201cNon vixit.\u201d Then I look\nat P. searchingly, and under my gaze he becomes pale and blurred, his\neyes a morbid blue\u2014and at last he dissolves. I rejoice greatly at this;\nI now understand that Ernest Fleischl, too, was only an apparition, a\nrevenant, and I find that it is quite possible for such a person to\nexist only as long as one wants him to, and that he can be made to\ndisappear by the wish of another person._\nThis beautiful dream unites so many of the characteristics of the dream\ncontent which are problematic\u2014the criticism made in the dream itself in\nthat I myself notice my mistake in having said \u201cNon vixit\u201d instead of\n\u201cNon vivit\u201d; the unconstrained intercourse with dead persons, whom the\ndream itself declares to be dead; the absurdity of the inference and the\nintense satisfaction which the inference gives me\u2014that \u201cby my life\u201d I\nshould like to give a complete solution of these problems. But in\nreality I am incapable of doing this\u2014namely, the thing I do in the\ndream\u2014of sacrificing such dear persons to my ambition. With every\nrevelation of the true meaning of the dream, with which I am well\nacquainted, I should have been put to shame. Hence I am content with\nselecting a few of the elements of the dream, for interpretation, some\nhere, and others later on another page.\nThe scene in which I annihilate P. by a glance forms the centre of the\ndream. His eyes become strange and weirdly blue, and then he dissolves.\nThis scene is an unmistakable copy of one really experienced. I was a\ndemonstrator at the physiological institute, and began my service in the\nearly hours, and _Bruecke_ learned that I had been late several times in\ngetting to the school laboratory. So one morning he came promptly for\nthe opening of the class and waited for me. What he said to me was brief\nand to the point; but the words did not matter at all. What overwhelmed\nme was the terrible blue eyes through which he looked at me and before\nwhich I melted away\u2014as P. does in the dream, for P. has changed r\u00f4les\nwith him much to my relief. Anyone who remembers the eyes of the great\nmaster, which were wonderfully beautiful until old age, and who has ever\nseen him in anger, can easily imagine the emotions of the young\ntransgressor on that occasion.\nBut for a long time I was unable to account for the \u201cNon Vixit,\u201d with\nwhich I execute sentence in the dream, until I remembered that these two\nwords possessed such great distinctness in the dream, not because they\nwere heard or spoken, but because they were _seen_. Then I knew at once\nwhere they came from. On the pedestal of the statue of Emperor Joseph in\nthe Hofburg at Vienna, may be read the following beautiful words:\nSaluti patriae _vixit\nnon_ diu sed totus.\nI had culled from this inscription something which suited the one\ninimical train of thought in the dream thoughts and which now intended\nto mean: \u201cThat fellow has nothing to say, he is not living at all.\u201d And\nI now recalled that the dream was dreamed a few days after the unveiling\nof the memorial to _Fleischl_ in the arcades of the university, upon\nwhich occasion I had again seen _Bruecke\u2019s_ statue and must have thought\nwith regret (in the unconscious) how my highly gifted friend P. with his\ngreat devotion to science had forfeited his just claim to a statue in\nthese halls by his premature death. So I set up this memorial to him in\nthe dream; the first name of my friend P. is Joseph.[EP]\nAccording to the rules of dream interpretation, I should still not be\njustified in replacing _non vivit_, which I need, by _non vixit_, which\nis placed at my disposal by the recollection of the Joseph monument.\nSomething now calls my attention to the fact that in the dream scene,\ntwo trains of thought concerning my friend P. meet, one hostile, the\nother friendly\u2014of which the former is superficial, the latter veiled,\nand both are given representation in the same words: _non vixit_.\nBecause my friend P. has deserved well of science, I erect a statue to\nhim; but because he has been guilty of an evil wish (which is expressed\nat the end of the dream) I destroy him. I have here constructed a\nsentence of peculiar resonance, and I must have been influenced by some\nmodel. But where can I find similar antithesis, such a parallel between\ntwo opposite attitudes towards the same person, both claiming to be\nentirely valid, and yet both trying not to encroach upon each other?\nSuch a parallel is to be found in a single place, where, however, a deep\nimpression is made upon the reader\u2014in Brutus\u2019 speech of justification in\nShakespeare\u2019s _Julius C\u00e6sar_: \u201cAs C\u00e6sar loved me, I weep for him; as he\nwas fortunate, I rejoice at it; as he was valiant, I honour him; but, as\nhe was ambitious, I slew him.\u201d Is not this which I have discovered, the\nsame sentence structure and thought contrast as in the dream thought? I\nthus play Brutus in the dream. If I could only find in the dream\nthoughts, one further trace of confirmation for this astonishing\ncollateral connection! I think the following might be such: My friend\ncomes to Vienna in _July_. This detail finds no support whatever in\nreality. To my knowledge my friend has never been in Vienna during the\nmonth of _July_. But the month of _July_ is named after _Julius C\u00e6sar_,\nand might therefore very well furnish the required allusion to the\nintermediary thought that I am playing the part of Brutus.[EQ]\nStrangely enough I once actually played the part of Brutus. I presented\nthe scene between Brutus and C\u00e6sar from Schiller\u2019s poems to an audience\nof children when I was a boy of fourteen years. I did this with my\nnephew, who was a year older than I, and who had come to us from\nEngland\u2014also a _revenant_\u2014for in him I recognised the playmate of my\nfirst childish years. Until the end of my third year we had been\ninseparable, had loved each other and scuffled with each other, and, as\nI have already intimated, this childish relation has constantly\ndetermined my later feelings in my intercourse with persons of my own\nage. My nephew John has since found many incarnations, which have\nrevivified first one aspect, then another, of this character which is so\nineradicably fixed in my unconscious memory. Occasionally he must have\ntreated me very badly and I must have shown courage before my tyrant,\nfor in later years I have often been told of the short speech with which\nI vindicated myself when my father\u2014his grandfather\u2014called me to account:\n\u201cI hit him because he hit me.\u201d This childish scene must be the one which\ncauses _non vivit_ to branch off into _non vixit_, for in the language\nof later childhood striking is called _wichsen_ (German, _wichsen_\u2014to\nsmear with shoe-polish, to tan, _i.e._, to flog); the dream activity\ndoes not hesitate to take advantage of such connections. My hostility\ntowards my friend P., which has so little foundation in reality\u2014he was\nfar superior to me, and might therefore have been a new edition of the\nplaymate of my childhood\u2014can certainly be traced to my complicated\nrelations with John during our infancy. I shall, however, return to this\ndream later.\n(_f_) _Absurd Dreams\u2014Intellectual Performances in the Dream_\nIn our interpretation of dreams thus far we have come upon the element\nof _absurdity_ in the dream-content so often that we must no longer\npostpone an investigation of its cause and significance. We remember, of\ncourse, that the absurdity of dreams has furnished the opponents of\ndream investigation with their chief argument for considering the dream\nnothing but the meaningless product of a reduced and fragmentary\nactivity of the mind.\nI begin with specimens in which the absurdity of the dream-content is\nonly apparent and immediately disappears when the dream is more\nthoroughly examined. There are a few dreams which\u2014accidentally one is at\nfirst inclined to think\u2014are concerned with the dead father of the\ndreamer.\nI. Here is the dream of a patient who had lost his father six years\nbefore:\n_A terrible accident has occurred to his father. He was riding in the\nnight train when a derailment took place, the seats came together, and\nhis head was crushed from side to side. The dreamer sees him lying on\nthe bed with a wound over his left eyebrow, which runs off vertically.\nThe dreamer is surprised that his father has had a misfortune (since he\nis dead already, as the dreamer adds in telling his dream). His father\u2019s\neyes are so clear._\nAccording to the standards prevailing in dream criticism, this\ndream-content would have to be explained in the following manner: At\nfirst, when the dreamer is picturing his father\u2019s misfortune, he has\nforgotten that his father has already been in his grave for years; in\nthe further course of the dream this memory comes to life, and causes\nhim to be surprised at his own dream even while he is still dreaming.\nAnalysis, however, teaches us that it is entirely useless to attempt\nsuch explanations. The dreamer had given an artist an order for a bust\nof his father, which he had inspected two days before the dream. This is\nthe thing which seems to him to have met with an _accident_. The\nsculptor has never seen the father, and is working from photographs\nwhich have been given him. On the very day before the dream the pious\nson had sent an old servant of the family to the studio in order to see\nwhether he would pass the same judgment upon the marble head, namely,\nthat it had turned out too _narrow from side to side_, from temple to\ntemple. Now follows the mass of recollections which has contributed to\nthe formation of this dream. The dreamer\u2019s father had a habit, whenever\nhe was harassed by business cares or family difficulties, of pressing\nhis temples with both hands, as though he were trying to compress his\nhead, which seemed to grow too large for him. When our dreamer was four\nyears old he was present when the accidental discharge of a pistol\nblackened his father\u2019s eyes (_his eyes are so clear_). While alive his\nfather had had a deep wrinkle at the place where the dream shows the\ninjury, whenever he was thoughtful or sad. The fact that in the dream\nthis wrinkle is replaced by a wound points to the second occasion of the\ndream. The dreamer had taken a photograph of his little daughter; the\nplate had fallen from his hand, and when picked up showed a crack that\nran like a vertical furrow across the forehead and reached as far as the\norbital curve. He could not then get the better of his superstitious\nforebodings, for, on the day before his mother\u2019s death, a photographic\nplate with her likeness had cracked as he was handling it.\nThus the absurdity of the dream is only the result of an inaccuracy of\nverbal expression, which does not take the trouble to distinguish the\nbust and the photograph from the original. We are all accustomed to say\nof a picture, \u201cDon\u2019t you think father is good?\u201d Of course the appearance\nof absurdity in this dream might easily have been avoided. If it were\npermissible to pass judgment after a single experience, one might be\ntempted to say that this semblance of absurdity is admitted or desired.\nII. Here is another very similar example from my own dreams (I lost my\nfather in the year 1896):\n_After his death my father has been politically active among the\nMagyars, and has united them into a political body_; to accompany which\nI see a little indistinct picture: _a crowd of people as in the\nReichstag; a person who is standing on one or two benches, others round\nabout him. I remember that he looked very like Garibaldi on his\ndeath-bed, and I am glad that this promise has really come true._\nThis is certainly absurd enough. It was dreamed at the time that the\nHungarians got into a lawless condition, through Parliamentary\nobstruction, and passed through the crisis from which Koloman Szell\ndelivered them. The trivial circumstance that the scene beheld in the\ndream consists of such little pictures is not without significance for\nthe explanation of this element. The usual visual representation of our\nthoughts results in pictures which impress us as being life-size; my\ndream picture, however, is the reproduction of a wood-cut inserted in\nthe text of an illustrated history of Austria, representing Maria\nTheresa in the Reichstag of Pressburg\u2014the famous scene of \u201cMoriamur pro\nrege nostro.\u201d[ER] Like Maria Theresa, my father, in the dream, stands\nsurrounded by the multitude; but he is standing on one or two benches,\nand thus like a judge on the bench. (He has _united_ them\u2014here the\nintermediary is the phrase, \u201cWe shall need no _judge_.\u201d) Those of us who\nstood around the death-bed of my father actually noticed that he looked\nmuch like Garibaldi. He had a _post-mortem_ rise of temperature, his\ncheeks shone redder and redder ... involuntarily we continue: \u201cAnd\nbehind him lay in phantom radiance that which subdues us all\u2014the common\nthing.\u201d\nThis elevation of our thoughts prepares us for having to deal with this\nvery \u201ccommon thing.\u201d The _post-mortem_ feature of the rise in\ntemperature corresponds to the words, \u201cafter his death\u201d in the dream\ncontent. The most agonising of his sufferings had been a complete\nparalysis of the intestines (_obstruction_), which set in during the\nlast weeks. All sorts of disrespectful thoughts are connected with this.\nA man of my own age who had lost his father while he was still at the\nGymnasium, upon which occasion I was profoundly moved and tendered him\nmy friendship, once told me, with derision, about the distress of a lady\nrelative whose father had died on the street and had been brought home,\nwhere it turned out upon undressing the corpse, that at the moment of\ndeath, or _post-mortem_, an evacuation of the bowels had taken place.\nThe daughter of the dead man was profoundly unhappy at having this ugly\ndetail stain her memory of her father. We have now penetrated to the\nwish that is embodied in this dream. _To stand before one\u2019s children\npure and great after one\u2019s death_, who would not wish that? What has\nbecome of the absurdity of the dream? The appearance of it has been\ncaused only by the fact that a perfectly permissible mode of speech\u2014in\nthe case of which we are accustomed to ignore the absurdity that happens\nto exist between its parts\u2014has been faithfully represented in the dream.\nHere, too, we are unable to deny that the semblance of absurdity is one\nwhich is desired and has been purposely brought about.[ES]\nIII. In the example which I now cite I can detect the dream activity in\nthe act of purposely manufacturing an absurdity for which there is no\noccasion at all in the subject-matter. It is taken from the dream that I\nhad as a result of meeting Count Thun before my vacation trip. \u201c_I am\nriding in a one-horse carriage, and give orders to drive to a railway\nstation. \u2018Of course I cannot ride with you on the railway line itself,\u2019\nI say, after the driver made an objection as though I had tired him out;\nat the same time it seems as though I had already driven with him for a\ndistance which one usually rides on the train._\u201d For this confused and\nsenseless story the analysis gives the following explanation: During the\nday I had hired a one-horse carriage which was to take me to a remote\nstreet in Dornbach. The driver, however, did not know the way, and kept\non driving in the manner of those good people until I noticed the fact\nand showed him the way, not sparing him a few mocking remarks withal.\nFrom this driver a train of thought led to the aristocratic personage\nwhom I was destined to meet later. For the present I shall only remark\nthat what strikes us middle-class plebeians about the aristocracy is\nthat they like to put themselves in the driver\u2019s seat. Does not Count\nThun guide the Austrian car of state? The next sentence in the dream,\nhowever, refers to my brother, whom I identify with the driver of the\none-horse carriage. I had this year refused to take the trip through\nItaly with him (\u201cof course I cannot ride with you on the railway line\nitself\u201d), and this refusal was a sort of punishment for his wonted\ncomplaint that I usually tired him out on this trip (which gets into the\ndream unchanged) by making him take hurried trips and see too many nice\nthings in one day. That evening my brother had accompanied me to the\nrailroad station, but shortly before getting there had jumped out, at\nthe state railway division of the Western Station, in order to take a\ntrain to Purkersdorf. I remarked to him that he could stay with me a\nlittle longer, inasmuch as he did not go to Purkersdorf by the state\nrailway but by the Western Railway. This is how it happens that in the\ndream I rode in the wagon a distance _which one usually rides on the\ntrain_. In reality, however, it was just the opposite; I told my\nbrother: The distance which you ride on the state railway you could ride\nin my company on the Western Railway. The whole confusion of the dream\nis therefore produced by my inserting in the dream the word \u201cwagon\u201d\ninstead of \u201cstate railway,\u201d which, to be sure, does good service in\nbringing together the driver and my brother. I then find in the dream\nsome nonsense which seems hardly straightened out by my explanation, and\nwhich almost forms a contradiction to my earlier speech (\u201cOf course I\ncannot ride with you on the railway line itself\u201d). But as I have no\noccasion whatever for confounding the state railway with the one-horse\ncarriage, I must have intentionally formed the whole puzzling story in\nthe dream in this way.\nBut with what intention? We shall now learn what the absurdity in the\ndream signifies, and the motives which admitted it or created it. The\nsolution of the mystery in the case in question is as follows: In the\ndream I needed something absurd and incomprehensible in connection with\n\u201criding\u201d (Fahren) because in the dream thoughts I had a certain judgment\nwhich required representation. On an evening at the house of the\nhospitable and clever lady who appears in another scene of the same\ndream as the \u201chostess,\u201d I heard two riddles which I could not solve. As\nthey were known to the other members of the party, I presented a\nsomewhat ludicrous figure in my unsuccessful attempts to find a\nsolution. They were two equivoques turning on the words \u201cNachkommen\u201d (to\ncome after\u2014offspring) and \u201cvorfahren\u201d (to ride in advance\u2014forefathers,\nancestry). They read as follows:\nThe coachman does it\nAt the master\u2019s behest;\nEveryone has it,\nIn the grave does it rest.\n(Ancestry.)\nIt was confusing to find half of the second riddle identical with the\nfirst.\nThe coachman does it\nAt the master\u2019s behest;\nNot everyone has it,\nIn the cradle does it rest.\n(Offspring.)\nAs I had seen Count Thun ride in advance (vorfahren), so high and\nmighty, and had merged into the Figaro-mood which finds the merit of\naristocratic gentlemen in the fact that they have taken the trouble to\nbe born (Nachkommen\u2014to become offspring), the two riddles became\nintermediary thoughts for the dream-work. As aristocrats can be readily\nconfounded with coachmen, and as coachmen were in our country formerly\ncalled brothers-in-law, the work of condensation could employ my brother\nin the same representation. But the dream thought at work in the\nbackground was as follows: _It is nonsense to be proud of one\u2019s\nancestry. (Vorfahren.) I would rather be myself an ancestor. (Vorfahr.)_\nFor the sake of this judgment, \u201cit is nonsense,\u201d we have the nonsense in\nthe dream. We can now also solve the last riddle in this obscure passage\nof the dream, namely, that I have already driven before (vorher\ngefahren, vorgefahren) with the coachman.\nThus the dream is made absurd if there occurs as one of the elements in\nthe dream thoughts the judgment \u201c_That is nonsense_,\u201d and in general if\ndisdain and criticism are the motives for one of the trains of\nunconscious thought. Hence absurdity becomes one of the means by which\nthe dream activity expresses contradiction, as it does by reversing a\nrelation in the material between the dream thoughts and dream content,\nand by utilising sensations of motor impediment. But absurdity in the\ndream is not simply to be translated by \u201cno\u201d; it is rather intended to\nreproduce the disposition of the dream thoughts, this being to show\nmockery and ridicule along with the contradiction. It is only for this\npurpose that the dream activity produces anything ridiculous. Here again\nit transforms _a part of the latent content into a manifest form_.[ET]\nAs a matter of fact we have already met with a convincing example of the\nsignificance of an absurd dream. The dream, interpreted without\nanalysis, of the Wagnerian performance lasting until 7.45 in the\nmorning, in which the orchestra is conducted from a tower, &c. (see p.\n316) is apparently trying to say: It is a _crazy_ world and an _insane_\nsociety. He who deserves a thing doesn\u2019t get it, and he who doesn\u2019t care\nfor anything has it\u2014and in this she means to compare her fate with that\nof her cousin. The fact that dreams concerning a dead father were the\nfirst to furnish us with examples of absurdity in dreams is by no means\nan accident. The conditions necessary for the creations of absurd dreams\nare here grouped together in a typical manner. The authority belonging\nto the father has at an early age aroused the criticism of the child,\nand the strict demands he has made have caused the child to pay\nparticularly close attention to every weakness of the father for its own\nextenuation; but the piety with which the father\u2019s personality is\nsurrounded in our thoughts, especially after his death, increases the\ncensorship which prevents the expressions of this criticism from\nbecoming conscious.\nIV. The following is another absurd dream about a dead father:\n_I receive a notice from the common council of my native city concerning\nthe costs of a confinement in the hospital in the year 1851, which was\nnecessitated by an attack from which I suffered. I make sport of the\nmatter, for, in the first place, I was not yet alive in the year 1851,\nand, in the second place, my father, to whom the notice might refer, is\nalready dead. I go to him in the adjoining room, where he is lying on a\nbed, and tell him about it. To my astonishment he recalls that in that\nyear\u20141851\u2014he was once drunk and had to be locked up or confined. It was\nwhen he was working for the house of T\u2014\u2014. \u201cThen you drank, too?\u201d I ask.\n\u201cYou married soon after?\u201d I figure that I was born in 1856, which\nappears to me as though immediately following._\nIn view of the preceding discussion, we shall translate the insistence\nwith which this dream exhibits its absurdities as the sure sign of a\nparticularly embittered and passionate controversy in the dream\nthoughts. With all the more astonishment, however, we note that in this\ndream the controversy is waged openly, and the father designated as the\nperson against whom the satire is directed. This openness seems to\ncontradict our assumption of a censor as operative in the dream\nactivity. We may say in explanation, however, that here the father is\nonly an interposed person, while the conflict is carried on with another\none, who makes his appearance in the dream by means of a single\nallusion. While the dream usually treats of revolt against other\npersons, behind which the father is concealed, the reverse is true here;\nthe father serves as the man of straw to represent others, and hence the\ndream dares thus openly to concern itself with a person who is usually\nhallowed, because there is present the certain knowledge that he is not\nin reality intended. We learn of this condition of affairs by\nconsidering the occasion of the dream. Now, it occurred after I had\nheard that an older colleague, whose judgment is considered infallible,\nhad expressed disapproval and astonishment at the fact that one of my\npatients was then continuing psychoanalytical work with me for the fifth\nyear. The introductory sentences of the dream point with transparent\ndisguise to the fact that this colleague had for a time taken over the\nduties which my father could no longer perform (_expenses, fees at the\nhospital_); and when our friendly relations came to be broken I was\nthrown into the same conflict of feelings which arises in the case of\nmisunderstanding between father and son in view of the part played by\nthe father and his earlier functions. The dream thoughts now bitterly\nresent the reproach that I _am not making better progress_, which\nextends itself from the treatment of this patient to other things. Does\nthis colleague know anyone who can get on faster? Does he not know that\nconditions of this sort are usually incurable and last for life? What\nare four or five years in comparison to a whole life, especially when\nlife has been made so much easier for the patient during the treatment?\nThe impression of absurdity in this dream is brought about largely by\nthe fact that sentences from different divisions of the dream thoughts\nare strung together without any reconciling transition. Thus the\nsentence, _I go to him in the adjoining room, &c._, leaves the subject\ndealt with in the preceding sentences, and faithfully reproduces the\ncircumstances under which I told my father about my marriage engagement.\nThus the dream is trying to remind me of the noble disinterestedness\nwhich the old man showed at that time, and to put it in contrast with\nthe conduct of another, a new person. I now perceive that the dream is\nallowed to make sport of my father for the reason that in the dream\nthought he is held up as an example to another man, in full recognition\nof his merit. It is in the nature of every censorship that it permits\nthe telling of untruth about forbidden things rather than truth. The\nnext sentence, in which my father remembers having _once been drunk_,\nand having been _locked up for it_, also contains nothing which is\nactually true of my father. The person whom he covers is here a no less\nimportant one than the great Meynert, in whose footsteps I followed with\nsuch great veneration, and whose attitude towards me was changed into\nundisguised hostility after a short period of indulgence. The dream\nrecalls to me his own statement that in his youth he was addicted to the\n_chloroform_ habit, and that for this he had to enter a sanatorium. It\nrecalls also a second experience with him shortly before his death. I\ncarried on an embittered literary controversy with him concerning\nhysteria in the male, the existence of which he denied, and when I\nvisited him in his last illness and asked him how he felt, he dwelt upon\nthe details of his condition and concluded with the words: \u201cYou know, I\nhave always been one of the prettiest cases of masculine hysteria.\u201d\nThus, to my satisfaction, and _to my astonishment_, he admitted what he\nhad so long and so stubbornly opposed. But the fact that in this scene I\ncan use my father to cover Meynert is based not upon the analogy which\nhas been found to exist between the two persons, but upon the slight,\nbut quite adequate, representation of a conditional sentence occurring\nin the dream thoughts, which in full would read as follows: \u201cOf course\nif I were of the second generation, the son of a professor or of a\ncourt-councillor, I should have _progressed more rapidly_.\u201d In the dream\nI now make a court-councillor and a professor of my father. The most\nobvious and most annoying absurdity of the dream lies in the treatment\nof the date 1851, which seems to me to be hardly distinguishable from\n1856, as though _a difference of five years would signify nothing\nwhatever_. But it is just this idea of the dream thoughts which requires\nexpression. _Four or five years_\u2014that is the length of time which I\nenjoyed the support of the colleague mentioned at the outset; but it is\nalso the time during which I kept my bride waiting before I married her;\nand, through a coincidence that is eagerly taken advantage of by the\ndream thoughts, it is also the time during which I am now keeping one of\nmy best patients waiting for the completion of his cure. \u201c_What are five\nyears?_\u201d ask the dream thoughts. \u201c_That is no time at all for me\u2014that\ndoesn\u2019t come into consideration._ I have time enough ahead of me, and\njust as what you didn\u2019t want to believe came true at last, so I shall\naccomplish this also.\u201d Besides the number 51, when separated from the\nnumber of the century, is determined in still another manner and in an\nopposite sense; for which reason it occurs in the dream again. Fifty-one\nis an age at which a man seems particularly exposed to danger, at which\nI have seen many of my colleagues suddenly die, and among them one who\nhad been appointed to a professorship a few days before, after he had\nbeen waiting a long time.\nV. Another absurd dream which plays with figures, runs as follows:\n_One of my acquaintances, Mr. M., has been attacked in an essay by no\nless a person than Goethe, with justifiable vehemence, we all think. Mr.\nM. has, of course, been crushed by this attack. He complains of it\nbitterly at a dinner party; but he says that his veneration for Goethe\nhas not suffered from this personal experience. I try to find some\nexplanation of the chronological relations, which seem improbable to me.\nGoethe died in 1832; since his attack upon M. must of course have taken\nplace earlier, Mr. M. was at the time a very young man. It seems\nplausible to me that he was 18 years old. But I do not know exactly what\nyear it is at present, and so the whole calculation lapses into\nobscurity. The attack, moreover, is contained in Goethe\u2019s well-known\nessay entitled \u201cNature.\u201d_\nWe shall soon find means to justify the nonsense of this dream. Mr. M.,\nwith whom I became acquainted _at a dinner-party_, had recently\nrequested me to examine his brother, who showed signs of _paralytic\ninsanity_. The conjecture was right; the painful thing about this visit\nwas that the patient exposed his brother by alluding to his youthful\npranks when there was no occasion in the conversation for his doing so.\nI had asked the patient to tell me the year of his birth, and had got\nhim to make several small calculations in order to bring out the\nweakness of his memory\u2014all of which tests he passed fairly well. I see\nnow that I am acting like a paralytic in the dream (_I do not know\nexactly what year it is at present_). Other subject-matter in the dream\nis drawn from another recent source. The editor of a medical journal, a\nfriend of mine, had accepted for his paper a very unfavourable, a\n\u201c_crushing_,\u201d criticism of the last book of my friend Fl. of Berlin, the\nauthor of which was a very _youthful_ reviewer, who was not very\ncompetent to pass judgment. I thought I had a right to interfere, and\ncalled the editor to account; he keenly regretted the acceptance of the\ncriticism, but would not promise redress. Thereupon I broke off\nrelations with the journal, and in my letter of resignation expressed\nthe hope that _our personal relations would not suffer from the\nincident_. The third source of this dream is an account given by a\nfemale patient\u2014it was fresh in my memory at the time\u2014of the mental\ndisease of her brother who had fallen into a frenzy, crying \u201cNature,\nNature.\u201d The physicians in attendance thought that the cry was derived\nfrom a reading of Goethe\u2019s beautiful _essay_, and that it pointed to\noverwork in the patient in the study of natural philosophy. I thought\nrather of the sexual sense in which even less cultured people with us\nuse the word \u201cNature,\u201d and the fact that the unfortunate man later\nmutilated his genitals seemed to show that I was not far wrong. Eighteen\nyears was the age of this patient at the time when the attack of frenzy\noccurred.\nIf I add further that the book of my friend so severely criticised (\u201cIt\nis a question whether the author is crazy or we are\u201d had been the\nopinion of another critic) treats of the _temporal relations of life_\nand refers the duration of Goethe\u2019s life to the multiple of a number\nsignificant from the point of view of biology, it will readily be\nadmitted that I am putting myself in the place of my friend in the\ndream. (_I try to find some explanation of the chronological\nrelations._) But I behave like a paralytic, and the dream revels in\nabsurdity. This means, then, as the dream thoughts say ironically. \u201cOf\ncourse he is the fool, the lunatic, and you are the man of genius who\nknows better. Perhaps, however, it is the other way around?\u201d Now, this\nother way around is explicitly represented in the dream, in that Goethe\nhas attacked the young man, which is absurd, while it is perfectly\npossible even to-day for a young fellow to attack the immortal Goethe,\nand in that I figure from the year of Goethe\u2019s death, while I caused the\nparalytic to calculate from the year of his birth.\nBut I have already promised to show that every dream is the result of\negotistical motives. Accordingly, I must account for the fact that in\nthis dream I make my friend\u2019s cause my own and put myself in his place.\nMy rational conviction in waking thought is not adequate to do this.\nNow, the story of the eighteen-year-old patient and of the various\ninterpretations of his cry, \u201cNature,\u201d alludes to my having brought\nmyself into opposition to most physicians by claiming sexual etiology\nfor the psychoneuroses. I may say to myself: \u201cThe same kind of criticism\nyour friend met with you will meet with too, and have already met with\nto some extent,\u201d and now I may replace the \u201che\u201d in the dream thoughts by\n\u201cwe.\u201d \u201cYes, you are right; we two are the fools.\u201d That _mea res agitur_,\nis clearly shown by the mention of the short, incomparably beautiful\nessay of Goethe, for it was a public reading of this essay which induced\nme to study the natural science while I was still undecided in the\ngraduating class of the Gymnasium.\nVI. I am also bound to show of another dream in which my ego does not\noccur that it is egotistic. On page 228 I mentioned a short dream in\nwhich Professor M. says: \u201cMy son, the myopic ...\u201d; and I stated that\nthis was only a preliminary dream to another one, in which I play a\npart. Here is the main dream, omitted above, which challenges us to\nexplain its absurd and unintelligible word-formation.\n_On account of some happenings or other in the city of Rome it is\nnecessary for the children to flee, and this they do. The scene is then\nlaid before a gate, a two-winged gate in antique style (the Porta Romana\nin Siena, as I know while I am still dreaming). I am sitting on the edge\nof a well, and am very sad; I almost weep. A feminine person\u2014nurse,\nnun\u2014brings out the two boys and hands them over to their father, who is\nnot myself. The elder of the two is distinctly my eldest son, and I do\nnot see the face of the other; the woman who brings the boy asks him for\na parting kiss. She is distinguished by a red nose. The boy denies her\nthe kiss, but says to her, extending his hand to her in parting, \u201cAuf\nGeseres,\u201d and to both of us (or to one of us) \u201cAuf Ungeseres.\u201d I have\nthe idea, that the latter indicates an advantage._\nThis dream is built upon a tangle of thoughts induced by a play I saw at\nthe theatre, called _Das neue Ghetto_ (\u201cThe New Ghetto.\u201d) The Jewish\nquestion, anxiety about the future of my children who cannot be given a\nnative country of their own, anxiety about bringing them up so that they\nmay have the right of native citizens\u2014all these features may easily be\nrecognised in the accompanying dream thoughts.\n\u201cWe sat by the waters of Babylon and wept.\u201d Siena, like Rome, is famous\nfor its beautiful fountains. In the dream I must find a substitute of\nsome kind for Rome (_cf._ p. 163) in localities which are known to me.\nNear the Porta Romana of Siena we saw a large, brightly illuminated\nbuilding, which we found to be the Manicomio, the insane asylum. Shortly\nbefore the dream I had heard that a co-religionist had been forced to\nresign a position at a state asylum which he had secured with great\neffort.\nOur interest is aroused by the speech: \u201c_Auf Geseres_\u201d\u2014where we might\nexpect, from the situation maintained throughout the dream, \u201c_Auf\nWiedersehen_\u201d (_Au revoir_)\u2014and by its quite meaningless opposite, \u201c_Auf\nUngeseres_.\u201d\nAccording to information I have received from Hebrew scholars, _Geseres_\nis a genuine Hebrew word derived from the verb _goiser_, and may best be\nrendered by \u201cordained sufferings, fated disaster.\u201d From its use in the\nJewish jargon one might think it signified \u201cwailing and lamentation.\u201d\n_Ungeseres_ is a coinage of my own and first attracts my attention; but\nfor the present it baffles me. The little observation at the end of the\ndream, that _Ungeseres_ indicates an advantage over _Geseres_ opens the\nway to the associations and to an explanation. The same relation holds\ngood with caviare; the unsalted kind[EU] is more highly prized than the\nsalted. Caviare to the general, \u201cnoble passions\u201d; herein lies concealed\na joking allusion to a member of my household, of whom I hope\u2014for she is\nyounger than I\u2014that she will watch over the future of my children; this,\ntoo, agrees with the fact that another member of my household, our\nworthy nurse, is clearly indicated in the nurse (or nun) of the dream.\nBut a connecting link is wanting between the pair, _salted_ and\n_unsalted_, and _Geseres\u2014ungeseres_. This is to be found in _soured and\nunsoured_. In their flight or exodus out of Egypt, the children of\nIsrael did not have time to allow their bread to be leavened, and in\nmemory of the event to this day they eat unsoured bread at Easter time.\nHere I can also find room for the sudden notion which came to me in this\npart of the analysis. I remembered how we promenaded about the city of\nBreslau, which was strange to us, at the end of the Easter holidays, my\nfriend from Berlin and I. A little girl asked me to tell her the way to\na certain street; I had to tell her I did not know it, whereupon I\nremarked to my friend, \u201cI hope that later on in life the little one will\nshow more perspicacity in selecting the persons by whom she allows\nherself to be guided.\u201d Shortly afterwards a sign caught my eye: \u201cDr.\n_Herod_, office hours....\u201d I said to myself: \u201cI hope this colleague does\nnot happen to be a children\u2019s specialist.\u201d Meanwhile my friend had been\ndeveloping his views on the biological significance of _bilateral_\nsymmetry, and had begun a sentence as follows: \u201cIf we had but one eye in\nthe middle of our foreheads like _Cyclops_....\u201d This leads us to the\nspeech of the professor in the preliminary dream: \u201cMy son, the\n_myopic_.\u201d And now I have been led to the chief source for _Geseres_.\nMany years ago, when this son of Professor M., who is to-day an\nindependent thinker, was still sitting on his school-bench, he\ncontracted a disease of the eye, which the doctor declared gave cause\nfor anxiety. He was of the opinion that as long as it remained in one\neye it would not matter; if, however, it should extend to the other eye,\nit would be serious. The disease healed in the one eye without leaving\nany bad effects; shortly afterwards, however, its symptoms actually\nappeared in the other eye. The terrified mother of the boy immediately\nsummoned the physician to the seclusion of her country resort. But he\ntook _another view_ of the matter. \u201c_What sort of \u2018Geseres\u2019 is this you\nare making?_\u201d he said to his mother with impatience. \u201cIf one side got\nwell, the other side will get well too.\u201d And so it turned out.\nAnd now as to the connection between this and myself and those dear to\nme. The school-bench upon which the son of Professor M. learned his\nfirst lessons has become the property of my eldest son\u2014it was given to\nhis mother-into whose lips I put the words of parting in the dream. One\nof the wishes that can be attached to this transference may now easily\nbe guessed. This school-bench is intended by its construction to guard\nthe child from becoming shortsighted and one-sided. Hence, myopia (and\nbehind the Cyclops) and the discussion about _bilateralism_. The concern\nabout one-sidedness is of two-fold signification; along with the bodily\none-sidedness, that of intellectual development may be referred to. Does\nit not seem as though the scene in the dream, with all its madness, were\nputting its negative on just this anxiety? After the child has said his\nword of parting _on the one side_, he calls out its opposite on the\n_other side_, as though in order to establish an equilibrium. _He is\nacting, as it were, in obedience to bilateral symmetry!_\nThus the dream frequently has the profoundest meaning in places where it\nseems most absurd. In all ages those who had something to say and were\nunable to say it without danger to themselves gladly put on the cap and\nbells. The listener for whom the forbidden saying was intended was more\nlikely to tolerate it if he was able to laugh at it, and to flatter\nhimself with the comment that what he disliked was obviously something\nabsurd. The dream proceeds in reality just as the prince does in the\nplay who must counterfeit the fool, and hence the same thing may be said\nof the dream which Hamlet says of himself, substituting an\nunintelligible witticism for the real conditions: \u201cI am but mad\nnorth-north-west; when the wind is southerly I know a hawk from a\nhandsaw.\u201d[EV]\nThus my solution of the problem of the absurdity of dreams is that the\ndream thoughts are never absurd\u2014at least not those belonging to the\ndreams of sane persons\u2014and that the dream activity produces absurd\ndreams and dreams with individual absurd elements if criticism,\nridicule, and derision in the dream thoughts are to be represented by it\nin its manner of expression. My next concern is to show that the dream\nactivity is primarily brought about by the co-operation of the three\nfactors which have been mentioned\u2014and of a fourth one which remains to\nbe cited\u2014that it accomplishes nothing short of a transposition of the\ndream thoughts, observing the three conditions which are prescribed for\nit, and that the question whether the mind operates in the dream with\nall its faculties, or only with a portion of them, is deprived of its\ncogency and is inapplicable to the actual circumstances. But since there\nare plenty of dreams in which judgments are passed, criticisms made, and\nfacts recognised, in which astonishment at some single element of the\ndream appears, and arguments and explanations are attempted, I must meet\nthe objections which may be inferred from these occurrences by the\ncitation of selected examples.\nMy answer is as follows: _Everything in the dream which occurs as an\napparent exercise of the critical faculty is to be regarded, not as an\nintellectual accomplishment of the dream activity, but as belonging to\nthe material of the dream thoughts, and it has found its way from them\nas a finished structure to the manifest dream content_. I may go even\nfurther than this. Even the judgments which are passed upon the dream as\nit is remembered after awakening and the feelings which are aroused by\nthe reproduction of the dream, belong in good part to the latent dream\ncontent, and must be fitted into their place in the interpretation of\nthe dream.\nI. A striking example of this I have already given. A female patient\ndoes not wish to relate her dream because it is too vague. She has seen\na person in the dream, and does not know whether it is her husband or\nher father. Then follows a second dream fragment in which there occurs a\n\u201cmanure-can,\u201d which gives rise to the following reminiscence. As a young\nhousewife, she once jokingly declared in the presence of a young\nrelative who frequented the house that her next care would be to procure\na new manure-can. The next morning one was sent to her, but it was\nfilled with lilies of the valley. This part of the dream served to\nrepresent the saying, \u201cNot grown on your own manure.\u201d[EW] When we\ncomplete the analysis we find that in the dream thoughts it is a matter\nof the after-effects of a story heard in youth, to the effect that a\ngirl had given birth to a child _concerning whom it was not clear who\nwas the real father_. The dream representation here goes over into the\nwaking thought, and allows one element of the dream thoughts to be\nrepresented by a judgment expressed in the waking state upon the whole\ndream.\nII. A similar case: One of my patients has a dream which seems\ninteresting to him, for he says to himself immediately after awakening:\n\u201c_I must tell that to the doctor_.\u201d The dream is analysed, and shows the\nmost distinct allusion to an affair in which he had become involved\nduring the treatment, and of which he had decided \u201c_to tell me\nnothing_.\u201d[EX]\nIII. Here is a third example from my own experience:\n_I go to the hospital with P. through a region in which houses and\ngardens occur. With this comes the idea that I have already seen this\nregion in dreams several times. I do not know my way very well; P. shows\nme a way which leads through a corner to a restaurant (a room, not a\ngarden); here I ask for Mrs. Doni, and I hear that she is living in the\nbackground in a little room with three children. I go there, and while\non the way I meet an indistinct person with my two little girls, whom I\ntake with me after I have stood with them for a while. A kind of\nreproach against my wife for having left them there._\nUpon awakening I feel great _satisfaction_, the cause for this being the\nfact that I am now going to learn from the analysis what is meant by the\nidea \u201c_I have already dreamed of that_.\u201d[EY] But the analysis of the\ndream teaches me nothing on the subject; it only shows me that the\nsatisfaction belongs to the latent dream content, and not to my judgment\nupon the dream. It is _satisfaction over the fact that I have had\nchildren by my marriage_. P. is a person in whose company I walked the\npath of life for a certain space, but who has since far outdistanced me\nsocially and materially\u2014whose marriage, however, has remained childless.\nThe two occasions for the dream furnishing the proof of this may be\nfound by means of complete analysis. On the previous day I had read in\nthe paper the obituary notice of a certain Mrs. Dona A\u2014\u2014y (out of which\nI make Doni), who had died in childbirth; I was told by my wife that the\ndead woman had been nursed by the same midwife she herself had had at\nthe birth of our two youngest boys. The name Dona had caught my\nattention, for I had recently found it for the first time in an English\nnovel. The other occasion for the dream may be found in the date on\nwhich it was dreamed; it was on the night before the birthday of my\neldest boy, who, it seems, is poetically gifted.\nIV. The same satisfaction remained with me after awakening from the\nabsurd dream that my father, after his death, had played a political\npart among the Magyars, and it is motivated by a continuance of the\nfeeling which accompanied the last sentence of the dream: \u201c_I remember\nthat on his death-bed he looked so much like Garibaldi, and I am glad\nthat it has really come true. (Here belongs a forgotten continuation.)_\u201d\nI can now supply from the analysis what belongs in this gap of the\ndream. It is the mention of my second boy, to whom I have given the\nfirst name of a great historical personage, who attracted me powerfully\nduring my boyhood, especially during my stay in England. I had to wait\nfor a year after making up my mind to use this name in case the expected\nchild should be a son, and I greeted him with it _in high satisfaction_\nas soon as he was born. It is easy to see how the father\u2019s lust for\ngreatness is transferred in his thoughts to his children; it will\nreadily be believed that this is one of the ways in which the\nsuppression of this lust which becomes necessary in life is brought\nabout. The little fellow won a place in the text of this dream by virtue\nof the fact that the same accident\u2014quite pardonable in a child or a\ndying person\u2014of soiling his clothes had happened to him. With this may\nbe compared the allusion \u201c_Stuhlrichter_\u201d (judge on the stool-bench,\n_i.e._ presiding judge) and the wish of the dream: To stand before one\u2019s\nchildren great and pure.\nV. I am now called upon to find expressions of judgment which remain in\nthe dream itself, and are not retained in or transferred to our waking\nthoughts, and I shall consider it a great relief if I may find examples\nin dreams, which have already been cited for other purposes. The dream\nabout Goethe\u2019s attacking Mr. M. seems to contain a considerable number\nof acts of judgment. _I try to find some explanation of the\nchronological relations, which seem improbable to me._ Does not this\nlook like a critical impulse directed against the nonsensical idea that\nGoethe should have made a literary attack upon a young man of my\nacquaintance? \u201c_It seems plausible to me_ that he was 18 years old.\u201d\nThat sounds quite like the result of a dull-witted calculation; and \u201c_I\ndo not know exactly what year it is_\u201d would be an example of uncertainty\nor doubt in the dream.\nBut I know from analysis that these acts of judgment, which seem to have\nbeen performed in the dream for the first time, admit of a different\nconstruction in the light of which they become indispensable for\ninterpreting the dream, and at the same time every absurdity is avoided.\nWith the sentence, \u201c_I try to find some explanation of the chronological\nrelations_,\u201d I put myself in the place of my friend who is actually\ntrying to explain the chronological relations of life. The sentence then\nloses its significance as a judgment that objects to the nonsense of the\nprevious sentences. The interposition, \u201c_which seems improbable to me_,\u201d\nbelongs to the subsequent \u201c_it seems plausible to me_.\u201d In about the\nsame words I had answered the lady who told me the story of her\nbrother\u2019s illness: \u201c_It seems improbable to me_ that the cry of \u2018Nature,\nNature,\u2019 had anything to do with Goethe; _it appears much more\nplausible_ that it had the sexual significance which is known to you.\u201d\nTo be sure, a judgment has been passed here, not, however, in the dream\nbut in reality, on an occasion which is remembered and utilised by the\ndream thoughts. The dream content appropriates this judgment like any\nother fragment of the dream thoughts.\nThe numeral 18, with which the judgment in the dream is meaninglessly\nconnected, still preserves a trace of the context from which the real\njudgment was torn. Finally, \u201c_I am not certain what year it is_\u201d is\nintended for nothing else than to carry out my identification with the\nparalytic, in the examination of whom this point of confirmation had\nactually been established.\nIn the solution of these apparent acts of judgment, in the dream, it may\nbe well to call attention to the rule of interpretation which says that\nthe coherence which is fabricated in the dream between its constituent\nparts is to be disregarded as specious and unessential, and that every\ndream element must be taken by itself and traced to its source. The\ndream is a conglomeration, which is to be broken up into its elements\nfor the purposes of investigation. But other circumstances call our\nattention to the fact that a psychic force is expressed in dreams which\nestablishes this apparent coherence\u2014that is to say, which subjects the\nmaterial that is obtained by the dream activity to a _secondary\nelaboration_. We are here confronted with manifestations of this force,\nupon which we shall later fix our attention as being the fourth of the\nfactors which take part in the formation of the dream.\nVI. I select other examples of critical activity in the dreams which\nhave already been cited. In the absurd dream about the communication\nfrom the common council I ask the question: \u201c_You married shortly after?\nI figure that I was born in 1856, which appears to me as though\nfollowing immediately_.\u201d This quite takes the form of an _inference_. My\nfather married shortly after his attack in the year 1851; I am the\noldest son, born in 1856; this agrees perfectly. We know that this\ninference has been interpolated by the wish-fulfilment, and that the\nsentence which dominates the dream thoughts is to the following effect:\n_4 or 5 years, that is no time at all, that need not enter the\ncalculation_. But every part of this chain of inferences is to be\ndetermined from the dream thoughts in a different manner, both as to its\ncontent and as to its form. It is the patient\u2014about whose endurance my\ncolleague complains\u2014who intends to marry immediately after the close of\nthe treatment. The manner in which I deal with my father in the dream\nrecalls an _inquest_ or _examination_, and with that the person of a\nuniversity instructor who was in the habit of taking a complete list of\ncredentials at the enrolment of his class: \u201cYou were born when?\u201d In\n1856. \u201cPatre?\u201d Then the applicant gave the first name of his father with\na Latin ending, and we students assumed that the Aulic Councillor drew\n_inferences_ from the first name of the father which the name of the\nenrolled student would not always have supplied. According to this, the\n_drawing of inferences_ in the dream would be merely a repetition of the\n_drawing of inferences_ which appears as part of the subject-matter in\nthe dream thoughts. From this we learn something new. If an inference\noccurs in the dream content, it invariably comes from the dream\nthoughts; it may be contained in these as a bit of remembered material,\nor it may serve as a logical connective in a series of dream thoughts.\nIn any case an inference in the dream represents an inference in the\ndream thoughts.[EZ]\nThe analysis of this dream should be continued here. With the inquest of\nthe Professor there is connected the recollection of an index (published\nin Latin during my time) of the university students; also of my course\nof studies. The _five years_ provided for the study of medicine were as\nusual not enough for me. I worked along unconcernedly in the succeeding\nyears; in the circle of my acquaintances I was considered a loafer, and\nthere was doubt as to whether I would \u201cget through.\u201d Then all at once I\ndecided to take my examinations; and I got \u201cthrough,\u201d _in spite of the\npostponement_. This is a new confirmation of the dream thoughts, which I\ndefiantly hold up to my critics: \u201cEven though you are unwilling to\nbelieve it, because I take my time, I shall reach a conclusion (German\n_Schluss_, meaning either end or conclusion, _inference_). It has often\nhappened that way.\u201d\nIn its introductory portion this dream contains several sentences which\ncannot well be denied the character of an argumentation. And this\nargumentation is not at all absurd; it might just as well belong to\nwaking thought. _In the dream I make sport of the communication of the\nCommon Council, for in the first place I was not yet in the world in\n1851, and in the second place, my father, to whom it might refer, is\nalready dead._ Both are not only correct in themselves, but coincide\ncompletely with the arguments that I should use in case I should receive\na communication of the sort mentioned. We know from our previous\nanalysis that this dream has sprung from deeply embittered and scornful\ndream thoughts; if we may assume further that the motive for censorship\nis a very strong one, we shall understand that the dream activity has\nevery reason to create _a flawless refutation of a baseless insinuation_\naccording to the model contained in the dream thoughts. But analysis\nshows that in this case the dream activity has not had the task of\nmaking a free copy, but it has been required to use subject-matter from\nthe dream thoughts for its purpose. It is as if in an algebraic equation\nthere occurred plus and minus signs, signs of powers and of roots,\nbesides the figures, and as if someone, in copying this equation without\nunderstanding it, should take over into his copy the signs of operation\nas well as the figures, and fail to distinguish between the two kinds.\nThe two arguments may be traced to the following material. It is painful\nfor me to think that many of the assumptions upon which I base my\nsolution of psychoneuroses, as soon as they have become known, will\narouse scepticism and ridicule. Thus I must maintain that impressions\nfrom the second year of life, or even from the first, leave a lasting\ntrace upon the temperament of persons who later become diseased, and\nthat these impressions\u2014greatly distorted it is true, and exaggerated by\nmemory\u2014are capable of furnishing the original and fundamental basis of\nhysterical symptoms. Patients to whom I explain this in its proper place\nare in the habit of making a parody upon the explanation by declaring\nthemselves willing to look for reminiscences of the period _when they\nwere not yet alive_. It would quite accord with my expectation, if\nenlightenment on the subject of the unsuspected part played by the\nfather in the earliest sexual impulses of feminine patients should get a\nsimilar reception. (_Cf._ the discussion on p. 218.) And, nevertheless,\nboth positions are correct according to my well-founded conviction. In\nconfirmation I recall certain examples in which the death of the father\nhappened when the child was very young, and later events, otherwise\ninexplicable, proved that the child had unconsciously preserved\nrecollections of the persons who had so early gone out of its life. I\nknow that both of my assertions are based upon _inferences_ the validity\nof which will be attacked. If the subject-matter of these very\ninferences which I fear will be contested is used by the dream activity\nfor setting up _incontestable inferences_, this is a performance of the\nwish-fulfilment.\nVII. In a dream which I have hitherto only touched upon, astonishment at\nthe subject to be broached is distinctly expressed at the outset.\n\u201c_The elder Bruecke must have given me some task or other; strangely\nenough it relates to the preparation of my own lower body, pelvis and\nlegs, which I see before me as though in the dissecting room, but\nwithout feeling my lack of body and without a trace of horror. Louise N.\nis standing near, and doing her work next to me. The pelvis is\neviscerated; now the upper, now the lower view of the same is seen, and\nthe two views mingle. Thick fleshy red lumps (which even in the dream\nmake me think of h\u00e6morrhoids) are to be seen. Also something had to be\ncarefully picked out, which lay over these and which looked like\ncrumpled tinfoil.[FA] Then I was again in possession of my legs and made\na journey through the city, but took a wagon (owing to my fatigue). To\nmy astonishment the wagon drove into a house door, which opened and\nallowed it to pass into a passage that was snapped off at the end, and\nfinally led further on into the open.[FB] At last I wandered through\nchanging landscapes with an Alpine guide, who carried my things. He\ncarried, me for some way, out of consideration for my tired legs. The\nground was muddy, and we went along the edge; people sat on the ground,\na girl among them, like Indians or Gypsies. Previously I had moved\nmyself along on the slippery ground, with constant astonishment that I\nwas so well able to do it after the preparation. At last we came to a\nsmall wooden house which ended in an open window. Here the guide set me\ndown, and laid two wooden boards which stood in readiness on the window\nsill, in order that in this way the chasm might be bridged which had to\nbe crossed in order to get to the window. Now, I grew really frightened\nabout my legs. Instead of the expected crossing, I saw two grown-up men\nlying upon wooden benches which were on the walls of the hut, and\nsomething like two sleeping children next to them. It seems as though\nnot the boards but the children were intended to make possible the\ncrossing. I awakened with frightened thoughts._\u201d\nAnyone who has formed a proper idea of the abundance of dream\ncondensation will easily be able to imagine how great a number of pages\nthe detailed analysis of this dream must fill. Luckily for the context,\nI shall take from it merely the one example of astonishment, in the\ndream, which makes its appearance in the parenthetical remark,\n\u201c_strangely enough_.\u201d Let us take up the occasion of the dream. It is a\nvisit of this lady, Louise N., who assists at the work in the dream. She\nsays: \u201cLend me something to read.\u201d I offer her _She_, by Rider Haggard.\n\u201cA _strange_ book, but full of hidden sense,\u201d I try to explain to her;\n\u201cthe eternal feminine, the immortality of our emotions\u2014\u2014\u201d Here she\ninterrupts me: \u201cI know that book already. Haven\u2019t you something of your\nown?\u201d \u201cNo, my own immortal works are still unwritten.\u201d \u201cWell, when are\nyou going to publish your so-called latest revelations which you\npromised us would be good reading?\u201d she asks somewhat sarcastically. I\nnow perceive that she is a mouthpiece for someone else, and I become\nsilent. I think of the effort it costs me to publish even my work on the\nDream, in which I have to surrender so much of my own intimate\ncharacter. \u201cThe best that you know you can\u2019t tell to the children.\u201d The\npreparation of _my own body_, which I am ordered to make in the dream,\nis thus the _self-analysis_ necessitated in the communication of my\ndreams. The elder Bruecke very properly finds a place here; in these\nfirst years of my scientific work it happened that I neglected a\ndiscovery, until his energetic commands forced me to publish it. But the\nother trains of thought which start from my conversation with Louise N.\ngo too deep to become conscious; they are side-tracked by way of the\nrelated material which has been awakened in me by the mention of Rider\nHaggard\u2019s _She_. The comment \u201cstrangely enough\u201d goes with this book, and\nwith another by the same author, _The Heart of the World_, and numerous\nelements of the dream are taken from these two fantastic novels. The\nmuddy ground over which the dreamer is carried, the chasm which must be\ncrossed by means of the boards that have been brought along, come from\n_She_; the Indians, the girl, and the wooden house, from the _Heart of\nthe World_. In both novels a woman is the leader, both treat of\ndangerous wanderings; _She_ has to do with an adventurous journey to the\nundiscovered country, a place almost untrodden by foot of man. According\nto a note which I find in my record of the dream, the fatigue in my legs\nwas a real sensation of those days. Doubtless in correspondence with\nthis came a tired frame of mind and the doubting question: \u201cHow much\nfurther will my legs carry me?\u201d The adventure in _She_ ends with the\nwoman leader\u2019s meeting her death in the mysterious fire at the centre of\nthe earth, instead of attaining immortality for herself and others. A\nfear of this sort has unmistakably arisen in the dream thoughts. The\n\u201cwooden house,\u201d also, is surely the coffin\u2014that is, the grave. But the\ndream activity has performed its masterpiece in representing this most\nunwished-for of all thoughts by means of a wish-fulfilment. I have\nalready once been in a grave, but it was an empty Etruscan grave near\nOrvieto\u2014a narrow chamber with two stone benches on the walls, upon which\nthe skeletons of two grown-up persons had been laid. The interior of the\nwooden house in the dream looks exactly like this, except that wood has\nbeen substituted for stone. The dream seems to say: \u201cIf you must so soon\nlie in your grave, let it be this Etruscan grave,\u201d and by means of this\ninterpolation it transforms the saddest expectation into one that is\nreally to be desired. As we shall learn, it is, unfortunately, only the\nidea accompanying an emotion which the dream can change into its\nopposite, not usually the emotion itself. Thus I awake with \u201cfrightened\nthoughts,\u201d even after the dream has been forced to represent my\nidea\u2014that perhaps the children will attain what has been denied to the\nfather\u2014a fresh allusion to the strange novel in which the identity of a\nperson is preserved through a series of generations covering two\nthousand years.\nVIII. In the context of another dream there is a similar expression of\nastonishment at what is experienced in the dream. This, however, is\nconnected with a striking and skilfully contrived attempt at explanation\nwhich might well be called a stroke of genius\u2014so that I should have to\nanalyse the whole dream merely for the sake of it, even if the dream did\nnot possess two other features of interest. I am travelling during the\nnight between the eighteenth and the nineteenth of July on the Southern\nRailway, and in my sleep I hear someone call out: _\u201cHollthurn, 10\nminutes.\u201d I immediately think of Holothurian\u2014of a museum of natural\nhistory\u2014that here is a place where brave men have vainly resisted the\ndomination of their overlord. Yes, the counter reformation in Austria!\nAs though it were a place in Styria or the Tyrol. Now I distinctly see a\nlittle museum in which the remains or the possessions of these men are\npreserved. I wish to get off, but I hesitate to do so. Women with fruit\nare standing on the platform; they crouch on the floor, and in that\nposition hold out their baskets in an inviting manner. I hesitate, in\ndoubt whether we still have time, but we are still standing. I am\nsuddenly in another compartment in which the leather and the seats are\nso narrow that one\u2019s back directly touches the back rest.[FC] I am\nsurprised at this, but I may have changed cars while asleep. Several\npeople, among them an English brother and sister; a row of books\ndistinctly on a shelf on the wall. I see_ The Wealth of Nations, _then_\nMatter and Motion (_by Maxwell_)\u2014_the books are thick and bound in brown\nlinen. The man asks his sister for a book by Schiller, and whether she\nhas forgotten it. These are books which first seem mine, then seem to\nbelong to the brother and sister. At this point I wish to join in the\nconversation in order to confirm and support what is being said\u2014\u2014._ I\nawaken sweating all over my body, because all the windows are shut. The\ntrain stops at Marburg.\nWhile writing down the dream, a part of it occurs to me which my memory\nwished to omit. _I say to the brother and sister about a certain work:\n\u201cIt is from ...\u201d but I correct myself: \u201cIt is by ...\u201d The man remarks to\nhis sister: \u201cHe said it correctly.\u201d_\nThe dream begins with the name of a station, which probably must have\npartially awakened me. For this name, which was Marburg, I substituted\nHollthurn. The fact that I heard Marburg when it was first called, or\nperhaps when it was called a second time, is proved by the mention in\nthe dream of Schiller, who was born in Marburg, though not in the one in\nStyria.[FD] Now this time, although I was travelling first-class, it was\nunder very disagreeable circumstances. The train was overcrowded; I had\nmet a gentleman and lady in my compartment who seemed persons of\nquality, but who did not have the good breeding or who did not think it\nworth while to conceal their displeasure at my intrusion. My polite\nsalutation was not answered, and although the man and the woman sat next\neach other (with their backs in the direction in which we were riding),\nthe woman made haste to pre-empt the place opposite her and next the\nwindow with her umbrella; the door was immediately closed and\ndemonstrative remarks about the opening of windows were exchanged.\nProbably I was quickly recognised as a person hungry for fresh air. It\nwas a hot night, and the air in the compartment, thus shut on all sides,\nwas almost suffocating. My experience as a traveller leads me to believe\nthat such inconsiderate, obtrusive conduct marks people who have only\npartly paid for their tickets, or not at all. When the conductor came,\nand I presented my dearly bought ticket, the lady called out\nungraciously, and as though threateningly: \u201cMy husband has a pass.\u201d She\nwas a stately figure with sour features, in age not far from the time\nset for the decay of feminine beauty; the man did not get a chance to\nsay anything at all, and sat there motionless. I tried to sleep. In the\ndream I take terrible revenge on my disagreeable travelling companions;\nno one would suspect what insults and humiliations are concealed behind\nthe disjointed fragments of the first half of the dream. After this\ndesire has been satisfied, the second wish, to exchange my compartment\nfor another, makes itself evident. The dream makes changes of scene so\noften, and without raising the least objection to such changes, that it\nwould not have been in the least remarkable if I had immediately\nreplaced my travelling companions by more pleasant ones for my\nrecollection. But this was one of the cases where something or other\nobjected to the change of scene and considered explanation of the change\nnecessary. How did I suddenly get into another compartment? I surely\ncould not remember having changed cars. So there was only one\nexplanation: _I must have left the carriage while asleep_, a rare\noccurrence, examples for which, however, are furnished by the experience\nof the neuropathologist. We know of persons who undertake railroad\njourneys in a crepuscular state without betraying their abnormal\ncondition by any sign, until some station on the journey they completely\nrecover consciousness, and are then surprised at the gap in their\nmemory. Thus, while I am still dreaming, I declare my own case to be\nsuch a one of \u201c_Automatisme ambulatoire_.\u201d\nAnalysis permits another solution. The attempt at explanation, which so\nastounds me if I am to attribute it to the dream activity, is not\noriginal, but is copied from the neurosis of one of my patients. I have\nalready spoken on another page of a highly cultured and, in conduct,\nkind-hearted man, who began, shortly after the death of his parents, to\naccuse himself of murderous inclinations, and who suffered because of\nthe precautionary measures he had to take to insure himself against\nthese inclinations. At first walking along the street was made painful\nfor him by the compulsion impelling him to demand an accounting of all\nthe persons he met as to whither they had vanished; if one of them\nsuddenly withdrew from his pursuing glance, there remained a painful\nfeeling and a thought of the possibility that he might have put the man\nout of the way. This compulsive idea concealed, among other things, a\nCain-fancy, for \u201call men are brothers.\u201d Owing to the impossibility of\naccomplishing his task, he gave up taking walks and spent his life\nimprisoned within his four walls. But news of murderous acts which have\nbeen committed outside constantly reached his room through the papers,\nand his conscience in the form of a doubt kept accusing him of being the\nmurderer. The certainty of not having left his dwelling for weeks\nprotected him against these accusations for a time, until one day there\ndawned upon him the possibility that he might have left _his house while\nin an unconscious condition_, and might thus have committed the murder\nwithout knowing anything about it. From that time on he locked his house\ndoor, and handed the key over to his old housekeeper, and strictly\nforbade her to give it into his hands even if he demanded it.\nThis, then, is the origin of the attempted explanation, that I may have\nchanged carriages while in an unconscious condition\u2014it has been\ntransferred from the material of the dream thoughts to the dream in a\nfinished state, and is obviously intended to identify me with the person\nof that patient. My memory of him was awakened by an easy association. I\nhad made my last night journey with this man a few weeks before. He was\ncured, and was escorting me into the country, to his relatives who were\nsummoning me; as we had a compartment to ourselves, we left all the\nwindows open through the night, and, as long as I had remained awake, we\nhad a delightful conversation. I knew that hostile impulses towards his\nfather from the time of his childhood, in connection with sexual\nmaterial, had been at the root of his illness. By identifying myself\nwith him, I wanted to make an analogous confession to myself. The second\nscene of the dream really resolves itself into a wanton fancy to the\neffect that my two elderly travelling companions had acted so uncivilly\ntowards me for the reason that my arrival prevented them from exchanging\nlove-tokens during the night as they had intended. This fancy, however,\ngoes back to an early childhood scene in which, probably impelled by\nsexual inquisitiveness, I intruded upon the bedroom of my parents, and\nwas driven from it by my father\u2019s emphatic command.\nI consider it superfluous to multiply further examples. All of them\nwould confirm what we have learned from those which have been already\ncited, namely, that an act of judgment in the dream is nothing but the\nrepetition of a prototype which it has in the dream thoughts. In most\ncases it is an inappropriate repetition introduced in an unfitting\nconnection; occasionally, however, as in our last example, it is so\nartfully disposed that it may give the impression of being an\nindependent thought activity in the dream. At this point we might turn\nour attention to that psychic activity which indeed does not seem to\nco-operate regularly in the formation of dreams, but whose effort it is,\nwherever it does co-operate, to fuse together those dream elements that\nare incongruent on account of their origins in an uncontradictory and\nintelligible manner. We consider it best, however, first to take up the\nexpressions of emotion which appear in the dream, and to compare them\nwith the emotions which analysis reveals to us in the dream thoughts.\n(_g_) _The Affects in the Dream._\nA profound remark of Stricker\u2019s[77] has called our attention to the fact\nthat the expressions of emotion in the dream do not permit of being\ndisposed of in the slighting manner in which we are accustomed to shake\noff the dream itself, after we have awakened. \u201cIf I am afraid of robbers\nin the dream, the robbers, to be sure, are imaginary, but the fear of\nthem is real,\u201d and the same is true if I am glad in the dream. According\nto the testimony of our feelings, the emotion experienced in the dream\nis in no way less valid than one of like intensity experienced in waking\nlife, and the dream makes its claim to be taken up as a part of our real\nmental experiences, more energetically on account of its emotional\ncontent than on account of its ideal content. We do not succeed in\naccomplishing this separation in waking life, because we do not know how\nto estimate an emotion psychically except in connection with a\npresentation content. If in kind or in intensity an affect and an idea\nare incongruous, our waking judgment becomes confused.\nThe fact that in dreams the presentation content does not entail the\naffective influence which we should expect as necessary in waking\nthought has always caused astonishment. Str\u00fcmpell was of the opinion\nthat ideas in the dream are stripped of their psychic values. But\nneither does the dream lack opposite instances, where the expression of\nintense affect appears in a content, which seems to offer no occasion\nfor its development. I am in a horrible, dangerous, or disgusting\nsituation in the dream, but I feel nothing of fear or aversion; on the\nother hand, I am sometimes terrified at harmless things and glad at\nchildish ones.\nThis enigma of the dream disappears more suddenly and more completely\nthan perhaps any other of the dream problems, if we pass from the\nmanifest to the latent content. We shall then no longer be concerned to\nexplain it, for it will no longer exist. Analysis teaches us _that\npresentation contents have undergone displacements and substitutions,\nwhile affects have remained unchanged_. No wonder, then, that the\npresentation content which has been altered by dream disfigurement no\nlonger fits the affect that has remained intact; but there is no cause\nfor wonder either after analysis has put the correct content in its\nformer place.\nIn a psychic complex which has been subjected to the influence of the\nresisting censor the affects are the unyielding constituent, which alone\nis capable of guiding us to a correct supplementation. This state of\naffairs is revealed in psychoneuroses even more distinctly than in the\ndream. Here the affect is always in the right, at least as far as its\nquality goes; its intensity may even be increased by means of a\ndisplacement of neurotic attention. If a hysteric is surprised that he\nis so very afraid of a trifle, or if the patient with compulsive ideas\nis astonished that he develops such painful self-reproach out of a\nnonentity, both of them err in that they regard the presentation\ncontent\u2014the trifle or the nonentity\u2014as the essential thing, and they\ndefend themselves in vain because they make this presentation content\nthe starting point in their thought. Psychoanalysis, however, shows them\nthe right way by recognising that, on the contrary, the affect is\njustified, and by searching for the presentation which belongs to it and\nwhich has been suppressed by means of replacement. The assumption is\nhere made that the development of affect and the presentation content do\nnot constitute such an indissoluble organic union as we are accustomed\nto think, but that the two parts may be, so to speak, soldered together\nin such a way that they may be detached from one another by means of\nanalysis. Dream interpretation shows that this is actually the case.\nI give first an example in which analysis explains the apparent absence\nof affect in a presentation content which ought to force a development\nof emotion.\nI. _The dreamer sees three lions in a desert, one of which is laughing,\nbut she is not afraid of them. Then, however, she must have fled from\nthem, for she is trying to climb a tree, but she finds that her cousin,\nwho is a teacher of French, is already up in the tree, &c._\nThe analysis gives us the following material for this dream: A sentence\nin the dreamer\u2019s English lesson had become the indifferent occasion for\nit: \u201cThe _lion\u2019s_ greatest beauty is his mane.\u201d Her father wore a beard\nwhich surrounded his face like a mane. The name of her English teacher\nwas Miss _Lyons_. An acquaintance of hers had sent her the ballads of\n_Loewe_ (German, Loewe\u2014lion). These, then, are the three lions; why\nshould she have been afraid of them? She has read a story in which a\nnegro who has incited his fellows to revolt is hunted with bloodhounds\nand climbs a tree to save himself. Then follow fragments in wanton mood,\nlike the following. Directions for catching lions from _Die Fliegende\nBlaetter_: \u201cTake a desert and strain it; the lions will remain.\u201d Also a\nvery amusing, but not very proper anecdote about an official who is\nasked why he does not take greater pains to win the favour of his\nsuperior officer, and who answers that he has been trying to insinuate\nhimself, but that the man ahead of him _is already up_. The whole matter\nbecomes intelligible as soon as one learns that on the day of the dream\nthe lady had received a visit from her husband\u2019s superior. He was very\npolite to her, kissed her hand, and _she was not afraid of him at all_,\nalthough he is a \u201cbig bug\u201d (German\u2014_Grosses Tier_ = \u201cbig animal\u201d) and\nplays the part of a \u201csocial lion\u201d in the capital of her country. This\nlion is, therefore, like the lion in the _Midsummer Night\u2019s Dream_, who\nunmasks as Snug, the joiner, and of such stuff are all dream lions made\nwhen one is not afraid.\nII. As my second example, I cite the dream of the girl who saw her\nsister\u2019s little son lying dead in a coffin, but who, I may now add, felt\nno pain or sorrow thereat. We know from analysis why not. The dream only\nconcealed her wish to see the man she loved again; the affect must be\nattuned to the wish, and not to its concealment. There was no occasion\nfor sorrow at all.\nIn a number of dreams the emotion at least remains connected with that\npresentation content which has replaced the one really belonging to it.\nIn others the breaking up of the complex is carried further. The affect\nseems to be entirely separated from the idea belonging to it, and finds\na place somewhere else in the dream where it fits into the new\narrangement of the dream elements. This is similar to what we have\nlearned of acts of judgment of the dream. If there is a significant\ninference in the dream thoughts, the dream also contains one; but in the\ndream the inference may be shifted to entirely different material. Not\ninfrequently this shifting takes place according to the principle of\nantithesis.\nI illustrate the latter possibility by the following dream, which I have\nsubjected to the most exhaustive analysis.\nIII. _A castle by the sea; afterwards it lies not directly on the sea,\nbut on a narrow canal that leads to the sea. A certain Mr. P. is the\ngovernor of it. I stand with him in a large salon with three windows, in\nfront of which rise the projections of a wall, like battlements of a\nfort. I belong to the garrison, perhaps as a volunteer marine officer.\nWe fear the arrival of hostile warships, for we are in a state of war.\nMr. P. has the intention of leaving; he gives me instructions as to what\nmust be done in case the dreaded event happens. His sick wife is in the\nthreatened castle with her children. As soon as the bombardment begins\nthe large hall should be cleared. He breathes heavily, and tries to get\naway; I hold him back, and ask him in what way I should send him news in\ncase of need. He says something else, and then all at once falls over\ndead. I have probably taxed him unnecessarily with my questions. After\nhis death, which makes no further impression upon me, I think whether\nthe widow is to remain in the castle, whether I should give notice of\nthe death to the commander-in-chief, and whether I should take over the\ndirection of the castle as the next in command. I now stand at the\nwindow, and muster the ships as they pass by; they are merchantmen that\ndart past upon the dark water, several of them with more than one\nsmokestack, others with bulging decks_ (that are quite similar to the\nrailway stations in the preliminary dream which has not been told).\n_Then my brother stands next to me, and both of us look out of the\nwindow on to the canal. At the sight of a ship we are frightened, and\ncall out: \u201cHere comes the warship!\u201d It turns out, however, that it is\nonly the same ships which I have already known that are returning. Now\ncomes a little ship, strangely cut off, so that it ends in the middle of\nits breadth; curious things like cups or salt-cellars are seen on the\ndeck. We call as though with one voice: \u201cThat is the breakfast-ship.\u201d_\nThe rapid motion of the ships, the deep blue of the water, the brown\nsmoke of the funnels, all this together makes a highly tense, sombre\nimpression.\nThe localities in this dream are put together from several journeys to\nthe Adriatic Sea (Miramare, Duino, Venice, Aquileja). A short but\nenjoyable Easter trip to Aquileja with my brother, a few weeks before\nthe dream, was still fresh in my memory. Besides, the naval war between\nAmerica and Spain, and the worry connected with it about my relatives\nliving in America, play a part. Manifestations of emotion appear at two\nplaces in this dream. In one place an emotion that would be expected is\nlacking\u2014it is expressly emphasized that the death of the governor makes\nno impression upon me; at another point, where I see the warships I am\n_frightened_, and experience all the sensations of fright while I sleep.\nThe distribution of affects in this well-constructed dream has been made\nin such a way that every obvious contradiction is avoided. For there is\nno reason why I should be frightened at the governor\u2019s death, and it is\nfitting that as the commander of the castle I should be alarmed by the\nsight of the warship. Now analysis shows that Mr. P. is nothing but a\nsubstitute for my own Ego (in the dream I am his substitute). I am the\ngovernor who suddenly dies. The dream thoughts deal with the future of\nthose dear to me after my premature death. No other disagreeable thought\nis to be found among the dream thoughts. The fright which is attached to\nthe sight of the warship must be transferred from it to this\ndisagreeable thought. Inversely, the analysis shows that the region of\nthe dream thoughts from which the warship comes is filled with most\njoyous reminiscences. It was at Venice a year before, one charmingly\nbeautiful day, that we stood at the windows of our room on the Riva\nSchiavoni and looked upon the blue lagoon, in which more activity could\nbe seen that day than usually. English ships were being expected, they\nwere to be festively received; and suddenly my wife called out, happy as\na child: \u201c_There come the English warships!_\u201d In the dream I am\nfrightened at the very same words; we see again that speeches in the\ndream originate from speeches in life. I shall soon show that even the\nelement \u201cEnglish\u201d in this speech has not been lost for the dream\nactivity. I thus convert joy into fright on the way from the dream\nthoughts to the dream content, and I need only intimate that by means of\nthis very transformation I give expression to a part of the latent dream\ncontent. The example shows, however, that the dream activity is at\nliberty to detach the occasion for an affect from its context in the\ndream thoughts, and to insert it at any other place it chooses in the\ndream content.\nI seize the opportunity which is incidentally offered, of subjecting to\ncloser analysis the \u201cbreakfast ship,\u201d whose appearance in the dream so\nnonsensically concludes a situation that has been rationally adhered to.\nIf I take a closer view of this object in the dream, I am now struck by\nthe fact that it was black, and that on account of its being cut off at\nits greatest breadth it closely resembled, at the end where it was cut\noff, an object which had aroused our interest in the museums of the\nEtruscan cities. This object was a rectangular cup of black clay with\ntwo handles, upon which stood things like coffee cups, or tea cups, very\nsimilar to our modern _breakfast_ table service. Upon inquiring, we\nlearned that this was the toilet set of an Etruscan lady, with little\nboxes for rouge and powder; and we said jokingly to each other that it\nwould not be a bad idea to take a thing like that home to the lady of\nthe house. The dream object, therefore, signifies \u201c_black toilet_\u201d\n(German, _toilette_\u2014dress)\u2014mourning\u2014and has direct reference to a death.\nThe other end of the dream object reminds us of the \u201cboat\u201d (German,\n_Nachen_), from the root \u03bd\u03ad\u03c7\u03c5\u03c2, as a philological friend has told me,\nupon which corpses were laid in prehistoric times and were left to be\nburied by the sea. With this circumstance is connected the reason for\nthe return of the ships in the dream.\n\u201cQuietly the old man on his rescued boat drifts into the harbour.\u201d\nIt is the return voyage after the ship_wreck_ (German, schiff_bruch_;\nship-_breaking_, _i.e._ shipwreck), the breakfast-ship looks as though\nit were _broken_ off in the middle. But whence comes the name\n\u201cbreakfast\u201d-ship? Here is where the \u201cEnglish\u201d comes in, which we have\nleft over from the warships. _Breakfast\u2014a breaking of the fast._\nBreaking again belongs to ship-_wreck_ (Schiff_bruch_), and _fasting_ is\nconnected with the mourning dress.\nThe only thing about this breakfast-ship, which has been newly created\nby the dream, is its name. The thing has existed in reality, and recalls\nto me the merriest hours of my last journey. As we distrusted the fare\nin Aquileja, we took some food with us from Goerz, and bought a bottle\nof excellent Istrian wine in Aquileja, and while the little mail-steamer\nslowly travelled through the Canal delle Mee and into the lonely stretch\nof lagoon towards Grado, we took our breakfast on deck\u2014we were the only\npassengers\u2014and it tasted to us as few breakfasts have ever tasted. This,\nthen, was the \u201c_breakfast-ship_,\u201d and it is behind this very\nrecollection of great enjoyment that the dream hides the saddest\nthoughts about an unknown and ominous future.\nThe detachment of emotions from the groups of ideas which have been\nresponsible for their development is the most striking thing that\nhappens to them in the course of dream formation, but it is neither the\nonly nor even the most essential change which they undergo on the way\nfrom the dream thoughts to the manifest dream. If the affects in the\ndream thoughts are compared with those in the dream, it at once becomes\nclear that wherever there is an emotion in the dream, this is also to be\nfound in the dream thoughts; the converse, however, is not true. In\ngeneral, the dream is less rich in affects than the psychic material\nfrom which it is elaborated. As soon as I have reconstructed the dream\nthoughts I see that the most intense psychic impulses are regularly\nstriving in them for self-assertion, usually in conflict with others\nthat are sharply opposed to them. If I turn back to the dream, I often\nfind it colourless and without any of the more intense strains of\nfeeling. Not only the content, but also the affective tone of my\nthoughts has been brought by the dream activity to the level of the\nindifferent. I might say that a _suppression of the affects_ has taken\nplace. Take, for example, the dream of the botanical monograph. It\nanswers to a passionate plea for my freedom to act as I am acting and to\narrange my life as seems right to me and to me alone. The dream which\nresults from it sounds indifferent; I have written a monograph; it is\nlying before me; it is fitted with coloured plates, and dried plants are\nto be found with each copy. It is like the peacefulness of a\nbattlefield; there is no trace left of the tumult of battle.\nIt may also turn out differently\u2014vivid affective expressions may make\ntheir appearance in the dream; but we shall first dwell upon the\nunquestionable fact that many dreams appear indifferent, while it is\nnever possible to go deeply into the dream thoughts without deep\nemotion.\nA complete theoretical explanation of this suppression of emotions in\nthe course of the dream activity cannot be given here; it would require\na most careful investigation of the theory of the emotions and of the\nmechanism of suppression. I shall find a place here for two thoughts\nonly. I am forced\u2014on other grounds\u2014to conceive the development of\naffects as a centrifugal process directed towards the interior of the\nbody, analogous to the processes of motor and secretory innervation.\nJust as in the sleeping condition the omission of motor impulses towards\nthe outside world seems to be suspended, so a centrifugal excitement of\nemotions through unconscious thought may be made more difficult during\nsleep. Thus the affective impulses aroused during the discharge of the\ndream thoughts would themselves be weak excitements, and therefore those\ngetting into the dream would not be stronger. According to this line of\nargument the \u201csuppression of the affects\u201d would not be a result of the\ndream activity at all, but a result of the sleeping condition. This may\nbe so, but this cannot possibly be all. We must also remember that all\nthe more complex dreams have shown themselves to be a compromised result\nfrom the conflict of psychic forces. On the one hand, the thoughts that\nconstitute the wish must fight the opposition of a censorship; on the\nother hand, we have often seen how, even in unconscious thinking, each\ntrain of thought is harnessed to its contradictory opposite. Since all\nof these trains of thought are capable of emotion, we shall hardly make\na mistake, broadly speaking, if we regard the suppression of emotion as\nthe result of the restraint which the contrasts impose upon one another\nand which the censor imposes upon the tendencies which it has\nsuppressed. _The restraint of affects would accordingly he the second\nresult of the dream censor as the disfigurement of the dream was the\nfirst._\nI shall insert an example of a dream in which the indifferent affective\ntone of the dream content may be explained by a contrast in the dream\nthoughts. I have the following short dream to relate, which every reader\nwill read with disgust:\nIV. _A bit of rising ground, and on it something like a toilet in the\nopen; a very long bench, at the end of which is a large toilet aperture.\nAll of the back edge is thickly covered with little heaps of excrement\nof all sizes and degrees of freshness. A shrub behind the bench. I\nurinate upon the bench; a long stream of urine rinses everything clean,\nthe patches of excrement easily come off and fall into the opening. It\nseems as though something remained at the end nevertheless._\nWhy did I experience no disgust in this dream?\nBecause, as the analysis shows, the most pleasant and satisfying\nthoughts have co-operated in the formation of this dream. Upon analysing\nit I immediately think of the Augean stables cleansed by Hercules. I am\nthis Hercules. The rising ground and the shrub belong to Aussee, where\nmy children are now staying. I have discovered the infantile etiology of\nthe neuroses and have thus guarded my own children from becoming ill.\nThe bench (omitting the aperture, of course) is the faithful copy of a\npiece of furniture which an affectionate female patient has made me a\npresent of. This recalls how my patients honour me. Even the museum of\nhuman excrement is susceptible of less disagreeable interpretation.\nHowever much I am disgusted with it, it is a souvenir of the beautiful\nland of Italy, where in little cities, as everyone knows, water-closets\nare not equipped in any other way. The stream of urine that washes\neverything clean is an unmistakable allusion to greatness. It is in this\nmanner that Gulliver extinguishes the great fire in Lilliput; to be\nsure, he thereby incurs the displeasure of the tiniest of queens. In\nthis way, too, Gargantua, the superman in Master Rabelais, takes\nvengeance upon the Parisians, straddling Notre Dame and training his\nstream of urine upon the city. Only yesterday I was turning over the\nleaves of Garnier\u2019s illustrations of Rabelais before I went to bed. And,\nstrangely enough, this is another proof that I am the superman! The\nplatform of Notre Dame was my favourite nook in Paris; every free\nafternoon I was accustomed to go up into the towers of the church and\nclimb about among the monsters and devil-masks there. The circumstances\nthat all the excrement vanishes so rapidly before the stream correspond\nto the motto: _Afflavit et dissipati sunt_, which I shall some day make\nthe title of a chapter on the therapeutics of hysteria.\nAnd now as to the occasion giving rise to the dream. It had been a hot\nafternoon in summer; in the evening I had given a lecture on the\nrelation between hysteria and the perversions, and everything which I\nhad to say displeased me thoroughly, appeared to me stripped of all\nvalue. I was tired, found no trace of pleasure in my difficult task, and\nlonged to get away from this rummaging in human filth, to see my\nchildren and then the beauties of Italy. In this mood I went from the\nauditorium to a caf\u00e9, to find some modest refreshment in the open air,\nfor my appetite had left me. But one of my audience went with me; he\nbegged for permission to sit with me while I drank my coffee and gulped\ndown my roll, and began to say flattering things to me. He told me how\nmuch he had learned from me, and that he now looked at everything\nthrough different eyes, that I had cleansed the Augean stables, _i.e._\nthe theory of the neuroses, of its errors and prejudices\u2014in short, that\nI was a very great man. My mood was ill-suited to his song of praise; I\nstruggled with disgust, and went home earlier in order to extricate\nmyself. Before I went to sleep I turned over the leaves of Rabelais, and\nread a short story by C. F. Meyer entitled _Die Leiden eines Knaben_\n(The Hardships of a Boy).\nThe dream had been drawn from these materials, and the novel by Meyer\nadded the recollection of childish scenes (_cf._ the dream about Count\nThun, last scene). The mood of the day, characterised by disgust and\nannoyance, is continued in the dream in the sense that it is permitted\nto furnish nearly the entire material for the dream content. But during\nthe night the opposite mood of vigorous and even exaggerated\nself-assertion was awakened, and dissipated the earlier mood. The dream\nhad to take such a form as to accommodate the expression of\nself-depreciation and exaggerated self-assertion in the same material.\nThis compromise formation resulted in an ambiguous dream content, but\nlikewise in an indifferent strain of feeling owing to the restraint of\nthe contrasts upon each other.\nAccording to the theory of wish-fulfilment this dream could not have\nhappened had not the suppressed, but at the same time pleasurable, train\nof thought concerning personal aggrandisement been coupled with the\nopposing thoughts of disgust. For disagreeable things are not intended\nto be represented by the dream; painful thoughts that have occurred\nduring the day can force their way into the dream only if they lend a\ncloak to the wish-fulfilment. The dream activity can dispose of the\naffects in the dream thoughts in still another way, besides admitting\nthem or reducing them to zero. _It can change them into their opposite._\nWe have already become acquainted with the rule of interpretation that\nevery element of the dream may be interpreted by its opposite, as well\nas by itself. One can never tell at the outset whether to set down the\none or the other; only the connection can decide this point. A suspicion\nof this state of affairs has evidently got into popular consciousness;\ndream books very often proceed according to the principle of contraries\nin their interpretation. Such transformation into opposites is made\npossible by the intimate concatenation of associations, which in our\nthoughts finds the idea of a thing in that of its opposite. Like every\nother displacement this serves the purposes of the censor, but it is\nalso often the work of the wish-fulfilment, for wish-fulfilment consists\nprecisely in this substitution of an unwelcome thing by its opposite.\nThe emotions of the dream thoughts may appear in the dream transformed\ninto their opposites just as well as the ideas, and it is probable that\nthis inversion of emotions is usually brought about by the dream censor.\nThe _suppression_ and _inversion of affects_ are useful in social life,\nas the current analogy for the dream censor has shown us\u2014above all, for\npurposes of dissimulation. If I converse with a person to whom I must\nshow consideration while I am saying unpleasant things to him, it is\nalmost more important that I should conceal the expression of my emotion\nfrom him, than that I modify the wording of my thoughts. If I speak to\nhim in polite words, but accompany them by looks or gestures of hatred\nand disdain, the effect which I produce upon this person is not very\ndifferent from what it would have been if I had recklessly thrown my\ncontempt into his face. Above all, then, the censor bids me suppress my\nemotions, and if I am master of the art of dissimulation, I can\nhypocritically show the opposite emotion\u2014smiling where I should like to\nbe angry, and pretending affection where I should like to destroy.\nWe already know of an excellent example of such an inversion of emotion\nfor the purposes of the dream censor. In the dream about my uncle\u2019s\nbeard I feel great affection for my friend R., at the same time that,\nand because, the dream thoughts berate him as a simpleton. We have drawn\nour first proof for the existence of the censor from this example of the\ninversion of emotions. Nor is it necessary here to assume that the dream\nactivity creates a counter emotion of this kind out of nothing; it\nusually finds it lying ready in the material of the dream thoughts, and\nintensifies it solely with the psychic force of the resisting impulse\nuntil a point is reached where the emotion can be won over for the\nformation of the dream. In the dream of my uncle, just mentioned, the\naffectionate counter emotion has probably originated from an infantile\nsource (as the continuation of the dream would suggest), for the\nrelation between uncle and nephew has become the source of all my\nfriendships and hatreds, owing to the peculiar nature of my childish\nexperiences (_cf._ analysis on p. 334).\nThere is a class of dreams deserving the designation \u201chypocritical,\u201d\nwhich puts the theory of wish-fulfilment to a severe test. My attention\nwas called to them when Mrs. Dr. M. Hilferding brought up for discussion\nin the Vienna Psychoanalytic Society the dream reported by Rosegger,\nwhich is reprinted below.\nIn _Waldheimat_, vol. xi., Rosegger writes as follows in his story,\n_Fremd gemacht_, p. 303:\n\u201cI have usually enjoyed healthful sleep, but I have lost the rest of\nmany a night. With my modest existence as a student and literary man,\nI have for long years dragged along with me the shadow of a veritable\ntailor\u2019s life, like a ghost from which I could not become separated. I\ncannot say that I have occupied myself so often and so vividly with\nthoughts of my past during the day. An assailer of heaven and earth\narising from the skin of the Philistine has other things to think\nabout. Nor did I, as a dashing young fellow, think about my nocturnal\ndreams; only later, when I got into the habit of thinking about\neverything or when the Philistine within me again asserted itself, it\nstruck me that whenever I dreamed I was always the journeyman tailor,\nand was always working in my master\u2019s shop for long hours without any\nremuneration. As I sat there and sewed and pressed I was quite aware\nthat I no longer belonged there, and that as a burgess of a town I had\nother things to attend to; but I was for ever having vacations, and\ngoing out into the country, and it was then that I sat near my boss\nand assisted him. I often felt badly, and regretted the loss of time\nwhich I might spend for better and more useful purposes. If something\ndid not come up to the measure and cut exactly, I had to submit to a\nreproach from the boss. Often, as I sat with my back bent in the dingy\nshop, I decided to give notice that I was going to quit. On one\noccasion I actually did so, but the boss took no notice of it, and the\nnext time I was again sitting near him and sewing.\n\u201cHow happy I was when I woke up after such weary hours! And I then\nresolved that, if this dream came intruding again, I would throw it\noff with energy and would cry aloud: \u2018It is only a delusion, I am in\nbed, and I want to sleep.\u2019... And the next night I would be sitting in\nthe tailor shop again.\n\u201cThus years passed with dismal regularity. While the boss and I were\nworking at Alpelhofer\u2019s, at the house of the peasant where I began my\napprenticeship, it happened that he was particularly dissatisfied with\nmy work. \u2018I should like to know where in the world your thoughts are?\u2019\ncried he, and looked at me gloomily, I thought the most sensible thing\nfor me to do would be to get up and explain to the boss that I was\nwith him only as a favour, and then leave. But I did not do this. I\nsubmitted, however, when the boss engaged an apprentice, and ordered\nme to make room for him on the bench. I moved into the corner, and\nkept on sewing. On the same day another tailor was engaged; he was\nbigoted, as he was a Czech who had worked for us nineteen years\nbefore, and then had fallen into the lake on his way home from the\npublic-house. When he tried to sit down there was no room for him. I\nlooked at the boss inquiringly, and he said to me, \u2018You have no talent\nfor the tailoring business; you may go; you are free.\u2019 My fright on\nthat occasion was so overpowering that I awoke.\n\u201cThe morning gray glimmered through the clear window of my beloved\nhome. Objects of art surrounded me; in the tasteful bookcase stood the\neternal Homer, the gigantic Dante, the incomparable Shakespeare, the\nglorious Goethe\u2014all shining and immortal. From the adjoining room\nresounded the clear little voices of the children, who were waking and\nprattling with their mother. I felt as if I had found again that\nidyllically sweet, that peaceful, poetical, and spiritual life which I\nhave so often and so deeply conceived as the contemplative fortune of\nmankind. And still I was vexed that I had not given my boss notice\nfirst, instead of allowing him to discharge me.\n\u201cAnd how remarkable it is; after the night when the boss \u2018discharged\nme\u2019 I enjoyed rest; I no longer dreamed of my tailoring\u2014of this\nexperience which lay in the remote past, which in its simplicity was\nreally happy, and which, nevertheless, threw a long shadow over the\nlater years of my life.\u201d\nI. In this dream, the series of the poet who, in his younger years, has\nbeen a journeyman tailor, it is hard to recognise the domination of the\nwish-fulfilment. All the delightful things occurred during the waking\nstate, while the dream seemed to drag along the ghostlike shadow of an\nunhappy existence which had been long forgotten. My own dreams of a\nsimilar nature have put me in a position to give some explanation for\nsuch dreams. As a young doctor I for a long time worked in the chemical\ninstitute without being able to accomplish anything in that exacting\nscience, and I therefore never think in my waking state about this\nunfruitful episode in my life, of which I am really ashamed. On the\nother hand, it has become a recurring dream with me that I am working in\nthe laboratory, making analyses, and having experiences there, &c.; like\nthe examination dreams, these dreams are disagreeable, and they are\nnever very distinct. During the analysis of one of these dreams my\nattention was directed to the word \u201canalysis,\u201d which, gave me the key to\nan understanding of these dreams. For I had since become an \u201canalyst.\u201d I\nmake analyses which are highly praised\u2014to be sure, psychoanalyses. I\nthen understood that when I grew proud of these analyses of the waking\nstate, and wanted to boast how much I had accomplished thereby, the\ndream would hold up to me at night those other unsuccessful analyses of\nwhich I had no reason to be proud; they are the punitive dreams of the\nupstart, like those of the tailor who became a celebrated poet. But how\nis it possible for the dream to place itself at the service of\nself-criticism in its conflict with parvenu-pride, and to take as its\ncontent a rational warning instead of the fulfilment of a prohibitive\nwish? I have already mentioned that the answer to this question entails\nmany difficulties. We may conclude that the foundation of the dream was\nat first formed by a phantasy of overweening ambition, but that only its\nsuppression and its abashment reached the dream content in its stead.\nOne should remember that there are masochistic tendencies in the psychic\nlife to which such an inversion might be attributed. But a more thorough\ninvestigation of the individual dreams allows the recognition of still\nanother element. In an indistinct subordinate portion of one of my\nlaboratory dreams, I was just at the age which placed me in the most\ngloomy and most unsuccessful year of my professional career; I still had\nno position and no means of support, when I suddenly found that I had\nthe choice of many women whom I could marry! I was, therefore, young\nagain, and, what is more, she was young again\u2014the woman who has shared\nwith me all these hard years. In this way one of the wishes which\nconstantly frets the heart of the ageing man was revealed as the\nunconscious dream inciter. The struggle raging in the other psychic\nstrata between vanity and self-criticism has certainly determined the\ndream content, but the more deeply-rooted wish of youth has alone made\nit possible as a dream. One may say to himself even in the waking state:\nTo be sure it is very nice now, and times were once very hard; but it\nwas nice, too, even then, you were still so young.\nIn considering dreams reported by a poet one may often assume that he\nhas excluded from the report those details which he perceived as\ndisturbing and which he considered unessential. His dreams, then, give\nus a riddle which could be readily solved if we had an exact\nreproduction of the dream content.\nO. Rank has called my attention to the fact that in Grimm\u2019s fairy tale\nof the valiant little tailor, or \u201cSeven at one Stroke,\u201d a very similar\ndream of an upstart is related. The tailor, who became the hero and\nmarried the king\u2019s daughter, dreamed one night while with the princess,\nhis wife, about his trade; the latter, becoming suspicious, ordered\narmed guards for the following night, who should listen to what was\nspoken in the dream, and who should do away with the dreamer. But the\nlittle tailor was warned, and knew enough to correct his dream.\nThe complex of processes\u2014of suspension, subtraction, and\ninversion\u2014through which the affects of the dream thoughts finally become\nthose of the dream, may well be observed in the suitable synthesis of\ncompletely analysed dreams. I shall here treat a few cases of emotional\nexcitement in the dream which furnish examples of some of the cases\ndiscussed.\nIn the dream about the odd task which the elder Bruecke gives me to\nperform\u2014of preparing my own pelvis\u2014the _appropriate horror is absent in\nthe dream itself_. Now this is a wish-fulfilment in various senses.\nPreparation signifies self-analysis, which I accomplish, as it were, by\npublishing my book on dreams, and which has been so disagreeable to me\nthat I have already postponed printing the finished manuscript for more\nthan a year. The wish is now actuated that I may disregard this feeling\nof opposition, and for that reason I feel no horror (_Grauen_, which\nalso means to grow grey) in the dream. I should also like to escape the\nhorror\u2014in the other (German) sense\u2014of growing grey; for I am already\ngrowing grey fast, and the grey in my hair warns me withal to hold back\nno longer. For we know that at the end of the dream the thought secures\nexpression in that I should have to leave my children to get to the goal\nof their difficult journey.\nIn the two dreams that shift the expression of satisfaction to the\nmoments immediately after awakening, this satisfaction is in the one\ncase motivated by the expectation that I am now going to learn what is\nmeant by \u201cI have already dreamed of it,\u201d and refers in reality to the\nbirth of my first child, and in the other case it is motivated by the\nconviction that \u201cthat which has been announced by a sign\u201d is now going\nto happen, and the latter satisfaction is the same which I felt at the\narrival of my second son. Here the same emotions that dominated in the\ndream thoughts have remained in the dream, but the process is probably\nnot so simple as this in every dream. If the two analyses are examined a\nlittle, it will be seen that this satisfaction which does not succumb to\nthe censor receives an addition from a source which must fear the\ncensor; and the emotion drawn from this source would certainly arouse\nopposition if it did not cloak itself in a similar emotion of\nsatisfaction that is willingly admitted, if it did not, as it were,\nsneak in behind the other. Unfortunately, I am unable to show this in\nthe case of the actual dream specimen, but an example from another\nprovince will make my meaning intelligible. I construct the following\ncase: Let there be a person near me whom I hate so that a strong feeling\narises in me that I should be glad if something were to happen to him.\nBut the moral part of my nature does not yield to this sentiment; I do\nnot dare to express this ill-wish, and when something happens to him\nwhich he does not deserve, I suppress my satisfaction at it, and force\nmyself to expressions and thoughts of regret. Everyone will have found\nhimself in such a position. But now let it happen that the hated person\ndraws upon himself a well-deserved misfortune by some fault; now I may\ngive free rein to my satisfaction that he has been visited by a just\npunishment, and I express opinion in the matter which coincides with\nthat of many other people who are impartial. But I can see that my\nsatisfaction turns out to be more intense than that of the others, for\nit has received an addition from another source\u2014from my hatred, which\nhas hitherto been prevented by the inner censor from releasing an\nemotion, but which is no longer prevented from doing so under the\naltered circumstances. This case is generally typical of society, where\npersons who have aroused antipathy or are adherents of an unpopular\nminority incur guilt. Their punishment does not correspond to their\ntransgression but to their transgression _plus_ the ill-will directed\nagainst them that has hitherto been ineffective. Those who execute the\npunishment doubtless commit an injustice, but they are prevented from\nbecoming aware of it by the satisfaction arising from the release within\nthemselves of a suppression of long standing. In such cases the emotion\nis justified according to its quality, but not according to its\nquantity; and the self-criticism that has been appeased as to the one\npoint is only too ready to neglect examination of the second point. Once\nyou have opened the doors, more people get through than you originally\nintended to admit.\nThe striking feature of the neurotic character, that incitements capable\nof producing emotion bring about a result that is qualitatively\njustified but is quantitatively excessive, is to be explained in this\nmanner, in so far as it admits of a psychological explanation at all.\nThe excess is due to sources of emotion which have remained unconscious\nand have hitherto been suppressed, which can establish in the\nassociations a connection with the actual incitement, and which can thus\nfind release for its emotions through the vent which the unobjectionable\nand admitted source of emotion opens. Our attention is thus called to\nthe fact that we may not consider the relation of mutual restraint as\nobtaining exclusively between the suppressed and the suppressing psychic\njudgment. The cases in which the two judgments bring about a\npathological emotion by co-operation and mutual strengthening deserve\njust as much attention. The reader is requested to apply these hints\nregarding the psychic mechanism for the purpose of understanding the\nexpressions of emotion in the dream. A satisfaction which makes its\nappearance in the dream, and which may readily be found at its proper\nplace in the dream thoughts, may not always be fully explained by means\nof this reference. As a rule it will be necessary to search for a second\nsource in the dream thoughts, upon which the pressure of the censor is\nexerted, and which under the pressure would have resulted not in\nsatisfaction, but in the opposite emotion\u2014which, however, is enabled by\nthe presence of the first source to free its satisfaction affect from\nsuppression and to reinforce the satisfaction springing from the other\nsource. Hence emotions in the dream appear as though formed by the\nconfluence of several tributaries, and as though over-determined in\nreference to the material of the dream thoughts; _sources of affect\nwhich can furnish the same affect join each other in the dream activity\nin order to produce it_.[FE]\nSome insight into these tangled relations is gained from analysis of the\nadmirable dream in which \u201cNon vixit\u201d constitutes the central point\n(_cf._ p. 333). The expressions of emotion in this dream, which are of\ndifferent qualities, are forced together at two points in the manifest\ncontent. Hostile and painful feelings (in the dream itself we have the\nphrase, \u201cseized by strange emotions\u201d) overlap at the point where I\ndestroy my antagonistic friend with the two words. At the end of the\ndream I am greatly pleased, and am quite ready to believe in a\npossibility which I recognise as absurd when I am awake, namely, that\nthere are _revenants_ who can be put out of the way by a mere wish.\nI have not yet mentioned the occasion for this dream. It is an\nessential one, and goes a long way towards explaining it. I had\nreceived the news from my friend in Berlin (whom I have designated as\nF.) that he is about to undergo an operation and that relatives of his\nliving in Vienna would give me information about his condition. The\nfirst few messages after the operation were not reassuring, and caused\nme anxiety. I should have liked best to go to him myself, but at that\ntime I was affected with a painful disease which made every movement a\ntorture for me. I learn from the dream thoughts that I feared for the\nlife of my dear friend. I knew that his only sister, with whom I had\nnot been acquainted, had died early after the shortest possible\nillness. (In the dream _F. tells about his sister, and says: \u201cIn\nthree-quarters of an hour she was dead.\u201d_) I must have imagined that\nhis own constitution was not much stronger, and that I should soon be\ntravelling, in spite of my health, in answer to far worse news\u2014and\nthat I should arrive too _late_, for which I should reproach myself\nfor ever.[FF] This reproach about arriving too late has become the\ncentral point of the dream, but has been represented in a scene in\nwhich the honoured teacher of my student years\u2014Bruecke\u2014reproaches me\nfor the same thing with a terrible look from his blue eyes. The cause\nof this deviation from the scene will soon be clear; the dream cannot\nreproduce the scene itself in the manner in which it occurred to me.\nTo be sure, it leaves the blue eyes to the other man, but it gives me\nthe part of the annihilator, an inversion which is obviously the\nresult of the wish-fulfilment. My concern for the life of my friend,\nmy self-reproach for not having gone to him, my shame (he had\nrepeatedly come to me in Vienna), my desire to consider myself excused\non account of my illness\u2014all of this makes up a tempest of feeling\nwhich is distinctly felt in sleep, and which raged in every part of\nthe dream thoughts.\nBut there was another thing about the occasion for the dream which had\nquite the opposite effect. With the unfavourable news during the first\ndays of the operation, I also received the injunction to speak to no one\nabout the whole affair, which hurt my feelings, for it betrayed an\nunnecessary distrust of my discretion. I knew, of course, that this\nrequest did not proceed from my friend, but that it was due to\nclumsiness or excessive timidity on the part of the messenger, but the\nconcealed reproach made me feel very badly because it was not altogether\nunjustified. Only reproaches which \u201chave something in them\u201d have power\nto irritate, as everyone knows. For long before, in the case of two\npersons who were friendly to each other and who were willing to honour\nme with their friendship, I had quite needlessly tattled what the one\nhad said about the other; to be sure this incident had nothing to do\nwith the affairs of my friend F. Nor have I forgotten the reproaches\nwhich I had to listen to at that time. One of the two friends between\nwhom I was the trouble-maker was Professor Fleischl; the other one I may\nname Joseph, a name which was also borne by my friend and antagonist P.,\nwho appears in the dream.\nTwo dream elements, first _inconspicuously_, and secondly the question\nof _Fl. as to how much of his affairs I have mentioned to P._, give\nevidence of the reproach that I am incapable of keeping anything to\nmyself. But it is the admixture of these recollections which transposes\nthe reproach for arriving too late from the present to the time when I\nwas living in Bruecke\u2019s laboratory; and by replacing the second person\nin the annihilation scene of the dream by a Joseph I succeed in\nrepresenting not only the first reproach that I arrive too late, but\nalso a second reproach, which is more rigorously suppressed, that I keep\nno secrets. The condensing and replacing activity of this dream, as well\nas the motives for it, are now obvious.\nMy anger at the injunction not to give anything away, originally quite\ninsignificant, receives confirmation from sources that flow far below\nthe surface, and so become a swollen stream of hostile feelings towards\npersons who are in reality dear to me. The source which furnishes the\nconfirmation is to be found in childhood. I have already said that my\nfriendships as well as my enmities with persons of my own age go back to\nmy childish relations with my nephew, who was a year older than I. In\nthese he had the upper hand, and I early learned how to defend myself;\nwe lived together inseparably, loved each other, and at the same time,\nas statements of older persons testify, scuffled with and accused each\nother. In a certain sense all my friends are incarnations of this first\nfigure, \u201cwhich early appeared to my blurred sight\u201d; they are all\n_revenants_. My nephew himself returned in the years of adolescence, and\nthen we acted C\u00e6sar and Brutus. An intimate friend and a hated enemy\nhave always been indispensable requirements for my emotional life; I\nhave always been able to create them anew, and not infrequently my\nchildish ideal has been so closely approached that friend and enemy\ncoincided in the same person, not simultaneously, of course, nor in\nrepeated alterations, as had been the case in my first childhood years.\nI do not here wish to trace the manner in which a recent occasion for\nemotion may reach back to one in childhood\u2014through connections like\nthese I have just described\u2014in order to find a substitute for itself, in\nthis earlier occasion for the sake of increased emotional effect. Such\nan investigation would belong to the psychology of the unconscious, and\nwould find its place in a psychological explanation of neuroses. Let us\nassume for the purposes of dream interpretation that a childhood\nrecollection makes its appearance or is formed by the fancy, say to the\nfollowing effect: Two children get into a fight on account of some\nobject\u2014just what we shall leave undecided, although memory or an\nallusion of memory has a very definite one in mind\u2014and each one claims\nthat he got to it first, and that he, therefore, has first right to it.\nThey come to blows, for might makes right; and, according to the\nintimation of the dream, I must have known that I was in the wrong\n(_noticing the error myself_), but this time I remain the stronger and\ntake possession of the battlefield; the defeated combatant hurries to my\nfather, his grandfather, and accuses me, and I defend myself with the\nwords which I know from my father: \u201c_I hit him because he hit me._\u201d Thus\nthis recollection, or more probably fancy, which forces itself upon my\nattention in the course of the analysis\u2014from my present knowledge I\nmyself do not know how\u2014becomes an intermediary of the dream thoughts\nthat collects the emotional excitements obtaining in the dream thoughts,\nas the bowl of a fountain collects the streams of water flowing into it.\nFrom this point the dream thoughts flow along the following paths: \u201cIt\nserves you quite right if you had to vacate your place for me; why did\nyou try to force me out of my place? I don\u2019t need you; I\u2019ll soon find\nsomeone else to play with,\u201d &c. Then the ways are opened through which\nthese thoughts again follow into the representation of the dream. For\nsuch an \u201c\u00f4te-toi que je m\u2019y mette\u201d I once had to reproach my deceased\nfriend Joseph. He had been next to me in the line of promotion in\nBruecke\u2019s laboratory, but advancement there was very slow. Neither of\nthe two assistants budged from his place, and youth became impatient. My\nfriend, who knew that his time of life was limited, and who was bound by\nno tie to his superior, was a man seriously ill; the wish for his\nremoval permitted an objectionable interpretation\u2014he might be moved by\nsomething besides promotion. Several years before, the same wish for\nfreedom had naturally been more intense in my own case; wherever in the\nworld there are gradations of rank and advancement, the doors are opened\nfor wishes needing suppression. Shakespeare\u2019s Prince Hal cannot get rid\nof the temptation to see how the crown fits even at the bed of his sick\nfather. But, as may easily be understood, the dream punishes this\nruthless wish not upon me but upon him.[FG]\n\u201cAs he was ambitious, I slew him.\u201d As he could not wait for the other\nman to make way for him, he himself has been put out of the way. I\nharbour these thoughts immediately after attending the unveiling of the\nstatue to the other man at the university. A part of the satisfaction\nwhich I feel in the dream may therefore be interpreted: Just punishment;\nit served you right.\nAt the funeral of this friend a young man made the following remark,\nwhich seemed out of place: \u201cThe preacher talked as though the world\ncouldn\u2019t exist without this one human being.\u201d The displeasure of the\nsincere man, whose sorrow has been marred by the exaggeration, begins to\narise in him. But with this speech are connected the dream thoughts: \u201cNo\none is really irreplaceable; how many men have I already escorted to the\ngrave, but I am still living, I have survived them all, I claim the\nfield.\u201d Such a thought at the moment when I fear that when I travel to\nsee him I shall find my friend no longer among the living, permits only\nof the further development that I am glad I am surviving someone, that\nit is not I who have died, but he\u2014that I occupy the field as I once did\nin the fancied scene in childhood. This satisfaction, coming from\nsources in childhood, at the fact that I claim the field, covers the\nlarger part of the emotion which appears in the dream. I am glad that I\nam the survivor\u2014I express this sentiment with the na\u00efve egotism of the\nhusband who says to his wife: \u201cIf one of us dies, I shall move to\nParis.\u201d It is such a matter of course for my expectation that I am not\nto be the one.\nIt cannot be denied that great self-control is necessary to interpret\none\u2019s dreams and to report them. It is necessary for you to reveal\nyourself as the one scoundrel among all the noble souls with whom you\nshare the breath of life. Thus, I consider it quite natural that\n_revenants_ exist only as long as they are wanted, and that they can be\nobviated by a wish. This is the thing for which my friend Joseph has\nbeen punished. But the _revenants_ are the successive incarnations of\nthe friend of my childhood; I am also satisfied at the fact that I have\nreplaced this person for myself again and again, and a substitute will\ndoubtless soon be found even for the friend whom I am about to lose. No\none is irreplaceable.\nBut what has the dream censor been doing meanwhile? Why does it not\nraise the most emphatic objection to a train of thought characterised by\nsuch brutal selfishness, and change the satisfaction that adheres to it\ninto profound repugnance? I think it is because other unobjectionable\ntrains of thought likewise result in satisfaction and cover the emotion\ncoming from forbidden infantile sources with their own. In another\nstratum of thought I said to myself at that festive unveiling: \u201cI have\nlost so many dear friends, some through death, some through the\ndissolution of friendship\u2014is it not beautiful that I have found\nsubstitutes for them, that I have gained one who means more to me than\nthe others could, whom I shall from now on always retain, at the age\nwhen it is not easy to form new friendships?\u201d The satisfaction that I\nhave found this substitute for lost friends can be taken over into the\ndream without interference, but behind it there sneaks in the inimical\nsatisfaction from the infantile source. Childish affection undoubtedly\nassists in strengthening the justifiable affection of to-day; but\nchildish hatred has also found its way into the representation.\nBut besides this there is distinct reference in the dream to another\nchain of thoughts, which may manifest itself in the form of\nsatisfaction. My friend had shortly before had a little daughter born,\nafter long waiting. I knew how much he had grieved for the sister whom\nhe lost at an early age, and I wrote to him that he would transfer to\nthis child the love he had felt for her. This little girl would at last\nmake him forget his irreparable loss.\nThus this chain also connects with the intermediary thoughts of the\nlatent dream content, from which the ways spread out in opposite\ndirections: No one is irreplaceable. You see, nothing but _revenants_;\nall that one has lost comes back. And now the bonds of association\nbetween the contradictory elements of the dream thoughts are more\ntightly drawn by the accidental circumstance that the little daughter of\nmy friend bears the same name as the girl playmate of my own youth, who\nwas just my own age and the sister of my oldest friend and antagonist. I\nhave heard the name \u201cPauline\u201d with _satisfaction_, and in order to\nallude to this coincidence I have replaced one Joseph in the dream by\nanother Joseph, and have not overlooked the similarity in sound between\nthe names Fleischl and F. From this point a train of thought runs to the\nnaming of my own children. I insisted that the names should not be\nchosen according to the fashion of the day but should be determined by\nregard for the memory of beloved persons. The children\u2019s names make them\n\u201c_revenants_.\u201d And, finally, is not the having of children the only\naccess to immortality for us all?\nI shall add only a few remarks about the emotions of the dream from\nanother point of view. An emotional inclination\u2014what we call a mood\u2014may\noccur in the mind of a sleeping person as its dominating element, and\nmay induce a corresponding mood in the dream. This mood may be the\nresult of the experiences and thoughts of the day, or it may be of\nsomatic origin; in either case it will be accompanied by the chains of\nthought that correspond to it. The fact that in the one case this\npresentation content conditions the emotional inclination primarily, and\nthat in the other case it is brought about secondarily by a disposition\nof feeling of somatic origin remains without influence upon the\nformation of the dream. This formation is always subject to the\nrestriction that it can represent only a wish-fulfilment, and that it\nmay put its psychic motive force at the service only of the wish. The\nmood that is actually present will receive the same treatment as the\nsensation which actually comes to the surface during sleep (_cf._ p.\n198), which is either neglected or reinterpreted so as to signify a\nwish-fulfilment. Disagreeable moods during sleep become a motive force\nof the dream by actuating energetic wishes, which the dream must fulfil.\nThe material to which they are attached is worked over until it finally\nbecomes suitable for the expression of the fulfilled wish. The more\nintense and the more dominating the element of the disagreeable mood in\nthe dream thought, the more surely will the wish-impulses that have been\nmost rigorously suppressed take advantage of the opportunity to secure\nrepresentation, for they find that the difficult part of the work\nnecessary in securing representation has already been accomplished in\nthat the repugnance is already actually in existence, which they would\notherwise have had to produce by their own effort. With this discussion\nwe again touch upon the problem of anxiety dreams, which we may regard\nas bounding the province of the dream activity.\n(_h_) _Secondary Elaboration._\nWe may at last proceed to an exposition of the fourth of the factors\nwhich take part in the formation of the dream.\nIf we continue the examination of the dream content, in the manner\nalready outlined\u2014that is, by testing striking occurrences as to their\norigin in the dream thoughts\u2014we encounter elements which can be\nexplained only by making an entirely new assumption. I have in mind\ncases where one shows astonishment, anger, or resistance in a dream, and\nthat, too, against a party of the dream content itself. Most of these\nexercises of the critical faculty in dreams are not directed against the\ndream content, but prove to be portions of dream material which have\nbeen taken over and suitably made use of, as I have shown by fitting\nexamples. Some things of this sort, however, cannot be disposed of in\nsuch a way; their correlative cannot be found in the dream material.\nWhat, for instance, is meant by the criticism not infrequent in dreams:\n\u201cWell, it\u2019s only a dream\u201d? This is a genuine criticism of the dream such\nas I might make if I were awake. Not at all infrequently it is the\nforerunner to waking; still oftener it is preceded by a painful feeling,\nwhich subsides when the certainty of the dream state has been\nestablished. The thought: \u201cBut it\u2019s only a dream,\u201d occurring during the\ndream, has the same object which is meant to be conveyed on the stage\nthrough the mouth of the beautiful Helen von Offenbach; it wants to\nminimise what has just occurred and secure indulgence for what is to\nfollow. Its purpose is to reassure and, so to speak, put to sleep a\ncertain instance which at the given moment has every reason to be active\nand to forbid the continuation of the dream\u2014or the scene. It is\npleasanter to go on sleeping and to tolerate the dream, \u201cbecause it\u2019s\nonly a dream anyway.\u201d I imagine that the disparaging criticism, \u201cBut\nit\u2019s only a dream,\u201d enters into the dream at the moment when the censor,\nwhich has never been quite asleep, feels that it has been surprised by\nthe already admitted dream. It is too late to suppress the dream, and\nthe instance therefore carries with it that note of fear or of painful\nfeeling which presents itself in the dream. It is an expression of the\n_esprit d\u2019escalier_ on the part of the psychic censor.\nIn this example we have faultless proof that not everything which the\ndream contains comes from the dream thoughts, but that a psychic\nfunction which cannot be differentiated from our waking thoughts may\nmake contributions to the dream content. The question now is, does this\noccur only in altogether exceptional cases, or does the psychic instance\nwhich is usually active only as censor take a regular part in the\nformation of dreams?\nOne must decide unhesitatingly for the latter view. It is indisputable\nthat the censoring instance, whose influence we have so far recognised\nonly in limitations and omissions in the dream content, is also\nresponsible for interpolations and amplifications in this content. Often\nthese interpolations are easily recognised; they are reported\nirresolutely, prefaced by an \u201cas if,\u201d they are not in themselves\nparticularly vivid, and are regularly inserted at points where they may\nserve to connect two portions of the dream content or improve the\nsequence between two sections of the dream. They manifest less ability\nto stick in the memory than genuine products of the dream material; if\nthe dream is subject to forgetting, they are the first to fall away, and\nI am strongly inclined to believe that our frequent complaint that we\nhave dreamed so much, that we have forgotten most of this and have\nremembered only fragments of it, rests on the immediate falling away of\njust these cementing thoughts. In a complete analysis these\ninterpolations are often betrayed by the fact that no material is to be\nfound for them in the dream thoughts. But after careful examination I\nmust designate this case as a rare one; usually interpolated thoughts\ncan be traced to an element in the dream thoughts, which, however, can\nclaim a place in the dream neither on account of its own merit nor on\naccount of over-determination. The psychic function in dream formation,\nwhich we are now considering, aspires to the original creations only in\nthe most extreme cases; whenever possible, it makes use of anything\navailable it can find in the dream material.\nThe thing which distinguishes and reveals this part of the dream\nactivity is its tendency. This function proceeds in a manner similar to\nthat which the poet spitefully attributes to the philosopher; with its\nscraps and rags, it stops up the breaches in the structure of the dream.\nThe result of its effort is that the dream loses the appearance of\nabsurdity and incoherence, and approaches the pattern of an intelligible\nexperience. But the effort is not always crowned with complete success.\nThus dreams occur which may seem faultlessly logical and correct upon\nsuperficial examination; they start from a possible situation, continue\nit by means of consistent changes, and end up\u2014although this is very\nrare\u2014with a not unnatural conclusion. These dreams have been subjected\nto the most thorough elaboration at the hands of a psychic function\nsimilar to our waking thought; they seem to have a meaning, but this\nmeaning is very far removed from the real signification of the dream. If\nthey are analysed, one is convinced that the secondary elaboration has\ndistorted the material very freely, and has preserved its proper\nrelations as little as possible. These are the dreams which have, so to\nspeak, already been interpreted before we subject them to waking\ninterpretation. In other dreams this purposeful elaboration has been\nsuccessful only to a certain point; up to this point consistency seems\nto be dominant, then the dream becomes nonsensical or confused, and\nperhaps finally it lifts itself for a second time in its course to an\nappearance of rationality. In still other dreams the elaboration has\nfailed completely; we find ourselves helpless in the presence of a\nsenseless mass of fragmentary contents.\nI do not wish to deny to this fourth dream-moulding power, which will\nsoon seem to us a familiar one\u2014it is in reality the only one among the\nfour dream-moulders with which we are familiar,\u2014I do not wish to deny\nthis fourth factor the capability of creatively furnishing the dream\nwith new contributions. But surely its influence, like that of the\nothers, manifests itself preponderatingly in the preferring and choosing\nof already created psychic material in the dream thoughts. Now there is\na case where it is spared the work, for the most part, of building, as\nit were, a fa\u00e7ade to the dream, by the fact that such a structure,\nwaiting to be used, is already to be found complete in the material of\nthe dream thoughts. The element of the dream thoughts which I have in\nmind, I am in the habit of designating as a \u201cphantasy\u201d; perhaps I shall\navoid misunderstanding if I immediately adduce the day dream of waking\nlife as an analogy.[FH] The part played by this element in our psychic\nlife has not yet been fully recognised and investigated by the\npsychiatrists; in this study M. Benedikt has, it seems to me, made a\nhighly promising beginning. The significance of the day dream has not\nyet escaped the unerring insight of poets; the description of the day\ndreams of one of his subordinate characters which A. Daudet gives us in\n_Nabab_ is universally known. A study of the psychoneuroses discloses\nthe astonishing fact that these phantasies or day dreams are the\nimmediate predecessors of hysterical symptoms\u2014at least of a great many\nof them; hysterical symptoms directly depend not upon the memories\nthemselves, but upon phantasies built on the basis of memories. The\nfrequent occurrence of conscious day phantasies brings these formations\nwithin the scope of our knowledge; but just as there are such conscious\nphantasies, so there are a great many unconscious ones, which must\nremain unconscious on account of their content and on account of their\norigin from repressed material. A more thorough examination into the\ncharacter of these day phantasies shows with what good reason the same\nname has been given to these formations as to the products of our\nnocturnal thought,\u2014dreams. They possess an essential part of their\nproperties in common with nocturnal dreams; an examination of them would\nreally have afforded the shortest and best approach to an understanding\nof night dreams.\nLike dreams, they are fulfilments of wishes; like dreams a good part of\nthem are based upon the impressions of childish experiences; like dreams\ntheir creations enjoy a certain amount of indulgence from the censor. If\nwe trace their formation, we see how the wish motive, which is active in\ntheir production, has taken the material of which they are built, mixed\nit together, rearranged it, and composed it into a new unit. They bear\nthe same relation to the childish memories, to which they go back, as\nsome of the quaint palaces of Rome bear to the ancient ruins, whose\nfreestones and pillars have furnished the material for the structure\nbuilt in modern form.\nIn the \u201csecondary elaboration\u201d of the dream content which we have\nascribed to our fourth dream-making factor, we again find the same\nactivity which in the creation of day dreams is allowed to manifest\nitself unhampered by other influences. We may say without further\npreliminary that this fourth factor of ours seeks to form something\n_like a day dream_ from the material at hand. Where, however, such a day\ndream has already been formed in connection with the dream thought, this\nfactor of the dream-work will preferably get control of it, and strive\nto introduce it into the dream content. There are dreams which consist\nmerely of the repetition of such a day fancy, a fancy which has perhaps\nremained unconscious\u2014as, for instance, the dream of the boy that he is\nriding with the heroes of the Trojan war in a war chariot. In my dream\n\u201cAutodidasker,\u201d at least the second part of the dream is the faithful\nrepetition of a day phantasy\u2014harmless in itself\u2014about my dealings with\nProfessor N. The fact that the phantasy thus provided more often forms\nonly one part of the dream, or that only one part of the phantasy that\nmakes its way to the dream content, has its origin in the complexity of\nthe conditions which the dream must satisfy at its genesis. On the\nwhole, the phantasy is treated like any other component of the latent\nmaterial; still it is often recognisable in the dream as a whole. In my\ndreams parts often occur which are emphasized by an impression different\nfrom that of the rest. They seem to me to be in a state of flux, to be\nmore coherent and at the same time more transient than other pieces of\nthe same dream. I know that these are unconscious phantasies which get\ninto the dream by virtue of their association, but I have never\nsucceeded in registering such a phantasy. For the rest these phantasies,\nlike all other component parts of the dream thoughts, are jumbled\ntogether and condensed, one covered up by another, and the like; but\nthere are all degrees, from the case where they may constitute the dream\ncontent or at least the dream fa\u00e7ade unchanged to the opposite case,\nwhere they are represented in the dream content by only one of their\nelements or by a remote allusion to such an element. The extent to which\nthe phantasies are able to withstand the demands of the censor and the\ntendency to condensation are, of course, also decisive of their fate\namong the dream thoughts.\nIn my choice of examples for dream analysis I have, wherever possible,\navoided those dreams in which unconscious fancies play a somewhat\nimportant part, because the introduction of this psychic element would\nhave necessitated extensive discussion of the psychology of unconscious\nthought. But I cannot entirely omit the \u201cphantasy\u201d even in this matter\nof examples, because it often gets fully into the dream and still more\noften distinctly pervades it. I may mention one more dream, which seems\nto be composed of two distinct and opposed phantasies, overlapping each\nother at certain places, of which the first is superficial, while the\nsecond becomes, as it were, the interpreter of the first.[FI]\nThe dream\u2014it is the only one for which I have no careful notes\u2014is about\nto this effect: The dreamer\u2014an unmarried young man\u2014is sitting in an inn,\nwhich is seen correctly; several persons come to get him, among them\nsomeone who wants to arrest him. He says to his table companions, \u201cI\nwill pay later, I am coming back.\u201d But they call to him, laughing\nscornfully: \u201cWe know all about that; that\u2019s what everybody says.\u201d One\nguest calls after him: \u201cThere goes another one.\u201d He is then led to a\nnarrow hall, where he finds a woman with a child in her arms. One of his\nescorts says: \u201cThat is Mr. M\u00fcller.\u201d A commissioner or some other\nofficial is running through a bundle of tickets or papers repeating\nM\u00fcller, M\u00fcller, M\u00fcller. At last the commissioner asks him a question,\nwhich he answers with \u201cYes.\u201d He then takes a look at the woman, and\nnotices that she has grown a large beard.\nThe two component parts are here easily separated. What is superficial\nis the _phantasy of being arrested_; it seems to be newly created by the\ndream-work. But behind it appears the _phantasy of marriage_, and this\nmaterial, on the contrary, has undergone but slight change at the hands\nof the dream activity. The features which are common to both phantasies\ncome into distinct prominence as in a Galton\u2019s composite photograph. The\npromise of the bachelor to come back to his place at the club table, the\nscepticism of the drinking companions, sophisticated in their many\nexperiences, the calling after: \u201cThere goes (marries) another one,\u201d\u2014all\nthese features can easily be capable of the other interpretation.\nLikewise the affirmative answer given to the official. Running through\nthe bundle of papers with the repetition of the name, corresponds to a\nsubordinate but well-recognised feature of the marriage ceremonies\u2014the\nreading aloud of the congratulatory telegrams which have arrived\nirregularly, and which, of course, are all addressed to the same name.\nIn the matter of the bride\u2019s personal appearance in this dream, the\nmarriage phantasy has even got the better of the arrest phantasy which\nconceals it. The fact that this bride finally displays a beard, I can\nexplain from an inquiry\u2014I had no chance to make an analysis. The dreamer\nhad on the previous day crossed the street with a friend who was just as\nhostile to marriage as himself, and had called his friend\u2019s attention to\na beautiful brunette who was coming towards them. The friend had\nremarked: \u201cYes, if only these women wouldn\u2019t get beards, as they grow\nolder, like their fathers.\u201d\nOf course there is no lack of elements in this dream, on which the dream\ndisfigurement has done more thorough work. Thus the speech: \u201cI will pay\nlater,\u201d may have reference to the conduct of the father-in-law in the\nmatter of dowry\u2014which is uncertain. Obviously all kinds of scruples are\npreventing the dreamer from surrendering himself with pleasure to the\nphantasy of marrying. One of these apprehensions\u2014lest one\u2019s freedom be\nlost when one marries\u2014has embodied itself in the transformation to a\nscene of arrest.\nLet us return to the thesis that the dream activity likes to make use of\na phantasy which is finished and at hand, instead of creating one afresh\nfrom the material of the dream thoughts; we shall perhaps solve one of\nthe most interesting riddles of the dream if we keep this fact in mind.\nI have on page 21 related the dream of Maury,[48] who is struck on the\nback of the neck with a stick, and who awakes in the possession of a\nlong dream\u2014a complete romance from the time of the French Revolution.\nSince the dream is represented as coherent and as explicable by\nreference to the disturbing stimulus alone, about the occurrence of\nwhich stimulus the sleeper could suspect nothing, only one assumption\nseems to be left, namely, that the whole richly elaborated dream must\nhave been composed and must have taken place in the short space of time\nbetween the falling of the stick on Maury\u2019s cervical vertebra and the\nawakening induced by the blow. We should not feel justified in ascribing\nsuch rapidity to the waking mental activity, and so are inclined to\ncredit the dream activity with a remarkable acceleration of thought as\none of its characteristics.\nAgainst this inference, which rapidly becomes popular, more recent\nauthors (Le Lorrain,[45] Egger,[20] and others) have made emphatic\nobjection. They partly doubt the correctness with which the dream was\nreported by Maury, and partly try to show that the rapidity of our\nwaking mental capacity is quite as great as that which we may concede\nwithout reservation to the dream activity. The discussion raises\nfundamental questions, the settlement of which I do not think concerns\nme closely. But I must admit that the argument, for instance, of Egger\nhas not impressed me as convincing against the guillotine dream of\nMaury. I would suggest the following explanation of this dream: Would it\nbe very improbable that the dream of Maury exhibits a phantasy which had\nbeen preserved in his memory in a finished state for years, and which\nwas awakened\u2014I should rather say alluded to\u2014at the moment when he became\naware of the disturbing stimulus? The difficulty of composing such a\nlong story with all its details in the exceedingly short space of time\nwhich is here at the disposal of the dreamer then disappears; the story\nis already composed. If the stick had struck Maury\u2019s neck when he was\nawake there would perhaps have been time for the thought: \u201cWhy, that\u2019s\nlike being guillotined.\u201d But as he is struck by the stick while asleep,\nthe dream activity quickly finds occasion in the incoming stimulus to\nconstruct a wish-fulfilment, as though it thought (this is to be taken\nentirely figuratively): \u201cHere is a good opportunity to realise the wish\nphantasy which I formed at such and such a time while I was reading.\u201d\nThat this dream romance is just such a one as a youth would be likely to\nfashion under the influence of powerful impressions does not seem\nquestionable to me. Who would not have been carried away\u2014especially a\nFrenchman and a student of the history of civilisation\u2014by descriptions\nof the Reign of Terror, in which the aristocracy, men and women, the\nflower of the nation, showed that it was possible to die with a light\nheart, and preserved their quick wit and refinement of life until the\nfatal summons? How tempting to fancy one\u2019s self in the midst of all this\nas one of the young men who parts from his lady with a kiss of the hand\nto climb fearlessly upon the scaffold! Or perhaps ambition is the ruling\nmotive of the phantasy\u2014the ambition to put one\u2019s self in the place of\none of those powerful individuals who merely, by the force of their\nthinking and their fiery eloquence, rule the city in which the heart of\nmankind is beating so convulsively, who are impelled by conviction to\nsend thousands of human beings to their death, and who pave the way for\nthe transformation of Europe; who, meanwhile, are not sure of their own\nheads, and may one day lay them under the knife of the guillotine,\nperhaps in the r\u00f4le of one of the Girondists or of the hero Danton? The\nfeature, \u201caccompanied by an innumerable multitude,\u201d which is preserved\nin the memory, seems to show that Maury\u2019s phantasy is an ambitious one\nof this sort.\nBut this phantasy, which has for a long time been ready, need not be\nexperienced again in sleep; it suffices if it is, so to speak, \u201ctouched\noff.\u201d What I mean is this: If a few notes are struck and someone says,\nas in _Don Juan_: \u201cThat is from _Figaro\u2019s Wedding_ by Mozart,\u201d memories\nsuddenly surge up within me, none of which I can in the next moment\nrecall to consciousness. The characteristic phrase serves as an entrance\nstation from which a complete whole is simultaneously put in motion. It\nneed not be different in the case of unconscious thought. The psychic\nstation which opens the way to the whole guillotine phantasy is set in\nmotion by the waking stimulus. This phantasy, however, is not passed in\nreview during sleep, but only afterwards in waking memory. Upon\nawakening one remembers the details of the phantasy, which in the dream\nwas regarded as a whole. There is, withal, no means of making sure that\none really has remembered anything which has been dreamed. The same\nexplanation, namely, that one is dealing with finished phantasies which\nhave been set in motion as wholes by the waking stimulus, may be applied\nto still other dreams which proceed from a waking stimulus\u2014for instance\nto the battle dream of Napoleon at the explosion of the bomb. I do not\nmean to assert that all waking dreams admit of this explanation, or that\nthe problem of the accelerated discharge of ideas in dreams is to be\naltogether solved in this manner.\nWe must not neglect the relation of this secondary elaboration of the\ndream content to the other factors in the dream activity. Might the\nprocedure be as follows: the dream-creating factors, the impulse to\ncondense, the necessity of evading the censor, and the regard for\ndramatic fitness in the psychic resources of the dream\u2014these first of\nall create a provisional dream content, and this is then subsequently\nmodified until it satisfies the exactions of a second instance? This is\nhardly probable. It is necessary rather to assume that the demands of\nthis instance are from the very beginning lodged in one of the\nconditions which the dream must satisfy, and that this condition, just\nlike those of condensation, of censorship, and of dramatic fitness,\nsimultaneously affect the whole mass of material in the dream thoughts\nin an inductive and selective manner. But of the four conditions\nnecessary for the dream formation, the one last recognised is the one\nwhose exactions appear to be least binding upon the dream. That this\npsychic function, which undertakes the so-called secondary elaboration\nof the dream content is identical with the work of our waking thought\nmay be inferred with great probability from the following\nconsideration:\u2014Our waking (foreconscious) thought behaves towards a\ngiven object of perception just exactly as the function in question\nbehaves towards the dream content. It is natural for our waking thought\nto bring about order in the material of perception, to construct\nrelationships, and to make it subject to the requirements of an\nintelligible coherence. Indeed, we go too far in doing this; the tricks\nof prestidigitators deceive us by taking advantage of this intellectual\nhabit. In our effort to put together the sensory impressions which are\noffered to us in a comprehensible manner, we often commit the most\nbizarre errors and even distort the truth of the material we have before\nus. Proofs for this are too generally familiar to need more extended\nconsideration here. We fail to see errors in a printed page because our\nimagination pictures the proper words. The editor of a widely-read\nFrench paper is said to have risked the wager that he could print the\nwords \u201cfrom in front\u201d or \u201cfrom behind\u201d in every sentence of a long\narticle without any of his readers noticing it. He won the wager. A\ncurious example of incorrect associations years ago caught my attention\nin a newspaper. After the session of the French chamber, at which Dupuy\nquelled a panic caused by the explosion of a bomb thrown into the hall\nby an anarchist by saying calmly, \u201cLa s\u00e9ance continue,\u201d the visitors in\nthe gallery were asked to testify as to their impression of the\nattempted assassination. Among them were two provincials. One of these\ntold that immediately after the conclusion of a speech he had heard a\ndetonation, but had thought that it was the custom in parliament to fire\na shot whenever a speaker had finished. The other, who had apparently\nalready heard several speakers, had got the same idea, with the\nvariation, however, that he supposed this shooting to be a sign of\nappreciation following an especially successful speech.\nThus the psychic instance which approaches the dream content with the\ndemand that it must be intelligible, which subjects it to preliminary\ninterpretation, and in doing so brings about a complete misunderstanding\nof it, is no other than our normal thought. In our interpretation the\nrule will be in every case to disregard the apparent coherence of the\ndream as being of suspicious origin, and, whether the elements are clear\nor confused, to follow the same regressive path to the dream material.\nWe now learn upon what the scale of quality in dreams from confusion to\nclearness\u2014mentioned above, page 305\u2014essentially depends. Those parts of\nthe dream with which the secondary elaboration has been able to\naccomplish something seem to us clear; those where the power of this\nactivity has failed seem confused. Since the confused parts of the dream\nare often also those which are less vividly imprinted, we may conclude\nthat the secondary dream-work is also responsible for a contribution to\nthe plastic intensity of the individual dream structures.\nIf I were to seek an object of comparison for the definitive formation\nof the dream as it manifests itself under the influence of normal\nthinking, none better offers itself than those mysterious inscriptions\nwith which _Die Fliegende Blaetter_ has so long amused its readers. The\nreader is supposed to find a Latin inscription concealed in a given\nsentence which, for the sake of contrast, is in dialect and as\nscurrilous as possible in significance. For this purpose the letters are\ntaken from their groupings in syllables and are newly arranged. Now and\nthen a genuine Latin word results, at other places we think that we have\nabbreviations of such words before us, and at still other places in the\ninscription we allow ourselves to be carried along over the\nsenselessness of the disjointed letters by the semblance of\ndisintegrated portions or by breaks in the inscription. If we do not\nwish to respond to the jest we must give up looking for an inscription,\nmust take the letters as we see them, and must compose them into words\nof our mother tongue, unmindful of the arrangement which is offered.\nI shall now undertake a r\u00e9sum\u00e9 of this extended discussion of the dream\nactivity. We were confronted by the question whether the mind exerts all\nits capabilities to the fullest development in dream formation, or only\na fragment of its capabilities, and these restricted in their activity.\nOur investigation leads us to reject such a formulation of the question\nentirely as inadequate to our circumstances. But if we are to remain on\nthe same ground when we answer as that on which the question is urged\nupon us, we must acquiesce in two conceptions which are apparently\nopposed and mutually exclusive. The psychic activity in dream formation\nresolves itself into two functions\u2014the provision of the dream thoughts\nand the transformation of these into the dream content. The dream\nthoughts are entirely correct, and are formed with all the psychic\nexpenditure of which we are capable; they belong to our thoughts which\nhave not become conscious, from which our thoughts which have become\nconscious also result by means of a certain transposition. Much as there\nmay be about them which is worth knowing and mysterious, these problems\nhave no particular relation to the dream, and have no claim to be\ntreated in connection with dream problems. On the other hand, there is\nthat second portion of the activity which changes the unconscious\nthoughts into the dream content, an activity peculiar to dream life and\ncharacteristic of it. Now, this peculiar dream-work is much further\nremoved from the model of waking thought than even the most decided\ndepreciators of psychic activity in dream formation have thought. It is\nnot, one might say, more negligent, more incorrect, more easily\nforgotten, more incomplete than waking thought; it is something\nqualitatively altogether different from waking thought, and therefore\nnot in any way comparable to it. It does not in general think,\ncalculate, or judge at all, but limits itself to transforming. It can be\nexhaustively described if the conditions which must be satisfied at its\ncreation are kept in mind. This product, the dream, must at any cost be\nwithdrawn from the censor, and for this purpose the dream activity makes\nuse of the _displacement of psychic intensities_ up to the\ntransvaluation of all psychic values; thoughts must exclusively or\npredominatingly be reproduced in the material of visual and acoustic\ntraces of memory, and this requirement secures for the dream-work the\n_regard for presentability_, which meets the requirement by furnishing\nnew displacements. Greater intensities are (probably) to be provided\nthan are each night at the disposal of the dream thoughts, and this\npurpose is served by the prolific _condensation_ which is undertaken\nwith the component parts of the dream thoughts. Little attention is paid\nto the logical relations of the thought material; they ultimately find a\nveiled representation in the _formal_ peculiarities of the dream. The\naffects of the dream thoughts undergo lesser changes than their\npresentation content. As a rule they are suppressed; where they are\npreserved they are freed from the presentations and put together\naccording to their similarity. Only one part of the dream-work\u2014the\nrevision varying in amount, made by the partially roused conscious\nthought\u2014at all agrees with the conception which the authors have tried\nto extend to the entire activity of dream formation.\nVII\nTHE PSYCHOLOGY OF THE DREAM ACTIVITIES\nAmong the dreams which I have heard from others there is one which at\nthis point is especially worthy of our attention. It was told to me by a\nfemale patient who in turn had heard it in a lecture on dreams. Its\noriginal source is unknown to me. This dream evidently made a deep\nimpression upon the lady, as she went so far as to imitate it, _i.e._ to\nrepeat the elements of this dream in a dream of her own in order to\nexpress by this transference her agreement with it in a certain point.\nThe essential facts of this illustrative dream are as follows: For days\nand nights a father had watched at the sick-bed of his child. After the\nchild died, he retired to rest in an adjoining room, leaving the door\najar, however, so as to enable him to look from his room into the other,\nwhere the corpse lay surrounded by burning candles. An old man, who was\nleft as a watch, sat near the corpse murmuring prayers. After sleeping a\nfew hours the father dreamed that _the child stood near his bed clasping\nhis arms and calling out reproachfully, \u201cFather, don\u2019t you see that I am\nburning?\u201d_ The father woke and noticed a bright light coming from the\nadjoining room. Rushing in, he found the old man asleep, and the covers\nand one arm of the beloved body burned by the fallen candle.\nThe meaning of this affecting dream is simple enough, and the\nexplanation given by the lecturer, as my patient reported it, was\ncorrect. The bright light coming through the open door into the eyes of\nthe sleeper produced the same impression on him as if he had been awake;\nnamely, that a fire had been started near the corpse by a falling\ncandle. It is quite possible that on going to sleep he feared that the\naged guardian was not equal to his task.\nWe can find nothing to change in this interpretation. We can add only\nthat the contents of the dream must be over-determined, and that the\ntalking of the child consisted of phrases that it had uttered while\nstill living, which recalled to the father important events. Perhaps the\ncomplaint, \u201cI am burning,\u201d recalled the fever from which the child died,\nand the words quoted, \u201cFather, don\u2019t you see?\u201d recalled an emotional\noccurrence unknown to us.\nBut after we have recognised the dream as a senseful occurrence which\ncan be correlated with our psychic existence, it may be surprising that\na dream should have taken place under circumstances which necessitated\nsuch immediate awakening. We also notice that the dream does not lack\nthe wish-fulfilment. The child acts as if living; it warns the father\nitself; it comes to his bed and clasps his arms, as it probably did on\nthe occasion which gave origin to the first part of the speech in the\ndream. It was for the sake of this wish-fulfilment that the father slept\na moment longer. The dream triumphed over the conscious reflection\nbecause it could show the child once more alive. If the father had\nawakened first, and had then drawn the conclusion which led him into the\nadjoining room, he would have shortened the child\u2019s life by this one\nmoment.\nThe peculiar feature in this brief dream which engages our interest is\nquite plain. So far we have mainly endeavoured to ascertain wherein the\nsecret meaning of the dream consists, in what way this is to be\ndiscovered, and what means the dream-work uses to conceal it. In other\nwords, our greatest interest has hitherto centred on the problems of\ninterpretation. We now encounter a dream, however, which can be easily\nexplained, the sense of which is plainly presented; and we notice that\nin spite of this fact the dream still preserves the essential features\nwhich plainly differentiate our dreaming from our conscious thinking,\nand thus clearly demands an explanation. After clearing up all the\nproblems of interpretation, we can still feel how imperfect our\npsychology of the dream is.\nBefore entering, however, into this new territory, let us stop and\nreflect whether we have not missed something important on our way\nhither. For it must be frankly admitted that we have been traversing the\neasy and comfortable part of our journey. Hitherto all the paths we have\nfollowed have led, if I mistake not, to light, to explication, and to\nfull understanding, but from the moment that we wish to penetrate deeper\ninto the psychic processes of the dream all paths lead into darkness. It\nis quite impossible to explain the dream as a psychic process, for to\nexplain means to trace to the known, and as yet we do not possess any\npsychological knowledge under which we can range what may be inferred\nfrom our psychological investigation of dreams as their fundamental\nexplanation. On the contrary, we shall be compelled to build a series of\nnew assumptions concerning the structure of the psychic apparatus and\nits active forces; and this we shall have to be careful not to carry\nbeyond the simplest logical concatenation, as its value may otherwise\nmerge into uncertainty. And, even if we should make no mistake in our\nconclusions, and take cognisance of all the logical possibilities\ninvolved, we shall still be threatened with complete failure in our\nsolution through the probable incompleteness of our elemental data. It\nwill also be impossible to gain, or at least to establish, an\nexplanation for the construction and workings of the psychic instrument\neven through a most careful investigation of the dream or any other\n_single_ activity. On the contrary, it will be necessary for this end to\nbring together whatever appears decisively as constant after a\ncomparative study of a whole series of psychic activities. Thus the\npsychological conceptions which we shall gain from an analysis of the\ndream process will have to wait, as it were, at the junction point until\nthey can be connected with the results of other investigations which may\nhave advanced to the nucleus of the same problem from another starting\npoint.\n(_a_) _Forgetting in Dreams._\nI propose, then, first, to turn to a subject which has given rise to an\nobjection hitherto unnoticed, threatening to undermine the foundation of\nour work in dream interpretation. It has been objected in more than one\nquarter that the dream which we wish to interpret is really unknown to\nus, or, to be more precise, that we have no assurance of knowing it as\nit has really occurred (see p. 37). What we recollect of the dream, and\nwhat we subject to our methods of interpretation, is in the first place\ndisfigured through our treacherous memory, which seems particularly\nunfitted to retain the dream, and which may have omitted precisely the\nmost important part of the dream content. For, when we pay attention to\nour dreams, we often find cause to complain that we have dreamed much\nmore than we remember; that, unfortunately, we know nothing more than\nthis one fragment, and that even this seems to us peculiarly uncertain.\nOn the other hand, everything assures us that our memory reproduces the\ndream not only fragmentarily but also delusively and falsely. Just as on\nthe one hand we may doubt whether the material dreamt was really as\ndisconnected and confused as we remember it, so on the other hand may we\ndoubt whether a dream was as connected as we relate it; whether in the\nattempt at reproduction we have not filled in the gaps existing or\ncaused by forgetfulness with new material arbitrarily chosen; whether we\nhave not embellished, rounded off, and prepared the dream so that all\njudgment as to its real content becomes impossible. Indeed, one author\n(Spitta[64]) has expressed his belief that all that is orderly and\nconnected is really first put into the dream during our attempt to\nrecall it. Thus we are in danger of having wrested from our hands the\nvery subject whose value we have undertaken to determine.\nIn our dream interpretations we have thus far ignored these warnings.\nIndeed, the demand for interpretation was, on the contrary, found to be\nno less perceptible in the smallest, most insignificant, and most\nuncertain ingredients of the dream content than in those containing the\ndistinct and definite parts. In the dream of Irma\u2019s injection we read,\n\u201cI quickly called in Dr. M.,\u201d and we assumed that even this small\naddendum would not have gotten into the dream if it had not had a\nspecial derivation. Thus we reached the history of that unfortunate\npatient to whose bed I \u201cquickly\u201d called in the older colleague. In the\napparently absurd dream which treated the difference between 51 and 56\nas _quantit\u00e9 n\u00e9glig\u00e9_, the number 51 was repeatedly mentioned. Instead\nof finding this self-evident or indifferent, we inferred from it a\nsecond train of thought in the latent content of the dream which led to\nthe number 51. By following up this clue we came to the fears which\nplaced 51 years as a limit of life, this being in most marked contrast\nto a dominant train of thought which boastfully knew no limit to life.\nIn the dream \u201cNon Vixit\u201d I found, as an insignificant interposition that\nI at first overlooked, the sentence, \u201cAs P. does not understand him, Fl.\nasks me,\u201d &c. The interpretation then coming to a standstill, I returned\nto these words, and found through them the way to the infantile\nphantasy, which appeared in the dream thoughts as an intermediary point\nof junction. This came about by means of the poet\u2019s verses:\nSeldom have you understood me,\nSeldom have I understood you,\nBut when we got into the mire,\nWe at once understood each other.\nEvery analysis will demonstrate by examples how the most insignificant\nfeatures of the dream are indispensable to the analysis, and how the\nfinishing of the task is delayed by the fact that attention is not at\nfirst directed to them. In the same way we have in the interpretation of\ndreams respected every nuance of verbal expression found in the dream;\nindeed, if we were confronted by a senseless or insufficient wording\nbetraying an unsuccessful effort to translate the dream in the proper\nstyle, we have even respected these defects of expression. In brief,\nwhat the authorities have considered arbitrary improvisation, concocted\nhastily to suit the occasion, we have treated like a sacred text. This\ncontradiction requires an explanation.\nIt is in our favour, without disparagement to the authorities. From the\nviewpoint of our newly-acquired understanding concerning the origin of\nthe dream, the contradictions fall into perfect agreement. It is true\nthat we distort the dream in our attempt to reproduce it; and herein we\nfind another instance of what we have designated as the often\nmisunderstood secondary elaboration of the dream through the influence\nof normal thinking. But this distortion is itself only a part of the\nelaboration to which the dream thoughts are regularly subjected by\nvirtue of the dream censor. The authorities have here divined or\nobserved that part of the dream distortion most obviously at work; to us\nthis is of little importance, for we know that a more prolific work of\ndistortion, not so easily comprehensible, has already chosen the dream\nfrom among the concealed thoughts as its object. The authorities err\nonly in considering the modifications of the dream while it is being\nrecalled and put in words as arbitrary and insoluble; and hence, as\nlikely to mislead us in the interpretation of the dream. We\nover-estimate the determination of the psychic. There is nothing\narbitrary in this field. It can quite generally be shown that a second\ntrain of thought immediately undertakes the determination of the\nelements which have been left undetermined by the first. I wish, _e.g._,\nto think quite voluntarily of a number. This, however, is impossible.\nThe number that occurs to me is definitely and necessarily determined by\nthoughts within me which may be far from my momentary intention.[FJ]\nJust as far from arbitrary are the modifications which the dream\nexperiences through the revision of the waking state. They remain in\nassociative connection with the content, the place of which they take,\nand serve to show us the way to this content, which may itself be the\nsubstitute for another.\nIn the analysis of dreams with patients I am accustomed to institute the\nfollowing proof of this assertion, which has never proved unsuccessful.\nIf the report of a dream appears to me at first difficult to understand,\nI request the dreamer to repeat it. This he rarely does in the same\nwords. The passages wherein the expression is changed have become known\nto me as the weak points of the dream\u2019s disguise, which are of the same\nservice to me as the embroidered mark on Siegfried\u2019s raiment was to\nHagen. The analysis may start from these points. The narrator has been\nadmonished by my announcement that I mean to take special pains to solve\nthe dream, and immediately, under the impulse of resistance, he protects\nthe weak points of the dream\u2019s disguise, replacing the treacherous\nexpressions by remoter ones. He thus calls my attention to the\nexpressions he has dropped. From the efforts made to guard against the\nsolution of the dream, I can also draw conclusions as to the care with\nwhich the dream\u2019s raiment was woven.\nThe authors are, however, less justified in giving so much importance to\nthe doubt which our judgment encounters in relating the dream. It is\ntrue that this doubt betrays the lack of an intellectual assurance, but\nour memory really knows no guarantees, and yet, much more often than is\nobjectively justified, we yield to the pressure of lending credence to\nits statements. The doubt concerning the correct representation of the\ndream, or of its individual data, is again only an offshoot of the dream\ncensor\u2014that is, of the resistance against penetration to consciousness\nof the dream thoughts. This resistance has not entirely exhausted itself\nin bringing about the displacements and substitutions, and it therefore\nadheres as doubt to what has been allowed to pass through. We can\nrecognise this doubt all the easier through the fact that it takes care\nnot to attack the intensive elements of the dream, but only the weak and\nindistinct ones. For we already know that a transvaluation of all the\npsychic values has taken place between the dream thoughts and the dream.\nThe disfigurement has been made possible only by the alteration of\nvalues; it regularly manifests itself in this way and occasionally\ncontents itself with this. If doubt attaches to an indistinct element of\nthe dream content, we may, following the hint, recognise in this element\na direct offshoot of one of the outlawed dream thoughts. It is here just\nas it was after a great revolution in one of the republics of antiquity\nor of the Renaissance. The former noble and powerful ruling families are\nnow banished; all high positions are filled by upstarts; in the city\nitself only the very poor and powerless citizens or the distant\nfollowers of the vanquished party are tolerated. Even they do not enjoy\nthe full rights of citizenship. They are suspiciously watched. Instead\nof the suspicion in the comparison, we have in our case the doubt. I\ntherefore insist that in the analysis of dreams one should emancipate\none\u2019s self from the entire conception of estimating trustworthiness, and\nwhen there is the slightest possibility that this or that occurred in\nthe dream, it should be treated as a full certainty. Until one has\ndecided to reject these considerations in tracing the dream elements,\nthe analysis will remain at a standstill. Antipathy toward the element\nconcerned shows its psychic effect in the person analysed by the fact\nthat the undesirable idea will evoke no thought in his mind. Such effect\nis really not self-evident. It would not be inconsistent if one would\nsay: \u201cWhether this or that was contained in the dream I do not know, but\nthe following thoughts occur to me in this direction.\u201d But he never\nexpresses himself thus; and it is just this disturbing influence of\ndoubt in the analysis that stamps it as an offshoot and instrument of\nthe psychic resistance. Psychoanalysis is justly suspicious. One of its\nrules reads: _Whatever disturbs the continuation of the work is a\nresistance._\nThe forgetting of dreams, too, remains unfathomable as long as we do not\nconsider the force of the psychic censor in its explanation. The\nfeeling, indeed, that one has dreamt a great deal during the night and\nhas retained only a little of it may have another meaning in a number of\ncases. It may perhaps signify that the dream-work has continued\nperceptibly throughout the night, and has left behind only this short\ndream. There is, however, no doubt of the fact that the dream is\nprogressively forgotten on awakening. One often forgets it in spite of\npainful effort to remember. I believe, however, that just as one\ngenerally over-estimates the extent of one\u2019s forgetting, so also one\nover-estimates the deficiencies in one\u2019s knowledge, judging them by the\ngaps occurring in the dream. All that has been lost through forgetting\nin a dream content can often be brought back through analysis. At least,\nin a whole series of cases, it is possible to discover from one single\nremaining fragment, not the dream, to be sure, which is of little\nimportance, but all the thoughts of the dream. It requires a greater\nexpenditure of attention and self-control in the analysis; that is all.\nBut, at the same time, this suggests that the forgetting of the dream\ndoes not lack a hostile intention.\nA convincing proof of the purposeful nature of dream-forgetting, in the\nservice of resistance, is gained in analysis through the investigation\nof a preliminary stage of forgetting.[FK] It often happens that in the\nmidst of interpretation work an omitted fragment of the dream suddenly\ncomes to the surface. This part of the dream snatched from forgetfulness\nis always the most important part. It lies on the shortest road toward\nthe solution of the dream, and for that very reason it was most\nobjectionable to the resistance. Among the examples of dreams that I\nhave collected in connection with this treatise, it once happened that I\nhad to interpose subsequently such a piece of dream content. It was a\ntravelling dream, which took vengeance upon an unlovable female\ntravelling companion; I have left it almost entirely uninterpreted on\naccount of its being in part coarse and nasty. The part omitted read: \u201cI\nsaid about a book by Schiller, \u2018It is from \u2014\u2014\u2019 but corrected myself, for\nI noticed the mistake myself, \u2018It is by.\u2019 Upon this the man remarked to\nhis sister, \u2018Indeed, he said it correctly.\u2019\u201d\nThe self-correction in dreams, which seems so wonderful to some authors,\ndoes not merit consideration by us. I shall rather show from my own\nmemory the model for the grammatical error in the dream. I was nineteen\nyears old when I visited England for the first time, and spent a day on\nthe shore of the Irish Sea. I naturally amused myself by catching the\nsea animals left by the waves, and occupied myself in particular with a\nstarfish (the dream begins with Hollthurn\u2014Holothurian), when a pretty\nlittle girl came over to me and asked me, \u201cIs it a starfish? Is it\nalive?\u201d I answered, \u201cYes, he is alive,\u201d but was then ashamed of my\nmistake and repeated the sentence correctly. For the grammatical mistake\nwhich I then made, the dream substitutes another which is quite common\nwith Germans. \u201cDas Buch ist von Schiller\u201d should not be translated by\n_the book is from_, but _the book is by_. That the dream-work produces\nthis substitution because the word _from_ makes possible, through\nconsonance, a remarkable condensation with the German adjective _fromm_\n(pious, devout), no longer surprises us after all that we have heard\nabout the aims of the dream-work and about its reckless selection of\nmeans of procedure. But what is the meaning of the harmless recollection\nof the seashore in relation to the dream? It explains by means of a very\ninnocent example that I have used the wrong gender\u2014_i.e._ that I have\nput \u201che,\u201d the word denoting the sex or the sexual, where it does not\nbelong. This is surely one of the keys to the solution of dreams. Who\never has heard of the origin of the book-title _Matter and Motion_\n(Moli\u00e8re in _Malade Imaginaire_: La mati\u00e8re est-elle laudable?\u2014A motion\nof the bowels) will readily be able to supply the missing parts.\nMoreover, I can prove conclusively by a _demonstratio ad oculos_ that\nthe forgetting in dreams is in great part due to the activity of\nresistance. A patient tells me that he has dreamed, but that the dream\nhas vanished without leaving a trace, as if nothing had happened. We\ncontinue to work, however; I strike a resistance which I make plain to\nthe patient; by encouraging and urging I help him to become reconciled\nto some disagreeable thought; and as soon as I have succeeded he\nexclaims, \u201cNow, I can recall what I have dreamed.\u201d The same resistance\nwhich that day disturbed him in the work caused him also to forget the\ndream. By overcoming this resistance, I brought the dream to memory.\nIn the same way the patient may, on reaching a certain part of the work,\nrecall a dream which took place three, four, or more days before, and\nwhich has rested in oblivion throughout all this time.\nPsychoanalytic experience has furnished us with another proof of the\nfact that the forgetting of dreams depends more on the resistance than\non the strangeness existing between the waking and sleeping states, as\nthe authorities have believed. It often happens to me, as well as to the\nother analysts and to patients under treatment, that we are awakened\nfrom sleep by a dream, as we would say, and immediately thereafter,\nwhile in full possession of our mental activity, we begin to interpret\nthe dream. In such cases I have often not rested until I gained a full\nunderstanding of the dream, and still it would happen that after the\nawakening I have just as completely forgotten the interpretation work as\nthe dream content itself, though I was aware that I had dreamed and that\nI had interpreted the dream. The dream has more frequently taken along\ninto forgetfulness the result of the interpretation work than it was\npossible for the mental activity to retain the dream in memory. But\nbetween this interpretation work and the waking thoughts there is not\nthat psychic gap through which alone the authorities wish to explain the\nforgetting of dreams. Morton Prince objects to my explanation of the\nforgetting of dreams on the ground that it is only a particular example\nof amnesia for dissociated states, and that the impossibility of\nharmonising my theory with other types of amnesia makes it also\nvalueless for other purposes. He thus makes the reader suspect that in\nall his description of such dissociated states he has never made the\nattempt to find the dynamic explanation for these phenomena. For, had he\ndone so, he surely would have discovered that the repression and the\nresistance produced thereby \u201cis quite as well the cause of this\ndissociation as of the amnesia for its psychic content.\u201d\nThat the dream is as little forgotten as the other psychic acts, and\nthat it clings to memory just as firmly as the other psychic activities\nwas demonstrated to me by an experiment which I was able to make while\ncompiling this manuscript. I have kept in my notes many dreams of my own\nwhich, for some reason at the time I could analyse only imperfectly or\nnot at all. In order to get material to illustrate my assertions, I\nattempted to subject some of them to analysis from one to two years\nlater. I succeeded in this attempt without any exception. Indeed, I may\neven state that the interpretation went more easily at this later time\nthan at the time when the dreams were recent occurrences. As a possible\nexplanation for this fact, I would say that I had gotten over some of\nthe resistances which disturbed me at the time of dreaming. In such\nsubsequent interpretations I have compared the past results in dream\nthoughts with the present, which have usually been more abundant, and\nhave invariably found the past results falling under the present without\nchange. I have, however, soon put an end to my surprise by recalling\nthat I have long been accustomed to interpret dreams from former years\nwhich have occasionally been related to me by patients as if they were\ndreams of the night before, with the same method and the same success. I\nshall report two examples of such delayed dream interpretations in the\ndiscussion of anxiety dreams. When I instituted this experiment for the\nfirst time, I justly expected that the dream would behave in this\nrespect like a neurotic symptom. For when I treat a neurotic, perhaps an\nhysteric, by psychoanalysis, I am compelled to find explanations for the\nfirst symptoms of the disease which have long been forgotten, just as\nfor those still existing which have brought the patient to me; and I\nfind the former problem easier to solve than the more exigent one of\nto-day. In the _Studien \u00fcber Hysterie_, published as early as 1895, I\nwas able to report the explanation of a first hysterical attack of\nanxiety which the patient, a woman over forty years of age, had\nexperienced in her fifteenth year.[FL]\nI may now proceed in an informal way to some further observations on the\ninterpretation of dreams, which will perhaps be of service to the reader\nwho wishes to test my assertion by the analysis of his own dreams.\nNo one must expect that the interpretations of his dreams will come to\nhim overnight without any exertion. Practice is required even for the\nperception of endoptic phenomena and other sensations usually withdrawn\nfrom attention, although this group of perceptions is not opposed by any\npsychic motive. It is considerably more difficult to become master of\nthe \u201cundesirable presentations.\u201d He who wishes to do this will have to\nfulfil the requirements laid down in this treatise. Obeying the rules\nhere given, he will strive during the work to curb in himself every\ncritique, every prejudice, and every affective or intellectual\none-sidedness. We will always be mindful of the precept of Claude\nBernard for the experimenter in the physiological laboratory\u2014\u201cTravailler\ncomme une b\u00eate\u201d\u2014meaning he should be just as persistent, but also just\nas unconcerned about the results. He who will follow these counsels will\nsurely no longer find the task difficult. The interpretation of a dream\ncannot always be accomplished in one session; you often feel, after\nfollowing up a concatenation of thoughts, that your working capacity is\nexhausted; the dream will not tell you anything more on that day; it is\nthen best to break off, and return to the work the following day.\nAnother portion of the dream content then solicits your attention, and\nyou thus find an opening to a new stratum of the dream thoughts. We may\ncall this the \u201cfractionary\u201d interpretation of dreams.\nIt is most difficult to induce the beginner in the interpretation of\ndreams to recognise the fact that his task is not finished though he is\nin possession of a complete interpretation of the dream which is\ningenious and connected, and which explains all the elements of the\ndream. Besides this another superimposed interpretation of the same\ndream may be possible which has escaped him. It is really not simple to\nform an idea of the abundant unconscious streams of thought striving for\nexpression in our minds, and to believe in the skilfulness displayed by\nthe dream-work in hitting, so to speak, with its ambiguous manner of\nexpression, seven flies with one stroke, like the journeyman tailor in\nthe fairy tale. The reader will constantly be inclined to reproach the\nauthor for uselessly squandering his ingenuity, but anyone who has had\nexperience of his own will learn to know better.\nThe question whether every dream can be interpreted may be answered in\nthe negative. One must not forget that in the work of interpretation one\nmust cope with the psychic forces which are responsible for the\ndistortion of the dream. Whether one can become master of the inner\nresistances through his intellectual interest, his capacity for\nself-control, his psychological knowledge, and his practice in dream\ninterpretation becomes a question of the preponderance of forces. It is\nalways possible to make some progress. One can at least go far enough to\nbecome convinced that the dream is an ingenious construction, generally\nfar enough to gain an idea of its meaning. It happens very often that a\nsecond dream confirms and continues the interpretation assumed for the\nfirst. A whole series of dreams running for weeks or months rests on a\ncommon basis, and is therefore to be interpreted in connection. In\ndreams following each other, it may be often observed how one takes as\nits central point what is indicated only as the periphery of the next,\nor it is just the other way, so that the two supplement each other in\ninterpretation. That the different dreams of the same night are quite\nregularly in the interpretation to be treated as a whole I have already\nshown by examples.\nIn the best interpreted dreams we must often leave one portion in\nobscurity because we observe in the interpretation that it represents\nthe beginning of a tangle of dream thoughts which cannot be unravelled\nbut which has furnished no new contribution to the dream content. This,\nthen, is the keystone of the dream, the place at which it mounts into\nthe unknown. For the dream thoughts which we come upon in the\ninterpretation must generally remain without a termination, and merge in\nall directions into the net-like entanglement of our world of thoughts.\nIt is from some denser portion of this texture that the dream-wish then\narises like the mushroom from its mycelium.\nLet us now return to the facts of dream-forgetting, as we have really\nneglected to draw an important conclusion from them. If the waking life\nshows an unmistakable intention to forget the dream formed at night,\neither as a whole, immediately after awakening, or in fragments during\nthe course of the day, and if we recognise as the chief participator in\nthis forgetting the psychic resistance against the dream which has\nalready performed its part in opposing the dream at night\u2014then the\nquestion arises, What has the dream formation actually accomplished\nagainst this resistance? Let us consider the most striking case in which\nthe waking life has done away with the dream as though it had never\nhappened. If we take into consideration the play of the psychic forces,\nwe are forced to assert that the dream would have never come into\nexistence had the resistance held sway during the night as during the\nday. We conclude then, that the resistance loses a part of its force\nduring the night; we know that it has not been extinguished, as we have\ndemonstrated its interest in the dream formation in the production of\nthe distortion. We have, then, forced upon us the possibility that it\nabates at night, that the dream formation has become possible with this\ndiminution of the resistance, and we thus readily understand that,\nhaving regained its full power with the awakening, it immediately sets\naside what it was forced to admit as long as it was in abeyance.\nDescriptive psychology teaches us that the chief determinant in dream\nformation is the dormant state of the mind. We may now add the following\nelucidation: _The sleeping state makes dream formation possible by\ndiminishing the endopsychic censor._\nWe are certainly tempted to look upon this conclusion as the only one\npossible from the facts of dream-forgetting, and to develop from it\nfurther deductions concerning the proportions of energy in the sleeping\nand waking states. But we shall stop here for the present. When we have\npenetrated somewhat deeper into the psychology of the dream we shall\nfind that the origin of the dream formation may be differently\nconceived. The resistance operating to prevent the dream thoughts coming\nto consciousness may perhaps be eluded without suffering diminution _per\nse_. It is also plausible that both the factors favourable to dream\nformation, the diminution as well as the eluding of the resistance, may\nbe made possible simultaneously through the sleeping state. But we shall\npause here, and continue this line of thought later.\nThere is another series of objections against our procedure in the dream\ninterpretation which we must now consider. In this interpretation we\nproceed by dropping all the end-presentations which otherwise control\nreflection, we direct our attention to an individual element of the\ndream, and then note the unwished-for thoughts that occur to us in this\nconnection. We then take up the next component of the dream content, and\nrepeat the operation with it; and, without caring in what direction the\nthoughts take us, we allow ourselves to be led on by them until we end\nby rambling from one subject to another. At the same time, we harbour\nthe confident hope that we may in the end, without effort, come upon the\ndream thoughts from which our dream originated. Against this the critic\nbrings the following objection: That one can arrive somewhere, starting\nfrom a single element in the dream is nothing wonderful. Something can\nbe associatively connected with every idea. It is remarkable only that\none should succeed in hitting the dream thoughts in this aimless and\narbitrary excursion of thought. It is probably a self-deception; the\ninvestigator follows the chain of association from one element until for\nsome reason it is seen to break, when a second element is taken up; it\nis thus but natural that the association, originally unbounded, should\nnow experience a narrowing. He keeps in mind the former chain of\nassociations, and he will therefore in analysis more easily hit upon\ncertain thoughts which have something in common with the thoughts from\nthe first chain. He then imagines that he has found a thought which\nrepresents a point of junction between two elements of the dream. As he,\nmoreover, allows himself every freedom of thought connection, excepting\nonly the transitions from one idea to another which are made in normal\nthinking, it is not finally difficult for him to concoct something which\nhe calls the dream thought out of a series of \u201cintermediary thoughts\u201d;\nand without any guarantee, as they are otherwise unknown, he palms these\noff as the psychic equivalent of the dream. But all this is accompanied\nby arbitrary procedure and over-ingenious exploitation of coincidence.\nAnyone who will go to this useless trouble can in this way work out any\ndesired interpretation for any dream whatever.\nIf such objections are really advanced against us, we may refer in our\ndefence to the agreement of our dream interpretations, to the surprising\nconnections with other dream elements which appear in following out the\ndifferent particular presentations, and to the improbability that\nanything which so perfectly covers and explains the dream as our dream\ninterpretations do could be gained otherwise than by following psychic\nconnections previously established. We can also justify ourselves by the\nfact that the method of dream analysis is identical with the method used\nin the solution of hysterical symptoms, where the correctness of the\nmethod is attested through the emergence and fading away of the\nsymptoms\u2014that is, where the elucidation of the text by the interposed\nillustrations finds corroboration. But we have no object in avoiding\nthis problem\u2014how one can reach to a pre-established aim by following a\nchain of thoughts spun out thus arbitrarily and aimlessly\u2014for, though we\nare unable to solve the problem, we can get rid of it entirely.\nIt is in fact demonstrably incorrect to state that we abandon ourselves\nto an aimless course of thought when, as in the interpretation of\ndreams, we relinquish our reflection and allow the unwished-for idea to\ncome to the surface. It can be shown that we can reject only those\nend-presentations that are familiar to us, and that as soon as these\nstop the unknown, or, as we say more precisely, the unconscious\nend-presentations, immediately come into play, which now determined the\ncourse of the unwished-for presentations. A mode of thinking without\nend-idea can surely not be brought about through any influence we can\nexert on our own mental life; nor do I know either of any state of\npsychic derangement in which such mode of thought establishes itself.\nThe psychiatrists have in this field much too early rejected the\nsolidity of the psychic structure. I have ascertained that an\nunregulated stream of thoughts, devoid of the end-presentation, occurs\nas little in the realm of hysteria and paranoia as in the formation or\nsolution of dreams. Perhaps it does not appear at all in the endogenous\npsychic affections, but even the deliria of confused states are senseful\naccording to the ingenious theory of Leuret and become incomprehensible\nto us only through omissions. I have come to the same conviction\nwherever I have found opportunity for observation. The deliria are the\nwork of a censor which no longer makes any effort to conceal its sway,\nwhich, instead of lending its support to a revision no longer obnoxious\nto it, cancels regardlessly that which it raises objections against,\nthus causing the remnant to appear disconnected. This censor behaves\nanalogously to the Russian newspaper censor on the frontier, who allows\nto fall into the hands of his protected readers only those foreign\njournals that have passed under the black pencil.\nThe free play of the presentations following any associative\nconcatenation perhaps makes its appearance in destructive organic brain\nlesions. What, however, is taken as such in the psychoneuroses can\nalways be explained as the influence of the censor on a series of\nthoughts which have been pushed into the foreground by the concealed\nend-presentation.[FM] It has been considered an unmistakable sign of\nassociation free from the end-presentations when the emerging\npresentations (or pictures) were connected with one another by means of\nthe so-called superficial associations\u2014that is, by assonance, word\nambiguity, and causal connection without inner sense relationship; in\nother words, when they were connected through all those associations\nwhich we allow ourselves to make use of in wit and play upon words. This\ndistinguishing mark proves true for the connections of thought which\nlead us from the elements of the dream content to the collaterals, and\nfrom these to the thoughts of the dream proper; of this we have in our\ndream analysis found many surprising examples. No connection was there\ntoo loose and no wit too objectionable to serve as a bridge from one\nthought to another. But the correct understanding of such tolerance is\nnot remote. _Whenever one psychic element is connected with another\nthrough an obnoxious or superficial association, there also exists a\ncorrect and more profound connection between the two which succumbs to\nthe resistance of the censor._\nThe correct explanation for the predominance of the superficial\nassociations is the pressure of the censor, and not the suppression of\nthe end-presentations. The superficial associations supplant the deep\nones in the presentation whenever the censor renders the normal\nconnective paths impassable. It is as if in a mountainous region a\ngeneral interruption of traffic, _e.g._, an inundation, should render\nimpassable the long and broad thoroughfares; traffic would then have to\nbe maintained through inconvenient and steep footpaths otherwise used\nonly by the hunter.\nWe can here distinguish two cases which, however, are essentially one.\nIn the first case the censor is directed only against the connection of\nthe two thoughts, which, having been detached from each other, escape\nthe opposition. The two thoughts then enter successively into\nconsciousness; their connection remains concealed; but in its place\nthere occurs to us a superficial connection between the two which we\nwould not otherwise have thought of, and which as a rule connects with\nanother angle of the presentation complex instead of with the one giving\nrise to the suppressed but essential connection. Or, in the second case,\nboth thoughts on account of their content succumb to the censor; both\nthen appear not in their correct but in a modified substituted form; and\nboth substituted thoughts are so selected that they represent, through a\nsuperficial association, the essential relation which existed between\nthose which have been replaced by them. Under the pressure of the censor\nthe displacement of a normal and vital association by a superficial and\napparently absurd one has thus occurred in both cases.\nBecause we know of this displacement we unhesitatingly place reliance\neven upon superficial associations in the dream analysis.[FN]\nThe psychoanalysis of neurotics makes prolific use of the two axioms,\nfirst that with the abandonment of the conscious end-presentation the\ndomination of the train of presentation is transferred to the concealed\nend-presentations; and, secondly, that superficial associations are only\na substitutive displacement for suppressed and more profound ones;\nindeed, psychoanalysis raises these two axioms to pillars of its\ntechnique. When I request a patient to dismiss all reflection, and to\nreport to me whatever comes into his mind, I firmly cling to the\npresupposition that he will not be able to drop the end-idea of the\ntreatment, and I feel justified in concluding that what he reports, even\nthough seemingly most harmless and arbitrary, has connection with this\nmorbid state. My own personality is another end-presentation concerning\nwhich the patient has no inkling. The full appreciation, as well as the\ndetailed proof of both these explanations, belongs accordingly to the\ndescription of the psychoanalytic technique as a therapeutic method. We\nhave here reached one of the allied subjects with which we propose to\nleave the subject of the interpretation of dreams.[FO]\nOf all the objections only one is correct, and still remains, namely,\nthat we ought not to ascribe all mental occurrences of the\ninterpretation work to the nocturnal dream-work. In the interpretation\nin the waking state we are making a road running from the dream elements\nback to the dream thoughts. The dream-work has made its way in the\nopposite direction, and it is not at all probable that these roads are\nequally passable in the opposite directions. It has, on the contrary,\nbeen shown that during the day, by means of new thought connections we\nmake paths which strike the intermediate thoughts and the dream thoughts\nin different places. We can see how the recent thought material of the\nday takes its place in the groups of the interpretation, and probably\nalso forces the additional resistance appearing through the night to\nmake new and further detours. But the number and form of the collaterals\nwhich we thus spin during the day is psychologically perfectly\nnegligible if it only leads the way to the desired dream thoughts.\n(_b_) _Regression._\nNow that we have guarded against objection, or at least indicated where\nour weapons for defence rest, we need no longer delay entering upon the\npsychological investigations for which we have so long prepared. Let us\nbring together the main results of our investigations up to this point.\nThe dream is a momentous psychic act; its motive power is at all times\nto fulfil a wish; its indiscernibleness as a wish and its many\npeculiarities and absurdities are due to the influence of the psychic\ncensor to which it has been subjected during its formation. Apart from\nthe pressure to withdraw itself from this censor, the following have\nplayed a part in its formation: a strong tendency to the condensation of\npsychic material, a consideration for dramatisation into mental\npictures, and (though not regularly) a consideration for a rational and\nintelligible exterior in the dream structure. From every one of these\npropositions the road leads further to psychological postulates and\nassumptions. Thus the reciprocal relation of the wish motives and the\nfour conditions, as well as the relations of these conditions to one\nanother will have to be investigated; and the dream will have to be\nbrought into association with the psychic life.\nAt the beginning of this chapter we cited a dream in order to remind us\nof the riddles that are still unsolved. The interpretation of this dream\nof the burning child afforded us no difficulties, although it was not\nperfectly given in our present sense. We asked ourselves why it was\nnecessary, after all, that the father should dream instead of awakening,\nand we recognised the wish to represent the child as living as the\nsingle motive of the dream. That there was still another wish playing a\npart in this connection, we shall be able to show after later\ndiscussions. For the present, therefore, we may say that for the sake of\nthe wish-fulfilment the mental process of sleep was transformed into a\ndream.\nIf the wish realisation is made retrogressive, only one quality still\nremains which separates the two forms of psychic occurrences from each\nother. The dream thought might have read: \u201cI see a glimmer coming from\nthe room in which the corpse reposes. Perhaps a candle has been upset,\nand the child is burning!\u201d The dream reports the result of this\nreflection unchanged, but represents it in a situation which takes place\nin the present, and which is conceivable by the senses like an\nexperience in the waking state. This, however, is the most common and\nthe most striking psychological character of the dream; a thought,\nusually the one wished for, is in the dream made objective and\nrepresented as a scene, or, according to our belief, as experienced.\nBut how are we now to explain this characteristic peculiarity of the\ndream-work, or, to speak more modestly, how are we to bring it into\nrelation with the psychic processes?\nOn closer examination, it is plainly seen that there are two pronounced\ncharacters in the manifestations of the dream which are almost\nindependent of each other. The one is the representation as a present\nsituation with the omission of the \u201cperhaps\u201d; the other is the\ntransformation of the thought into visual pictures and into speech.\nThe transformation in the dream thoughts, which shifts into the present\nthe expectation expressed in them, is perhaps in this particular dream\nnot so very striking. This is probably in consonance with the special or\nrather subsidiary r\u00f4le of the wish-fulfilment in this dream. Let us take\nanother dream in which the dream-wish does not separate itself in sleep\nfrom a continuation of the waking thoughts, _e.g._, the dream of Irma\u2019s\ninjection. Here the dream thought reaching representation is in the\noptative, \u201cIf Otto could only be blamed for Irma\u2019s sickness!\u201d The dream\nsuppresses the optative, and replaces it by a simple present, \u201cYes, Otto\nis to blame for Irma\u2019s sickness.\u201d This is therefore the first of the\nchanges which even the undistorted dream undertakes with the dream\nthought. But we shall not stop long at this first peculiarity of the\ndream. We elucidate it by a reference to the conscious phantasy, the day\ndream, which behaves similarly with its presentation content. When\nDaudet\u2019s Mr. Joyeuse wanders through the streets of Paris unemployed\nwhile his daughter is led to believe that he has a position and is in\nhis office, he likewise dreams in the present of circumstances that\nmight help him to obtain protection and a position. The dream therefore\nemploys the present in the same manner and with the same right as the\nday dream. The present is the tense in which the wish is represented as\nfulfilled.\nThe second quality, however, is peculiar to the dream as distinguished\nfrom the day dream, namely, that the presentation content is not\nthought, but changed into perceptible images to which we give credence\nand which we believe we experience. Let us add, however, that not all\ndreams show this transformation of presentation into perceptible images.\nThere are dreams which consist solely of thoughts to which we cannot,\nhowever, on that account deny the substantiality of dreams. My dream\n\u201cAutodidasker\u2014the waking phantasy with Professor N.\u201d\u2014is of that nature;\nit contains hardly more perceptible elements than if I had thought its\ncontent during the day. Moreover, every long dream contains elements\nwhich have not experienced the transformation into the perceptible, and\nwhich are simply thought or known as we are wont to think or know in our\nwaking state. We may also recall here that such transformation of ideas\ninto perceptible images does not occur in dreams only but also in\nhallucinations and visions which perhaps appear spontaneously in health\nor as symptoms in the psychoneuroses. In brief, the relation which we\nare investigating here is in no way an exclusive one; the fact remains,\nhowever, that where this character of the dream occurs, it appears to us\nas the most noteworthy, so that we cannot think of it apart from the\ndream life. Its explanation, however, requires a very detailed\ndiscussion.\nAmong all the observations on the theory of dreams to be found in\nauthorities on the subject, I should like to lay stress upon one as\nbeing worth mentioning. The great G. T. Fechner[35] expresses his belief\n(_Psychophysik_, Part II., p. 520), in connection with some discussion\ndevoted to the dream, that the seat of the dream is elsewhere than in\nthe waking ideation. No other theory enables us to conceive the special\nqualities of the dream life.\nThe idea which is placed at our disposal is one of psychic locality. We\nshall entirely ignore the fact that the psychic apparatus with which we\nare here dealing is also familiar to us as an anatomical specimen, and\nwe shall carefully avoid the temptation to determine the psychic\nlocality in any way anatomically. We shall remain on psychological\nground, and we shall think ourselves called upon only to conceive the\ninstrument which serves the psychic activities somewhat after the manner\nof a compound microscope, a photographic or other similar apparatus. The\npsychic locality, then, corresponds to a place within such an apparatus\nin which one of the primary elements of the picture comes into\nexistence. As is well known, there are in the microscope and telescope\npartly fanciful locations or regions in which no tangible portion of the\napparatus is located. I think it superfluous to apologise for the\nimperfections of this and all similar figures. These comparisons are\ndesigned only to assist us in our attempt to make clear the complication\nof the psychic activity by breaking up this activity and referring the\nsingle activities to the single component parts of the apparatus. No\none, so far as I know, has ever ventured to attempt to discover the\ncomposition of the psychic instrument through such analysis. I see no\nharm in such an attempt. I believe that we may give free rein to our\nassumptions provided we at the same time preserve our cool judgment and\ndo not take the scaffolding for the building. As we need nothing except\nauxiliary ideas for the first approach to any unknown subject, we shall\nprefer the crudest and most tangible hypothesis to all others.\nWe therefore conceive the psychic apparatus as a compound instrument,\nthe component parts of which let us call instances, or, for the sake of\nclearness, systems. We then entertain the expectation that these systems\nperhaps maintain a constant spatial relationship to each other like the\ndifferent systems of lenses of the telescope, one behind another.\nStrictly speaking, there is no need of assuming a real spatial\narrangement of the psychic system. It will serve our purpose if a firm\nsequence be established through the fact that in certain psychological\noccurrences the system will be traversed by the excitement in a definite\nchronological order. This sequence may experience an alteration in other\nprocesses; such possibility may be left open. For the sake of brevity,\nwe shall henceforth speak of the component parts of the apparatus as\n\u201c\u03a8-systems.\u201d\nThe first thing that strikes us is the fact that the apparatus composed\nof \u03a8-systems has a direction. All our psychic activities proceed from\n(inner or outer) stimuli and terminate in innervations. We thus ascribe\nto the apparatus a sensible and a motor end; at the sensible end we find\na system which receives the perceptions, and at the motor end another\nwhich opens the locks of motility. The psychic process generally takes\nits course from the perception end to the motility end. The most common\nscheme of the psychic apparatus has therefore the following appearance:\n[Illustration: FIG. 1.]\nBut this is only in compliance with the demand long familiar to us, that\nthe psychic apparatus must be constructed like a reflex apparatus. The\nreflex act remains the model for every psychic activity.\nWe have now reason to admit a first differentiation at the sensible end.\nThe perceptions that come to us leave a trace in our psychic apparatus\nwhich we may call a \u201cMemory trace.\u201d The function which relates to this\nmemory trace we call the memory. If we hold seriously to our resolution\nto connect the psychic processes into systems, the memory trace can then\nconsist only of lasting changes in the elements of the systems. But, as\nhas already been shown in other places, obvious difficulties arise if\none and the same system faithfully preserves changes in its elements and\nstill remains fresh and capable of admitting new motives for change.\nFollowing the principle which directs our undertaking, we shall\ndistribute these two activities among two different systems. We assume\nthat a first system of the apparatus takes up the stimuli of perception,\nbut retains nothing from them\u2014that is, it has no memory; and that behind\nthis there lies a second system which transforms the momentary\nexcitement of the first into lasting traces. This would then be a\ndiagram of our psychic apparatus:\n[Illustration: FIG. 2.]\nIt is known that from the perceptions that act on the P-system we retain\nsomething else as lasting as the content itself. Our perceptions prove\nto be connected with one another in memory, and this is especially the\ncase when they have once fallen together in simultaneity. We call this\nthe fact of association. It is now clear that if the P-system is\nentirely lacking in memory, it certainly cannot preserve traces for the\nassociations; the individual P-elements would be intolerably hindered in\ntheir function if a remnant of former connection should make its\ninfluence felt against a new perception. Hence we must, on the contrary,\nassume that the memory system is the basis of the association. The fact\nof the association, then, consists in this\u2014that, in consequence of the\ndiminutions in resistance and a smoothing of the ways from one of the\nMem-elements, the excitement transmits itself to a second rather than to\na third Mem-system.\nOn further investigation we find it necessary to assume not one but many\nsuch Mem-systems, in which the same excitement propagated by the\nP-elements experiences a diversified fixation. The first of these\nMem-systems will contain in any case the fixation of the association\nthrough simultaneity, while in those lying further away the same\nexciting material will be arranged according to other forms of\nconcurrence; so that relationships of similarity, &c., might perhaps be\nrepresented through these later systems. It would naturally be idle to\nattempt to report in words the psychic significance of such a system.\nIts characteristic would lie in the intimacy of its relations to\nelements of raw memory material\u2014that is, if we wish to point to a\nprofounder theory in the gradations of the resistances to conduction\ntoward these elements.\nWe may insert here an observation of a general nature which points\nperhaps to something of importance. The P-system, which possesses no\ncapability of preserving changes and hence no memory, furnishes for our\nconsciousness the entire manifoldness of the sensible qualities. Our\nmemories, on the other hand, are unconscious in themselves; those that\nare most deeply impressed form no exception. They can be made conscious,\nbut there can be no doubt that they develop all their influences in the\nunconscious state. What we term our character is based, to be sure, on\nthe memory traces of our impressions, and indeed on these impressions\nthat have affected us most strongly, those of our early youth\u2014those that\nalmost never become conscious. But when memories become conscious again\nthey show no sensible quality or a very slight one in comparison to the\nperceptions. If, now, it can be confirmed _that memory and quality\nexclude each other, as far as consciousness in the \u03a8-systems is\nconcerned_, a most promising insight reveals itself to us in the\ndeterminations of the neuron excitement.\nWhat we have so far assumed concerning the composition of the psychic\napparatus at the sensible end follows regardless of the dream and the\npsychological explanations derived from it. The dream, however, serves\nas a source of proof for the knowledge of another part of the apparatus.\nWe have seen that it became impossible to explain the dream formation\nunless we ventured to assume two psychic instances, one of which\nsubjected the activity of the other to a critique as a consequence of\nwhich the exclusion from consciousness resulted.\nWe have seen that the criticising instance entertains closer relations\nwith consciousness than the criticised. The former stands between the\nlatter and consciousness like a screen. We have, moreover, found\nessential reasons for identifying the criticising instance with that\nwhich directs our waking life and determines our voluntary conscious\nactions. If we now replace these instances in the development of our\ntheory by systems, the criticising system is then to be ascribed to the\nmotor end because of the fact just mentioned. We now enter both systems\nin our scheme, and express by the names given them their relation to\nconsciousness.\n[Illustration: FIG. 3.]\nThe last of the systems at the motor end we call the foreconscious in\norder to denote that exciting processes in this system can reach\nconsciousness without any further detention provided certain other\nconditions be fulfilled, _e.g._, the attainment of a certain intensity,\na certain distribution of that function which must be called attention,\nand the like. This is at the same time the system which possesses the\nkeys to voluntary motility. The system behind it we call the unconscious\nbecause it has no access to consciousness except through the\nforeconscious, in the passage through which its excitement must submit\nto certain changes.\nIn which of these systems, now, do we localise the impulse to the dream\nformation? For the Sake of simplicity, let us say in the system Unc. To\nbe sure we shall find in later discussions that this is not quite\ncorrect, that the dream formation is forced to connect with dream\nthoughts which belong to the system of the foreconscious. But we shall\nlearn later, when we come to deal with the dream-wish, that the motive\npower for the dream is furnished by the Unc., and, owing to this latter\nmovement, we shall assume the unconscious system as the starting-point\nof the dream formation. This dream impulse, like all other thought\nstructures, will now strive to continue itself in the foreconscious, and\nthence to gain admission to consciousness.\nExperience teaches us that the road leading from the foreconscious to\nconsciousness is closed to the dream thoughts during the day by the\nresistance of the censor. At night the dream thoughts gain admission to\nconsciousness, but the question arises, in what way and because of what\nchange. If this admission was rendered possible to the dream thoughts\nthrough the fact that the resistance watching on the boundary between\nthe unconscious and foreconscious sinks at night, we should then get\ndreams in the material of our presentations which did not show the\nhallucinatory character which just now interests us.\nThe sinking of the censor between the two systems, Unc. and Forec., can\nexplain to us only such dreams as \u201cAutodidasker,\u201d but not dreams like\nthe one of the burning child, which we have taken as a problem at the\noutset in these present investigations.\nWhat takes place in the hallucinatory dream we can describe in no other\nway than by saying that the excitement takes a retrogressive course. It\ntakes its station, not at the motor end of the apparatus, but at the\nsensible end, and finally reaches the system of the perceptions. If we\ncall the direction towards which the psychic process continues from the\nunconscious into the waking state the progressive, we may then speak of\nthe dream as having a regressive character.\nThis regression is surely one of the most important peculiarities of the\ndream process; but we must not forget that it does not belong to the\ndream alone. The intentional recollection and other processes of our\nnormal thinking also require a retrogression in the psychic apparatus\nfrom any complex presentation act to the raw material of the memory\ntraces lying at its basis. But during the waking state this turning\nbackward does not reach beyond the memory pictures; it is unable to\nproduce the hallucinatory vividness of the perception pictures. Why is\nthis different in the dream? When we spoke of the condensation work of\nthe dream we could not avoid the assumption that the intensities\nadhering to the presentations are fully transferred from one to another\nthrough the dream-work. It is probably this modification of the former\npsychic process which makes possible the occupation of the system of P\nto its full sensual vividness in the opposite direction from thought.\nI hope that we are far from deluding ourselves about the importance of\nthis present discussion. We have done nothing more than give a name to\nan inexplicable phenomenon. We call it regression if the presentation in\nthe dream is changed back to the perceptible image from which it once\noriginated. But even this step demands justification. Why this naming,\nif it does not teach us anything new? I believe, however, that the name\n\u201cRegression\u201d will serve us to the extent of connecting a fact familiar\nto us with a scheme of the psychic apparatus which is supplied with a\ndirection. At this point, for the first time, it is worth the trouble to\nconstruct such a scheme. For, with the help of this scheme, any other\npeculiarity of the dream formation will become clear to us without\nfurther reflection. If we look upon the dream as a process of regression\nin the assumed psychic apparatus, we can readily understand the\nempirically proven fact that all mental relation of the dream thoughts\neither is lost in the dream-work or can come to expression only with\ndifficulty. According to our scheme, these mental relations are\ncontained not in the first Mem-systems, but in those lying further to\nthe front, and in the regression they must forfeit their expression in\nfavour of the perception pictures. _The structure of the dream thoughts\nis in the regression broken up into its raw material._\nBut what change renders possible this regression which is impossible\nduring the day? Let us here be content with assumption. There must\nevidently be some alterations in the charge of energy belonging to the\nsingle systems causing the latter to become accessible or inaccessible\nto the discharge of the excitement; but in any such apparatus the same\neffect upon the course of excitement might be brought about through more\nthan one form of such changes. This naturally reminds us of the state of\nsleep and of the many changes of energy this state produces at the\nsensible end of the apparatus. During the day there is a continuous\ncoursing stream from the \u03a8-system of the P toward the motility; this\ncurrent ceases at night, and no longer hinders a streaming of the\ncurrent of excitement in the opposite direction. This would appear to be\nthat \u201cseclusion from the outer world\u201d which according to the theory of\nsome authors is supposed to explain the psychological character of the\ndream (_vide_ p. 30). In the explanation of the regression of the dream\nwe shall, however, have to consider those other regressions which\noriginate during morbid waking states. In these other forms the\nexplanation just given plainly leaves us in the lurch. Regression takes\nplace in spite of the uninterrupted sensible current in a progressive\ndirection.\nThe hallucinations of hysteria and paranoia, as well as the visions of\nmentally normal persons, I can explain as actually corresponding to\nregressions, being in fact thoughts transformed into images; and only\nsuch thoughts are subjected to this transformation as are in intimate\nconnection with suppressed or unconscious recollections. As an example I\nshall cite one of my youngest hysterical patients\u2014a boy, twelve years\nold, who was prevented from falling asleep by \u201c_green faces with red\neyes_,\u201d which terrified him. The source of this manifestation was the\nsuppressed, but once conscious, memory of a boy whom he had often seen\nduring four years, and who offered him a deterring example of many\nchildish bad habits, including onanism, which now formed the subject of\nhis own reproach. His mother had noticed at the time that the complexion\nof the ill-bred boy was greenish and that he had _red_ (_i.e. red\nbordered_) _eyes_. Hence the terrible vision which constantly served to\nremind him of his mother\u2019s warning that such boys become demented, that\nthey are unable to make progress at school, and are doomed to an early\ndeath. A part of this prediction came true in the case of the little\npatient; he could not successfully pursue his high school studies, and,\nas appeared on examination of his involuntary fancies, he stood in great\ndread of the remainder of the prophecy. However, after a brief period of\nsuccessful treatment, his sleep was restored, he lost his fears, and\nfinished his scholastic year with an excellent record.\nI may also add here the interpretation of a vision related to me by an\nhysteric forty years of age, as having occurred in her normal life. On\nopening her eyes one morning she beheld in the room her brother, whom\nshe knew to be confined in an insane asylum. Her little son was asleep\nby her side. Lest the child should be frightened on seeing his uncle,\nand fall into convulsions, she pulled the sheet over the little one;\nthis done, the phantom disappeared. This vision is the re-casting of one\nof her infantile reminiscences which, although conscious, is most\nintimately connected with all the unconscious material in her mind. Her\nnursemaid told her that her mother, who had died young (the patient was\nthen only a year and a half old), had suffered from epileptic or\nhysterical convulsions, which dated back to a fright caused by her\nbrother (the patient\u2019s uncle), who appeared to her disguised as a\nspectre with a sheet over his head. The vision contains the same\nelements as the reminiscence, viz. the appearance of the brother, the\nsheet, the fright, and its effect. These elements, however, are ranged\nin different relations, and are transferred to other persons. The\nobvious motive of the vision, which replaces the idea, is her solicitude\nlest her little son, who bore a striking resemblance to his uncle,\nshould share the latter\u2019s fate. Both examples here cited are not\nentirely unrelated to sleep, and may therefore be unsuitable as proof\nfor my assertion. I may therefore refer to my analysis of an\nhallucinatory paranoia,[FP] and to the results of my hitherto\nunpublished studies on the psychology of the psychoneuroses in order to\nemphasize the fact that in these cases of regressive thought\ntransformation one must not overlook the influence of a suppressed or\nunconscious reminiscence, this being in most cases of an infantile\ncharacter. This recollection, so to speak, draws into the regression the\nthought with which it is connected, which is prevented from expression\nby the censor\u2014that is, into that form of representation in which the\nrecollection itself exists psychically. I may here mention as a result\nof my studies in hysteria that if we succeed in restoring infantile\nscenes to consciousness (whether recollections or fancies) they are seen\nas hallucinations, and are divested of this character only after\nreproduction. It is also known that the earliest infantile memories\nretain the character of perceptible vividness until late in life, even\nin persons who are otherwise not visual in memory.\nIf, now, we keep in mind what part is played in the dream thoughts by\nthe infantile reminiscences or the phantasies based upon them, how often\nfragments of these reminiscences emerge in the dream content, and how\noften they even give origin to dream wishes, we cannot deny the\nprobability that in the dream, too, the transformation of thoughts into\nvisual images may be the result of the attraction exerted by the\nvisually represented reminiscences, striving for reanimation, upon the\nthoughts severed from consciousness and struggling for expression.\nFollowing this conception, we may further describe the dream as a\nmodified substitute for the infantile scene produced by transference to\nrecent material. The infantile cannot enforce its renewal, and must\ntherefore be satisfied to return as a dream.\nThis reference to the significance of the infantile scenes (or of their\nphantastic repetitions), as in a manner furnishing the pattern for the\ndream content, renders superfluous the assumption made by Scherner and\nhis pupils, of an inner source of excitement. Scherner assumes a state\nof \u201cvisual excitation\u201d of internal excitement in the organ of sight when\nthe dreams manifest a particular vividness or a special abundance of\nvisual elements. We need not object to this assumption, but may be\nsatisfied with establishing such state of excitation for the psychic\nperceptive system of the organs of vision only; we shall, however,\nassert that this state of excitation is formed through the memory, and\nis merely a refreshing of the former actual visual excitation. I cannot,\nfrom my own experience, give a good example showing such an influence of\ninfantile reminiscence; my own dreams are surely less rich in\nperceptible elements than I must fancy those of others; but in my most\nbeautiful and most vivid dream of late years I can easily trace the\nhallucinatory distinctness of the dream contents to the sensuous nature\nof recently received impressions. On page 368 I mentioned a dream in\nwhich the dark blue colour of the water, the brown colour of the smoke\nissuing from the ship\u2019s funnels, and the sombre brown and red of the\nbuildings which I had seen made a profound and lasting impression on my\nmind. This dream, if any, must be attributed to visual excitation. But\nwhat has brought my visual organ into this excitable state? It was a\nrecent impression uniting itself with a series of former ones. The\ncolours I beheld were those of the toy blocks with which my children\nerected a grand structure for my admiration on the day preceding the\ndream. The same sombre red colour covered the large blocks and the same\nblue and brown the small ones. Connected with these were the colour\nimpression of my last journey in Italy, the charming blue of the Isonzo\nand the Lagoon, the brown hue of the Alpine region. The beautiful\ncolours seen in the dream were but a repetition of those seen in the\nmemory.\nLet us review what we have learned about this peculiarity which the\ndream has of transforming its content of ideas into plastic images. We\nhave neither explained this character of the dream-work nor traced it to\nknown laws of psychology, but we have singled it out as pointing to\nunknown connections, and designated it by the name of the \u201cregredient\u201d\ncharacter. Wherever this regression has occurred, we have regarded it as\nan effect of the resistance which opposes the progress of the thought on\nits normal way to consciousness, as well as a result of the simultaneous\nattraction exerted upon it by the vivid memories present. Regression is\nperhaps facilitated in the dream by the cessation of the progressive\nstream running from the sense organs during the day. For this auxiliary\nmoment there must be compensation in the other forms of regression\nthrough a fortifying of the other motives of regression. We must also\nbear in mind that in pathological cases of regression, as in the dream,\nthe process of transference of energy must be different from that of the\nregressions of normal psychic life, as it renders possible a full\nhallucinatory occupation of the perception systems. What we have\ndescribed in the analysis of the dream-work as \u201cRegard for Dramatic\nFitness\u201d may be referred to the selective attraction of visually\nrecollected scenes, touched by the dream thoughts.\nIt is quite possible that this first part of our psychological\nutilisation of the dream does not entirely satisfy even us. We must,\nhowever, console ourselves with the fact that we are compelled to build\nin the dark. If we have not altogether strayed from the right path, we\nshall be sure to reach about the same ground from another\nstarting-point, and thereafter perhaps be better able to see our way.\n(_c_) _The Wish-Fulfilment._\nThe dream of the burning child cited above affords us a welcome\nopportunity for appreciating the difficulties confronting the theory of\nwish-fulfilment. That the dream should be nothing but a wish-fulfilment\nsurely seemed strange to us all\u2014and that not alone because of the\ncontradictions offered by the anxiety dream.\nAfter learning from the first analytical explanations that the dream\nconceals sense and psychic validity, we could hardly expect so simple a\ndetermination of this sense. According to the correct but concise\ndefinition of Aristotle, the dream is a continuation of thinking in\nsleep (in so far as one sleeps). Considering that during the day our\nthoughts produce such a diversity of psychic acts\u2014judgments,\nconclusions, contradictions, expectations, intentions, &c.\u2014why should\nour sleeping thoughts be forced to confine themselves to the production\nof wishes? Are there not, on the contrary, many dreams that present a\ndifferent psychic act in dream form, _e.g._, a solicitude, and is not\nthe very transparent father\u2019s dream mentioned above of just such a\nnature? From the gleam of light falling into his eyes while asleep the\nfather draws the solicitous conclusion that a candle has been upset and\nmay have set fire to the corpse; he transforms this conclusion into a\ndream by investing it with a senseful situation enacted in the present\ntense. What part is played in this dream by the wish-fulfilment, and\nwhich are we to suspect\u2014the predominance of the thought continued from\nthe waking state or of the thought incited by the new sensory\nimpression?\nAll these considerations are just, and force us to enter more deeply\ninto the part played by the wish-fulfilment in the dream, and into the\nsignificance of the waking thoughts continued in sleep.\nIt is in fact the wish-fulfilment that has already induced us to\nseparate dreams into two groups. We have found some dreams that were\nplainly wish-fulfilments; and others in which wish-fulfilment could not\nbe recognised, and was frequently concealed by every available means. In\nthis latter class of dreams we recognised the influence of the dream\ncensor. The undisguised wish dreams were chiefly found in children, yet\nfleeting open-hearted wish dreams _seemed_ (I purposely emphasize this\nword) to occur also in adults.\nWe may now ask whence the wish fulfilled in the dream originates. But to\nwhat opposition or to what diversity do we refer this \u201cwhence\u201d? I think\nit is to the opposition between conscious daily life and a psychic\nactivity remaining unconscious which can only make itself noticeable\nduring the night. I thus find a threefold possibility for the origin of\na wish. Firstly, it may have been incited during the day, and owing to\nexternal circumstances failed to find gratification, there is thus left\nfor the night an acknowledged but unfulfilled wish. Secondly, it may\ncome to the surface during the day but be rejected, leaving an\nunfulfilled but suppressed wish. Or, thirdly, it may have no relation to\ndaily life, and belong to those wishes that originate during the night\nfrom the suppression. If we now follow our scheme of the psychic\napparatus, we can localise a wish of the first order in the system\nForec. We may assume that a wish of the second order has been forced\nback from the Forec. system into the Unc. system, where alone, if\nanywhere, it can maintain itself; while a wish-feeling of the third\norder we consider altogether incapable of leaving the Unc. system. This\nbrings up the question whether wishes arising from these different\nsources possess the same value for the dream, and whether they have the\nsame power to incite a dream.\nOn reviewing the dreams which we have at our disposal for answering this\nquestion, we are at once moved to add as a fourth source of the\ndream-wish the actual wish incitements arising during the night, such as\nthirst and sexual desire. It then becomes evident that the source of the\ndream-wish does not affect its capacity to incite a dream. This view is\nsupported by the dream of the little girl who continued the sea trip\ninterrupted during the day, and by the other children\u2019s dreams referred\nto; they are explained by an unfulfilled but not suppressed wish from\nthe day-time. That a wish suppressed during the day asserts itself in\nthe dream can be shown by a great many examples. I shall mention a very\nsimple example of this class. A somewhat sarcastic young lady, whose\nyounger friend has become engaged to be married, is asked throughout the\nday by her acquaintances whether she knows and what she thinks of the\nfianc\u00e9. She answers with unqualified praise, thereby silencing her own\njudgment, as she would prefer to tell the truth, namely, that he is an\nordinary person (Dutzendmensch).[FQ] The following night she dreams that\nthe same question is put to her, and that she replies with the formula:\n\u201cIn case of subsequent orders it will suffice to mention the number.\u201d\nFinally, we have learned from numerous analyses that the wish in all\ndreams that have been subject to distortion has been derived from the\nunconscious, and has been unable to come to perception in the waking\nstate. Thus it would appear that all wishes are of the same value and\nforce for the dream formation.\nI am at present unable to prove that the state of affairs is really\ndifferent, but I am strongly inclined to assume a more stringent\ndetermination of the dream-wish. Children\u2019s dreams leave no doubt that\nan unfulfilled wish of the day may be the instigator of the dream. But\nwe must not forget that it is, after all, the wish of a child, that it\nis a wish-feeling of infantile strength only. I have a strong doubt\nwhether an unfulfilled wish from the day would suffice to create a dream\nin an adult. It would rather seem that as we learn to control our\nimpulses by intellectual activity, we more and more reject as vain the\nformation or retention of such intense wishes as are natural to\nchildhood. In this, indeed, there may be individual variations; some\nretain the infantile type of psychic processes longer than others. The\ndifferences are here the same as those found in the gradual decline of\nthe originally distinct visual imagination.\nIn general, however, I am of the opinion that unfulfilled wishes of the\nday are insufficient to produce a dream in adults. I readily admit that\nthe wish instigators originating in conscious life contribute towards\nthe incitement of dreams, but that is probably all. The dream would not\noriginate if the foreconscious wish were not reinforced from another\nsource.\nThat source is the unconscious. I believe that _the conscious wish is a\ndream inciter only if it succeeds in arousing a similar unconscious wish\nwhich reinforces it_. Following the suggestions obtained through the\npsychoanalysis of the neuroses, I believe that these unconscious wishes\nare always active and ready for expression whenever they find an\nopportunity to unite themselves with an emotion from conscious life, and\nthat they transfer their greater intensity to the lesser intensity of\nthe latter.[FR] It may therefore seem that the conscious wish alone has\nbeen realised in a dream; but a slight peculiarity in the formation of\nthis dream will put us on the track of the powerful helper from the\nunconscious. These ever active and, as it were, immortal wishes from the\nunconscious recall the legendary Titans who from time immemorial have\nborne the ponderous mountains which were once rolled upon them by the\nvictorious gods, and which even now quiver from time to time from the\nconvulsions of their mighty limbs; I say that these wishes found in the\nrepression are of themselves of an infantile origin, as we have learned\nfrom the psychological investigation of the neuroses. I should like,\ntherefore, to withdraw the opinion previously expressed that it is\nunimportant whence the dream-wish originates, and replace it by another,\nas follows: _The wish manifested in the dream must be an infantile one._\nIn the adult it originates in the Unc., while in the child, where no\nseparation and censor as yet exist between Forec. and Unc., or where\nthese are only in the process of formation, it is an unfulfilled and\nunrepressed wish from the waking state. I am aware that this conception\ncannot be generally demonstrated, but I maintain nevertheless that it\ncan be frequently demonstrated, even where it was not suspected, and\nthat it cannot be generally refuted.\nThe wish-feelings which remain from the conscious waking state are,\ntherefore, relegated to the background in the dream formation. In the\ndream content I shall attribute to them only the part attributed to the\nmaterial of actual sensations during sleep (see p. 185). If I now take\ninto account those other psychic instigations remaining from the waking\nstate which are not wishes, I shall only adhere to the line mapped out\nfor me by this train of thought. We may succeed in provisionally\nterminating the sum of energy of our waking thoughts by deciding to go\nto sleep. He is a good sleeper who can do this; Napoleon I. is reputed\nto have been a model of this sort. But we do not always succeed in\naccomplishing it, or in accomplishing it perfectly. Unsolved problems,\nharassing cares, overwhelming impressions continue the thinking activity\neven during sleep, maintaining psychic processes in the system which we\nhave termed the foreconscious. These mental processes continuing into\nsleep may be divided into the following groups: 1, That which has not\nbeen terminated during the day owing to casual prevention; 2, that which\nhas been left unfinished by temporary paralysis of our mental power,\n_i.e._ the unsolved; 3, that which has been rejected and suppressed\nduring the day. This unites with a powerful group (4) formed by that\nwhich has been excited in our Unc. during the day by the work of the\nforeconscious. Finally, we may add group (5) consisting of the\nindifferent and hence unsettled impressions of the day.\nWe should not underrate the psychic intensities introduced into sleep by\nthese remnants of waking life, especially those emanating from the group\nof the unsolved. These excitations surely continue to strive for\nexpression during the night, and we may assume with equal certainty that\nthe sleeping state renders impossible the usual continuation of the\nexcitement in the foreconscious and the termination of the excitement by\nits becoming conscious. As far as we can normally become conscious of\nour mental processes, even during the night, in so far we are not\nasleep. I shall not venture to state what change is produced in the\nForec. system by the sleeping state, but there is no doubt that the\npsychological character of sleep is essentially due to the change of\nenergy in this very system, which also dominates the approach to\nmotility, which is paralysed during sleep. In contradistinction to this,\nthere seems to be nothing in the psychology of the dream to warrant the\nassumption that sleep produces any but secondary changes in the\nconditions of the Unc. system. Hence, for the nocturnal excitation in\nthe Forec. there remains no other path than that followed by the wish\nexcitements from the Unc. This excitation must seek reinforcement from\nthe Unc., and follow the detours of the unconscious excitations. But\nwhat is the relation of the foreconscious day remnants to the dream?\nThere is no doubt that they penetrate abundantly into the dream, that\nthey utilise the dream content to obtrude themselves upon consciousness\neven during the night; indeed, they occasionally even dominate the dream\ncontent, and impel it to continue the work of the day; it is also\ncertain that the day remnants may just as well have any other character\nas that of wishes; but it is highly instructive and even decisive for\nthe theory of wish-fulfilment to see what conditions they must comply\nwith in order to be received into the dream.\nLet us pick out one of the dreams cited above as examples, _e.g._, the\ndream in which my friend Otto seems to show the symptoms of Basedow\u2019s\ndisease (p. 228). My friend Otto\u2019s appearance occasioned me some concern\nduring the day, and this worry, like everything else referring to this\nperson, affected me. I may also assume that these feelings followed me\ninto sleep. I was probably bent on finding out what was the matter with\nhim. In the night my worry found expression in the dream which I have\nreported, the content of which was not only senseless, but failed to\nshow any wish-fulfilment. But I began to investigate for the source of\nthis incongruous expression of the solicitude felt during the day, and\nanalysis revealed the connection. I identified my friend Otto with a\ncertain Baron L. and myself with a Professor R. There was only one\nexplanation for my being impelled to select just this substitution for\nthe day thought. I must have always been prepared in the Unc. to\nidentify myself with Professor R., as it meant the realisation of one of\nthe immortal infantile wishes, viz. that of becoming great. Repulsive\nideas respecting my friend, that would certainly have been repudiated in\na waking state, took advantage of the opportunity to creep into the\ndream, but the worry of the day likewise found some form of expression\nthrough a substitution in the dream content. The day thought, which was\nno wish in itself but rather a worry, had in some way to find a\nconnection with the infantile now unconscious and suppressed wish, which\nthen allowed it, though already properly prepared, to \u201coriginate\u201d for\nconsciousness. The more dominating this worry, the stronger must be the\nconnection to be established; between the contents of the wish and that\nof the worry there need be no connection, nor was there one in any of\nour examples.\nWe can now sharply define the significance of the unconscious wish for\nthe dream. It may be admitted that there is a whole class of dreams in\nwhich the incitement originates preponderatingly or even exclusively\nfrom the remnants of daily life; and I believe that even my cherished\ndesire to become at some future time a \u201cprofessor extraordinarius\u201d would\nhave allowed me to slumber undisturbed that night had not my worry about\nmy friend\u2019s health been still active. But this worry alone would not\nhave produced a dream; the motive power needed by the dream had to be\ncontributed by a wish, and it was the affair of the worriment to procure\nfor itself such wish as a motive power of the dream. To speak\nfiguratively, it is quite possible that a day thought plays the part of\nthe contractor (_entrepreneur_) in the dream. But it is known that no\nmatter what idea the contractor may have in mind, and how desirous he\nmay be of putting it into operation, he can do nothing without capital;\nhe must depend upon a capitalist to defray the necessary expenses, and\nthis capitalist, who supplies the psychic expenditure for the dream is\ninvariably and indisputably _a wish from the unconscious_, no matter\nwhat the nature of the waking thought may be.\nIn other cases the capitalist himself is the contractor for the dream;\nthis, indeed, seems to be the more usual case. An unconscious wish is\nproduced by the day\u2019s work, which in turn creates the dream. The dream\nprocesses, moreover, run parallel with all the other possibilities of\nthe economic relationship used here as an illustration. Thus, the\nentrepreneur may contribute some capital himself, or several\nentrepreneurs may seek the aid of the same capitalist, or several\ncapitalists may jointly supply the capital required by the entrepreneur.\nThus there are dreams produced by more than one dream-wish, and many\nsimilar variations which may readily be passed over and are of no\nfurther interest to us. What we have left unfinished in this discussion\nof the dream-wish we shall be able to develop later.\nThe \u201ctertium comparationis\u201d in the comparisons just employed\u2014_i.e._ the\nsum placed at our free disposal in proper allotment\u2014admits of still\nfiner application for the illustration of the dream structure. As shown\non p. 285 we can recognise in most dreams a centre especially supplied\nwith perceptible intensity. This is regularly the direct representation\nof the wish-fulfilment; for, if we undo the displacements of the\ndream-work by a process of retrogression, we find that the psychic\nintensity of the elements in the dream thoughts is replaced by the\nperceptible intensity of the elements in the dream content. The elements\nadjoining the wish-fulfilment have frequently nothing to do with its\nsense, but prove to be descendants of painful thoughts which oppose the\nwish. But, owing to their frequently artificial connection with the\ncentral element, they have acquired sufficient intensity to enable them\nto come to expression. Thus, the force of expression of the\nwish-fulfilment is diffused over a certain sphere of association, within\nwhich it raises to expression all elements, including those that are in\nthemselves impotent. In dreams having several strong wishes we can\nreadily separate from one another the spheres of the individual\nwish-fulfilments; the gaps in the dream likewise can often be explained\nas boundary zones.\nAlthough the foregoing remarks have considerably limited the\nsignificance of the day remnants for the dream, it will nevertheless be\nworth our while to give them some attention. For they must be a\nnecessary ingredient in the formation of the dream, inasmuch as\nexperience reveals the surprising fact that every dream shows in its\ncontent a connection with some impression of a recent day, often of the\nmost indifferent kind. So far we have failed to see any necessity for\nthis addition to the dream mixture (p. 153). This necessity appears only\nwhen we follow closely the part played by the unconscious wish, and then\nseek information in the psychology of the neuroses. We thus learn that\nthe unconscious idea, as such, is altogether incapable of entering into\nthe foreconscious, and that it can exert an influence there only by\nuniting with a harmless idea already belonging to the foreconscious, to\nwhich it transfers its intensity and under which it allows itself to be\nconcealed. This is the fact of transference which furnishes an\nexplanation for so many surprising occurrences in the psychic life of\nneurotics.\nThe idea from the foreconscious which thus obtains an unmerited\nabundance of intensity may be left unchanged by the transference, or it\nmay have forced upon it a modification from the content of the\ntransferring idea. I trust the reader will pardon my fondness for\ncomparisons from daily life, but I feel tempted to say that the\nrelations existing for the repressed idea are similar to the situations\nexisting in Austria for the American dentist, who is forbidden to\npractise unless he gets permission from a regular physician to use his\nname on the public signboard and thus cover the legal requirements.\nMoreover, just as it is naturally not the busiest physicians who form\nsuch alliances with dental practitioners, so in the psychic life only\nsuch foreconscious or conscious ideas are chosen to cover a repressed\nidea as have not themselves attracted much of the attention which is\noperative in the foreconscious. The unconscious entangles with its\nconnections preferentially either those impressions and ideas of the\nforeconscious which have been left unnoticed as indifferent, or those\nthat have soon been deprived of this attention through rejection. It is\na familiar fact from the association studies confirmed by every\nexperience, that ideas which have formed intimate connections in one\ndirection assume an almost negative attitude to whole groups of new\nconnections. I once tried from this principle to develop a theory for\nhysterical paralysis.\nIf we assume that the same need for the transference of the repressed\nideas which we have learned to know from the analysis of the neuroses\nmakes its influence felt in the dream as well, we can at once explain\ntwo riddles of the dream, viz. that every dream analysis shows an\ninterweaving of a recent impression, and that this recent element is\nfrequently of the most indifferent character. We may add what we have\nalready learned elsewhere, that these recent and indifferent elements\ncome so frequently into the dream content as a substitute for the most\ndeep-lying of the dream thoughts, for the further reason that they have\nleast to fear from the resisting censor. But while this freedom from\ncensorship explains only the preference for trivial elements, the\nconstant presence of recent elements points to the fact that there is a\nneed for transference. Both groups of impressions satisfy the demand of\nthe repression for material still free from associations, the\nindifferent ones because they have offered no inducement for extensive\nassociations, and the recent ones because they have had insufficient\ntime to form such associations.\nWe thus see that the day remnants, among which we may now include the\nindifferent impressions when they participate in the dream formation,\nnot only borrow from the Unc. the motive power at the disposal of the\nrepressed wish, but also offer to the unconscious something\nindispensable, namely, the attachment necessary to the transference. If\nwe here attempted to penetrate more deeply into the psychic processes,\nwe should first have to throw more light on the play of emotions between\nthe foreconscious and the unconscious, to which, indeed, we are urged by\nthe study of the psychoneuroses, whereas the dream itself offers no\nassistance in this respect.\nJust one further remark about the day remnants. There is no doubt that\nthey are the actual disturbers of sleep, and not the dream, which, on\nthe contrary, strives to guard sleep. But we shall return to this point\nlater.\nWe have so far discussed the dream-wish, we have traced it to the sphere\nof the Unc., and analysed its relations to the day remnants, which in\nturn may be either wishes, psychic emotions of any other kind, or simply\nrecent impressions. We have thus made room for any claims that may be\nmade for the importance of conscious thought activity in dream\nformations in all its variations. Relying upon our thought series, it\nwould not be at all impossible for us to explain even those extreme\ncases in which the dream as a continuer of the day work brings to a\nhappy conclusion an unsolved problem of the waking state. We do not,\nhowever, possess an example, the analysis of which might reveal the\ninfantile or repressed wish source furnishing such alliance and\nsuccessful strengthening of the efforts of the foreconscious activity.\nBut we have not come one step nearer a solution of the riddle: Why can\nthe unconscious furnish the motive power for the wish-fulfilment only\nduring sleep? The answer to this question must throw light on the\npsychic nature of wishes; and it will be given with the aid of the\ndiagram of the psychic apparatus.\nWe do not doubt that even this apparatus attained its present perfection\nthrough a long course of development. Let us attempt to restore it as it\nexisted in an early phase of its activity. From assumptions, to be\nconfirmed elsewhere, we know that at first the apparatus strove to keep\nas free from excitement as possible, and in its first formation,\ntherefore, the scheme took the form of a reflex apparatus, which enabled\nit promptly to discharge through the motor tracts any sensible stimulus\nreaching it from without. But this simple function was disturbed by the\nwants of life, which likewise furnish the impulse for the further\ndevelopment of the apparatus. The wants of life first manifested\nthemselves to it in the form of the great physical needs. The excitement\naroused by the inner want seeks an outlet in motility, which may be\ndesignated as \u201cinner changes\u201d or as an \u201cexpression of the emotions.\u201d The\nhungry child cries or fidgets helplessly, but its situation remains\nunchanged; for the excitation proceeding from an inner want requires,\nnot a momentary outbreak, but a force working continuously. A change can\noccur only if in some way a feeling of gratification is\nexperienced\u2014which in the case of the child must be through outside\nhelp\u2014in order to remove the inner excitement. An essential constituent\nof this experience is the appearance of a certain perception (of food in\nour example), the memory picture of which thereafter remains associated\nwith the memory trace of the excitation of want.\nThanks to the established connection, there results at the next\nappearance of this want a psychic feeling which revives the memory\npicture of the former perception, and thus recalls the former perception\nitself, _i.e._ it actually re-establishes the situation of the first\ngratification. We call such a feeling a wish; the reappearance of the\nperception constitutes the wish-fulfilment, and the full revival of the\nperception by the want excitement constitutes the shortest road to the\nwish-fulfilment. We may assume a primitive condition of the psychic\napparatus in which this road is really followed, _i.e._ where the\nwishing merges into an hallucination. This first psychic activity\ntherefore aims at an identity of perception, _i.e._ it aims at a\nrepetition of that perception which is connected with the fulfilment of\nthe want.\nThis primitive mental activity must have been modified by bitter\npractical experience into a more expedient secondary activity. The\nestablishment of the identity perception on the short regressive road\nwithin the apparatus does not in another respect carry with it the\nresult which inevitably follows the revival of the same perception from\nwithout. The gratification does not take place, and the want continues.\nIn order to equalise the internal with the external sum of energy, the\nformer must be continually maintained, just as actually happens in the\nhallucinatory psychoses and in the deliriums of hunger which exhaust\ntheir psychic capacity in clinging to the object desired. In order to\nmake more appropriate use of the psychic force, it becomes necessary to\ninhibit the full regression so as to prevent it from extending beyond\nthe image of memory, whence it can select other paths leading ultimately\nto the establishment of the desired identity from the outer world. This\ninhibition and consequent deviation from the excitation becomes the task\nof a second system which dominates the voluntary motility, _i.e._\nthrough whose activity the expenditure of motility is now devoted to\npreviously recalled purposes. But this entire complicated mental\nactivity which works its way from the memory picture to the\nestablishment of the perception identity from the outer world merely\nrepresents a detour which has been forced upon the wish-fulfilment by\nexperience.[FS] Thinking is indeed nothing but the equivalent of the\nhallucinatory wish; and if the dream be called a wish-fulfilment this\nbecomes self-evident, as nothing but a wish can impel our psychic\napparatus to activity. The dream, which in fulfilling its wishes follows\nthe short regressive path, thereby preserves for us only an example of\nthe primary form of the psychic apparatus which has been abandoned as\ninexpedient. What once ruled in the waking state when the psychic life\nwas still young and unfit seems to have been banished into the sleeping\nstate, just as we see again in the nursery the bow and arrow, the\ndiscarded primitive weapons of grown-up humanity. _The dream is a\nfragment of the abandoned psychic life of the child._ In the psychoses\nthese modes of operation of the psychic apparatus, which are normally\nsuppressed in the waking state, reassert themselves, and then betray\ntheir inability to satisfy our wants in the outer world.\nThe unconscious wish-feelings evidently strive to assert themselves\nduring the day also, and the fact of transference and the psychoses\nteach us that they endeavour to penetrate to consciousness and dominate\nmotility by the road leading through the system of the foreconscious. It\nis, therefore, the censor lying between the Unc. and the Forec., the\nassumption of which is forced upon us by the dream, that we have to\nrecognise and honour as the guardian of our psychic health. But is it\nnot carelessness on the part of this guardian to diminish its vigilance\nduring the night and to allow the suppressed emotions of the Unc. to\ncome to expression, thus again making possible the hallucinatory\nregression? I think not, for when the critical guardian goes to rest\u2014and\nwe have proof that his slumber is not profound\u2014he takes care to close\nthe gate to motility. No matter what feelings from the otherwise\ninhibited Unc. may roam about on the scene, they need not be interfered\nwith; they remain harmless because they are unable to put in motion the\nmotor apparatus which alone can exert a modifying influence upon the\nouter world. Sleep guarantees the security of the fortress which is\nunder guard. Conditions are less harmless when a displacement of forces\nis produced, not through a nocturnal diminution in the operation of the\ncritical censor, but through pathological enfeeblement of the latter or\nthrough pathological reinforcement of the unconscious excitations, and\nthis while the foreconscious is charged with energy and the avenues to\nmotility are open. The guardian is then overpowered, the unconscious\nexcitations subdue the Forec.; through it they dominate our speech and\nactions, or they enforce the hallucinatory regression, thus governing an\napparatus not designed for them by virtue of the attraction exerted by\nthe perceptions on the distribution of our psychic energy. We call this\ncondition a psychosis.\nWe are now in the best position to complete our psychological\nconstruction, which has been interrupted by the introduction of the two\nsystems, Unc. and Forec. We have still, however, ample reason for giving\nfurther consideration to the wish as the sole psychic motive power in\nthe dream. We have explained that the reason why the dream is in every\ncase a wish realisation is because it is a product of the Unc., which\nknows no other aim in its activity but the fulfilment of wishes, and\nwhich has no other forces at its disposal but wish-feelings. If we avail\nourselves for a moment longer of the right to elaborate from the dream\ninterpretation such far-reaching psychological speculations, we are in\nduty bound to demonstrate that we are thereby bringing the dream into a\nrelationship which may also comprise other psychic structures. If there\nexists a system of the Unc.\u2014or something sufficiently analogous to it\nfor the purpose of our discussion\u2014the dream cannot be its sole\nmanifestation; every dream may be a wish-fulfilment, but there must be\nother forms of abnormal wish-fulfilment besides this of dreams. Indeed,\nthe theory of all psychoneurotic symptoms culminates in the proposition\n_that they too must be taken as wish-fulfilments of the unconscious_.\nOur explanation makes the dream only the first member of a group most\nimportant for the psychiatrist, an understanding of which means the\nsolution of the purely psychological part of the psychiatric problem.\nBut other members of this group of wish-fulfilments, _e.g._, the\nhysterical symptoms, evince one essential quality which I have so far\nfailed to find in the dream. Thus, from the investigations frequently\nreferred to in this treatise, I know that the formation of an hysterical\nsymptom necessitates the combination of both streams of our psychic\nlife. The symptom is not merely the expression of a realised unconscious\nwish, but it must be joined by another wish from the foreconscious which\nis fulfilled by the same symptom; so that the symptom is at least doubly\ndetermined, once by each one of the conflicting systems. Just as in the\ndream, there is no limit to further over-determination. The\ndetermination not derived from the Unc. is, as far as I can see,\ninvariably a stream of thought in reaction against the unconscious wish,\n_e.g._, a self-punishment. Hence I may say, in general, that _an\nhysterical symptom originates only where two contrasting\nwish-fulfilments, having their source in different psychic systems, are\nable to combine in one expression_. (Compare my latest formulation of\nthe origin of the hysterical symptoms in a treatise published by the\n_Zeitschrift f\u00fcr Sexualwissenschaft_, by Hirschfeld and others, 1908).\nExamples on this point would prove of little value, as nothing but a\ncomplete unveiling of the complication in question would carry\nconviction. I therefore content myself with the mere assertion, and will\ncite an example, not for conviction but for explication. The hysterical\nvomiting of a female patient proved, on the one hand, to be the\nrealisation of an unconscious fancy from the time of puberty, that she\nmight be continuously pregnant and have a multitude of children, and\nthis was subsequently united with the wish that she might have them from\nas many men as possible. Against this immoderate wish there arose a\npowerful defensive impulse. But as the vomiting might spoil the\npatient\u2019s figure and beauty, so that she would not find favour in the\neyes of mankind, the symptom was therefore in keeping with her punitive\ntrend of thought, and, being thus admissible from both sides, it was\nallowed to become a reality. This is the same manner of consenting to a\nwish-fulfilment which the queen of the Parthians chose for the triumvir\nCrassus. Believing that he had undertaken the campaign out of greed for\ngold, she caused molten gold to be poured into the throat of the corpse.\n\u201cNow hast thou what thou hast longed for.\u201d As yet we know of the dream\nonly that it expresses a wish-fulfilment of the unconscious; and\napparently the dominating foreconscious permits this only after it has\nsubjected the wish to some distortions. We are really in no position to\ndemonstrate regularly a stream of thought antagonistic to the dream-wish\nwhich is realised in the dream as in its counterpart. Only now and then\nhave we found in the dream traces of reaction formations, as, for\ninstance, the tenderness toward friend R. in the \u201cuncle dream\u201d (p. 116).\nBut the contribution from the foreconscious, which is missing here, may\nbe found in another place. While the dominating system has withdrawn on\nthe wish to sleep, the dream may bring to expression with manifold\ndistortions a wish from the Unc., and realise this wish by producing the\nnecessary changes of energy in the psychic apparatus, and may finally\nretain it through the entire duration of sleep.[FT]\nThis persistent wish to sleep on the part of the foreconscious in\ngeneral facilitates the formation of the dream. Let us refer to the\ndream of the father who, by the gleam of light from the death chamber,\nwas brought to the conclusion that the body has been set on fire. We\nhave shown that one of the psychic forces decisive in causing the father\nto form this conclusion, instead of being awakened by the gleam of\nlight, was the wish to prolong the life of the child seen in the dream\nby one moment. Other wishes proceeding from the repression probably\nescape us, because we are unable to analyse this dream. But as a second\nmotive power of the dream we may mention the father\u2019s desire to sleep,\nfor, like the life of the child, the sleep of the father is prolonged\nfor a moment by the dream. The underlying motive is: \u201cLet the dream go\non, otherwise I must wake up.\u201d As in this dream so also in all other\ndreams, the wish to sleep lends its support to the unconscious wish. On\npage 104 we reported dreams which were apparently dreams of convenience.\nBut, properly speaking, all dreams may claim this designation. The\nefficacy of the wish to continue to sleep is the most easily recognised\nin the waking dreams, which so transform the objective sensory stimulus\nas to render it compatible with the continuance of sleep; they\ninterweave this stimulus with the dream in order to rob it of any claims\nit might make as a warning to the outer world. But this wish to continue\nto sleep must also participate in the formation of all other dreams\nwhich may disturb the sleeping state from within only. \u201cNow, then, sleep\non; why, it\u2019s but a dream\u201d; this is in many cases the suggestion of the\nForec. to consciousness when the dream goes too far; and this also\ndescribes in a general way the attitude of our dominating psychic\nactivity toward dreaming, though the thought remains tacit. I must draw\nthe conclusion that _throughout our entire sleeping state we are just as\ncertain that we are dreaming as we are certain that we are sleeping_. We\nare compelled to disregard the objection urged against this conclusion\nthat our consciousness is never directed to a knowledge of the former,\nand that it is directed to a knowledge of the latter only on special\noccasions when the censor is unexpectedly surprised. Against this\nobjection we may say that there are persons who are entirely conscious\nof their sleeping and dreaming, and who are apparently endowed with the\nconscious faculty of guiding their dream life. Such a dreamer, when\ndissatisfied with the course taken by the dream, breaks it off without\nawakening, and begins it anew in order to continue it with a different\nturn, like the popular author who, on request, gives a happier ending to\nhis play. Or, at another time, if placed by the dream in a sexually\nexciting situation, he thinks in his sleep: \u201cI do not care to continue\nthis dream and exhaust myself by a pollution; I prefer to defer it in\nfavour of a real situation.\u201d\n(_d_) _Waking caused by the Dream\u2014The Function of the Dream\u2014The Anxiety\nDream._\nSince we know that the foreconscious is suspended during the night by\nthe wish to sleep, we can proceed to an intelligent investigation of the\ndream process. But let us first sum up the knowledge of this process\nalready gained. We have shown that the waking activity leaves day\nremnants from which the sum of energy cannot be entirely removed; or the\nwaking activity revives during the day one of the unconscious wishes; or\nboth conditions occur simultaneously; we have already discovered the\nmany variations that may take place. The unconscious wish has already\nmade its way to the day remnants, either during the day or at any rate\nwith the beginning of sleep, and has effected a transference to it. This\nproduces a wish transferred to the recent material, or the suppressed\nrecent wish comes to life again through a reinforcement from the\nunconscious. This wish now endeavours to make its way to consciousness\non the normal path of the mental processes through the foreconscious, to\nwhich indeed it belongs through one of its constituent elements. It is\nconfronted, however, by the censor, which is still active, and to the\ninfluence of which it now succumbs. It now takes on the distortion for\nwhich the way has already been paved by its transference to the recent\nmaterial. Thus far it is in the way of becoming something resembling an\nobsession, delusion, or the like, _i.e._ a thought reinforced by a\ntransference and distorted in expression by the censor. But its further\nprogress is now checked through the dormant state of the foreconscious;\nthis system has apparently protected itself against invasion by\ndiminishing its excitements. The dream process, therefore, takes the\nregressive course, which has just been opened by the peculiarity of the\nsleeping state, and thereby follows the attraction exerted on it by the\nmemory groups, which themselves exist in part only as visual energy not\nyet translated into terms of the later systems. On its way to regression\nthe dream takes on the form of dramatisation. The subject of compression\nwill be discussed later. The dream process has now terminated the second\npart of its repeatedly impeded course. The first part expended itself\nprogressively from the unconscious scenes or phantasies to the\nforeconscious, while the second part gravitates from the advent of the\ncensor back to the perceptions. But when the dream process becomes a\ncontent of perception it has, so to speak, eluded the obstacle set up in\nthe Forec. by the censor and by the sleeping state. It succeeds in\ndrawing attention to itself and in being noticed by consciousness. For\nconsciousness, which means to us a sensory organ for the reception of\npsychic qualities, may receive stimuli from two sources\u2014first, from the\nperiphery of the entire apparatus, viz. from the perception system, and,\nsecondly, from the pleasure and pain stimuli, which constitute the sole\npsychic quality produced in the transformation of energy within the\napparatus. All other processes in the \u03a8-system, even those in the\nforeconscious, are devoid of any psychic quality, and are therefore not\nobjects of consciousness inasmuch as they do not furnish pleasure or\npain for perception. We shall have to assume that those liberations of\npleasure and pain automatically regulate the outlet of the occupation\nprocesses. But in order to make possible more delicate functions, it was\nlater found necessary to render the course of the presentations more\nindependent of the manifestations of pain. To accomplish this the Forec.\nsystem needed some qualities of its own which could attract\nconsciousness, and most probably received them through the connection of\nthe foreconscious processes with the memory system of the signs of\nspeech, which is not devoid of qualities. Through the qualities of this\nsystem, consciousness, which had hitherto been a sensory organ only for\nthe perceptions, now becomes also a sensory organ for a part of our\nmental processes. Thus we have now, as it were, two sensory surfaces,\none directed to perceptions and the other to the foreconscious mental\nprocesses.\nI must assume that the sensory surface of consciousness devoted to the\nForec. is rendered less excitable by sleep than that directed to the\nP-systems. The giving up of interest for the nocturnal mental processes\nis indeed purposeful. Nothing is to disturb the mind; the Forec. wants\nto sleep. But once the dream becomes a perception, it is then capable of\nexciting consciousness through the qualities thus gained. The sensory\nstimulus accomplishes what it was really destined for, namely, it\ndirects a part of the energy at the disposal of the Forec. in the form\nof attention upon the stimulant. We must, therefore, admit that the\ndream invariably awakens us, that is, it puts into activity a part of\nthe dormant force of the Forec. This force imparts to the dream that\ninfluence which we have designated as secondary elaboration for the sake\nof connection and comprehensibility. This means that the dream is\ntreated by it like any other content of perception; it is subjected to\nthe same ideas of expectation, as far at least as the material admits.\nAs far as the direction is concerned in this third part of the dream, it\nmay be said that here again the movement is progressive.\nTo avoid misunderstanding, it will not be amiss to say a few words about\nthe temporal peculiarities of these dream processes. In a very\ninteresting discussion, apparently suggested by Maury\u2019s puzzling\nguillotine dream, Goblot[29] tries to demonstrate that the dream\nrequires no other time than the transition period between sleeping and\nawakening. The awakening requires time, as the dream takes place during\nthat period. One is inclined to believe that the final picture of the\ndream is so strong that it forces the dreamer to awaken; but, as a\nmatter of fact, this picture is strong only because the dreamer is\nalready very near awakening when it appears. \u201cUn r\u00eave c\u2019est un r\u00e9veil\nqui commence.\u201d\nIt has already been emphasized by Dugas[18] that Goblot was forced to\nrepudiate many facts in order to generalise his theory. There are,\nmoreover, dreams from which we do not awaken, _e.g._, some dreams in\nwhich we dream that we dream. From our knowledge of the dream-work, we\ncan by no means admit that it extends only over the period of awakening.\nOn the contrary, we must consider it probable that the first part of the\ndream-work begins during the day when we are still under the domination\nof the foreconscious. The second phase of the dream-work, viz. the\nmodification through the censor, the attraction by the unconscious\nscenes, and the penetration to perception must continue throughout the\nnight. And we are probably always right when we assert that we feel as\nthough we had been dreaming the whole night, although we cannot say\nwhat. I do not, however, think it necessary to assume that, up to the\ntime of becoming conscious, the dream processes really follow the\ntemporal sequence which we have described, viz. that there is first the\ntransferred dream-wish, then the distortion of the censor, and\nconsequently the change of direction to regression, and so on. We were\nforced to form such a succession for the sake of _description_; in\nreality, however, it is much rather a matter of simultaneously trying\nthis path and that, and of emotions fluctuating to and fro, until\nfinally, owing to the most expedient distribution, one particular\ngrouping is secured which remains. From certain personal experiences, I\nam myself inclined to believe that the dream-work often requires more\nthan one day and one night to produce its result; if this be true, the\nextraordinary art manifested in the construction of the dream loses all\nits marvels. In my opinion, even the regard for comprehensibility as an\noccurrence of perception may take effect before the dream attracts\nconsciousness to itself. To be sure, from now on the process is\naccelerated, as the dream is henceforth subjected to the same treatment\nas any other perception. It is like fireworks, which require hours of\npreparation and only a moment for ignition.\nThrough the dream-work the dream process now gains either sufficient\nintensity to attract consciousness to itself and arouse the\nforeconscious, which is quite independent of the time or profundity of\nsleep, or, its intensity being insufficient it must wait until it meets\nthe attention which is set in motion immediately before awakening. Most\ndreams seem to operate with relatively slight psychic intensities, for\nthey wait for the awakening. This, however, explains the fact that we\nregularly perceive something dreamt on being suddenly aroused from a\nsound sleep. Here, as well as in spontaneous awakening, the first glance\nstrikes the perception content created by the dream-work, while the next\nstrikes the one produced from without.\nBut of greater theoretical interest are those dreams which are capable\nof waking us in the midst of sleep. We must bear in mind the expediency\nelsewhere universally demonstrated, and ask ourselves why the dream or\nthe unconscious wish has the power to disturb sleep, _i.e._ the\nfulfilment of the foreconscious wish. This is probably due to certain\nrelations of energy into which we have no insight. If we possessed such\ninsight we should probably find that the freedom given to the dream and\nthe expenditure of a certain amount of detached attention represent for\nthe dream an economy in energy, keeping in view the fact that the\nunconscious must be held in check at night just as during the day. We\nknow from experience that the dream, even if it interrupts sleep,\nrepeatedly during the same night, still remains compatible with sleep.\nWe wake up for an instant, and immediately resume our sleep. It is like\ndriving off a fly during sleep, we awake _ad hoc_, and when we resume\nour sleep we have removed the disturbance. As demonstrated by familiar\nexamples from the sleep of wet nurses, &c., the fulfilment of the wish\nto sleep is quite compatible with the retention of a certain amount of\nattention in a given direction.\nBut we must here take cognisance of an objection that is based on a\nbetter knowledge of the unconscious processes. Although we have\nourselves described the unconscious wishes as always active, we have,\nnevertheless, asserted that they are not sufficiently strong during the\nday to make themselves perceptible. But when we sleep, and the\nunconscious wish has shown its power to form a dream, and with it to\nawaken the foreconscious, why, then, does this power become exhausted\nafter the dream has been taken cognisance of? Would it not seem more\nprobable that the dream should continually renew itself, like the\ntroublesome fly which, when driven away, takes pleasure in returning\nagain and again? What justifies our assertion that the dream removes the\ndisturbance of sleep?\nThat the unconscious wishes always remain active is quite true. They\nrepresent paths which are passable whenever a sum of excitement makes\nuse of them. Moreover, a remarkable peculiarity of the unconscious\nprocesses is the fact that they remain indestructible. Nothing can be\nbrought to an end in the unconscious; nothing can cease or be forgotten.\nThis impression is most strongly gained in the study of the neuroses,\nespecially of hysteria. The unconscious stream of thought which leads to\nthe discharge through an attack becomes passable again as soon as there\nis an accumulation of a sufficient amount of excitement. The\nmortification brought on thirty years ago, after having gained access to\nthe unconscious affective source, operates during all these thirty years\nlike a recent one. Whenever its memory is touched, it is revived and\nshows itself to be supplied with the excitement which is discharged in a\nmotor attack. It is just here that the office of psychotherapy begins,\nits task being to bring about adjustment and forgetfulness for the\nunconscious processes. Indeed, the fading of memories and the flagging\nof affects, which we are apt to take as self-evident and to explain as a\nprimary influence of time on the psychic memories, are in reality\nsecondary changes brought about by painstaking work. It is the\nforeconscious that accomplishes this work; and the only course to be\npursued by psychotherapy is to subjugate the Unc. to the domination of\nthe Forec.\nThere are, therefore, two exits for the individual unconscious emotional\nprocess. It is either left to itself, in which case it ultimately breaks\nthrough somewhere and secures for once a discharge for its excitation\ninto motility; or it succumbs to the influence of the foreconscious, and\nits excitation becomes confined through this influence instead of being\ndischarged. It is the latter process that occurs in the dream. Owing to\nthe fact that it is directed by the conscious excitement, the energy\nfrom the Forec., which confronts the dream when grown to perception,\nrestricts the unconscious excitement of the dream and renders it\nharmless as a disturbing factor. When the dreamer wakes up for a moment,\nhe has actually chased away the fly that has threatened to disturb his\nsleep. We can now understand that it is really more expedient and\neconomical to give full sway to the unconscious wish, and clear its way\nto regression so that it may form a dream, and then restrict and adjust\nthis dream by means of a small expenditure of foreconscious labour, than\nto curb the unconscious throughout the entire period of sleep. We\nshould, indeed, expect that the dream, even if it was not originally an\nexpedient process, would have acquired some function in the play of\nforces of the psychic life. We now see what this function is. The dream\nhas taken it upon itself to bring the liberated excitement of the Unc.\nback under the domination of the foreconscious; it thus affords relief\nfor the excitement of the Unc. and acts as a safety-valve for the\nlatter, and at the same time it insures the sleep of the foreconscious\nat a slight expenditure of the waking state. Like the other psychic\nformations of its group, the dream offers itself as a compromise serving\nsimultaneously both systems by fulfilling both wishes in so far as they\nare compatible with each other. A glance at Robert\u2019s \u201celimination\ntheory,\u201d referred to on page 66, will show that we must agree with this\nauthor in his main point, viz. in the determination of the function of\nthe dream, though we differ from him in our hypotheses and in our\ntreatment of the dream process.\nThe above qualification\u2014in so far as the two wishes are compatible with\neach other\u2014contains a suggestion that there may be cases in which the\nfunction of the dream suffers shipwreck. The dream process is in the\nfirst instance admitted as a wish-fulfilment of the unconscious, but if\nthis tentative wish-fulfilment disturbs the foreconscious to such an\nextent that the latter can no longer maintain its rest, the dream then\nbreaks the compromise and fails to perform the second part of its task.\nIt is then at once broken off, and replaced by complete wakefulness.\nHere, too, it is not really the fault of the dream, if, while ordinarily\nthe guardian of sleep, it is here compelled to appear as the disturber\nof sleep, nor should this cause us to entertain any doubts as to its\nefficacy. This is not the only case in the organism in which an\notherwise efficacious arrangement became inefficacious and disturbing as\nsoon as some element is changed in the conditions of its origin; the\ndisturbance then serves at least the new purpose of announcing the\nchange, and calling into play against it the means of adjustment of the\norganism. In this connection, I naturally bear in mind the case of the\nanxiety dream, and in order not to have the appearance of trying to\nexclude this testimony against the theory of wish-fulfilment wherever I\nencounter it, I will attempt an explanation of the anxiety dream, at\nleast offering some suggestions.\nThat a psychic process developing anxiety may still be a wish-fulfilment\nhas long ceased to impress us as a contradiction. We may explain this\noccurrence by the fact that the wish belongs to one system (the Unc.),\nwhile by the other system (the Forec.), this wish has been rejected and\nsuppressed. The subjection of the Unc. by the Forec. is not complete\neven in perfect psychic health; the amount of this suppression shows the\ndegree of our psychic normality. Neurotic symptoms show that there is a\nconflict between the two systems; the symptoms are the results of a\ncompromise of this conflict, and they temporarily put an end to it. On\nthe one hand, they afford the Unc. an outlet for the discharge of its\nexcitement, and serve it as a sally port, while, on the other hand, they\ngive the Forec. the capability of dominating the Unc. to some extent. It\nis highly instructive to consider, _e.g._, the significance of any\nhysterical phobia or of an agoraphobia. Suppose a neurotic incapable of\ncrossing the street alone, which we would justly call a \u201csymptom.\u201d We\nattempt to remove this symptom by urging him to the action which he\ndeems himself incapable of. The result will be an attack of anxiety,\njust as an attack of anxiety in the street has often been the cause of\nestablishing an agoraphobia. We thus learn that the symptom has been\nconstituted in order to guard against the outbreak of the anxiety. The\nphobia is thrown before the anxiety like a fortress on the frontier.\nUnless we enter into the part played by the affects in these processes,\nwhich can be done here only imperfectly, we cannot continue our\ndiscussion. Let us therefore advance the proposition that the reason why\nthe suppression of the unconscious becomes absolutely necessary is\nbecause, if the discharge of presentation should be left to itself, it\nwould develop an affect in the Unc. which originally bore the character\nof pleasure, but which, since the appearance of the repression, bears\nthe character of pain. The aim, as well as the result, of the\nsuppression is to stop the development of this pain. The suppression\nextends over the unconscious ideation, because the liberation of pain\nmight emanate from the ideation. The foundation is here laid for a very\ndefinite assumption concerning the nature of the affective development.\nIt is regarded as a motor or secondary activity, the key to the\ninnervation of which is located in the presentations of the Unc. Through\nthe domination of the Forec. these presentations become, as it were,\nthrottled and inhibited at the exit of the emotion-developing impulses.\nThe danger, which is due to the fact that the Forec. ceases to occupy\nthe energy, therefore consists in the fact that the unconscious\nexcitations liberate such an affect as\u2014in consequence of the repression\nthat has previously taken place\u2014can only be perceived as pain or\nanxiety.\nThis danger is released through the full sway of the dream process. The\ndeterminations for its realisation consist in the fact that repressions\nhave taken place, and that the suppressed emotional wishes shall become\nsufficiently strong. They thus stand entirely without the psychological\nrealm of the dream structure. Were it not for the fact that our subject\nis connected through just one factor, namely, the freeing of the Unc.\nduring sleep, with the subject of the development of anxiety, I could\ndispense with discussion of the anxiety dream, and thus avoid all\nobscurities connected with it.\nAs I have often repeated, the theory of the anxiety belongs to the\npsychology of the neuroses. I would say that the anxiety in the dream is\nan anxiety problem and not a dream problem. We have nothing further to\ndo with it after having once demonstrated its point of contact with the\nsubject of the dream process. There is only one thing left for me to do.\nAs I have asserted that the neurotic anxiety originates from sexual\nsources, I can subject anxiety dreams to analysis in order to\ndemonstrate the sexual material in their dream thoughts.\nFor good reasons I refrain from citing here any of the numerous examples\nplaced at my disposal by neurotic patients, but prefer to give anxiety\ndreams from young persons.\nPersonally, I have had no real anxiety dream for decades, but I recall\none from my seventh or eighth year which I subjected to interpretation\nabout thirty years later. The dream was very vivid, and showed me _my\nbeloved mother, with peculiarly calm sleeping countenance, carried into\nthe room and laid on the bed by two (or three) persons with bird\u2019s\nbeaks_. I awoke crying and screaming, and disturbed my parents. The very\ntall figures\u2014draped in a peculiar manner\u2014with beaks, I had taken from\nthe illustrations of Philippson\u2019s bible; I believe they represented\ndeities with heads of sparrowhawks from an Egyptian tomb relief. The\nanalysis also introduced the reminiscence of a naughty janitor\u2019s boy,\nwho used to play with us children on the meadow in front of the house; I\nwould add that his name was Philip. I feel that I first heard from this\nboy the vulgar word signifying sexual intercourse, which is replaced\namong the educated by the Latin \u201ccoitus,\u201d but to which the dream\ndistinctly alludes by the selection of the bird\u2019s heads.[FU] I must have\nsuspected the sexual significance of the word from the facial expression\nof my worldly-wise teacher. My mother\u2019s features in the dream were\ncopied from the countenance of my grandfather, whom I had seen a few\ndays before his death snoring in the state of coma. The interpretation\nof the secondary elaboration in the dream must therefore have been that\nmy mother was dying; the tomb relief, too, agrees with this. In this\nanxiety I awoke, and could not calm myself until I had awakened my\nparents. I remember that I suddenly became calm on coming face to face\nwith my mother, as if I needed the assurance that my mother was not\ndead. But this secondary interpretation of the dream had been effected\nonly under the influence of the developed anxiety. I was not frightened\nbecause I dreamed that my mother was dying, but I interpreted the dream\nin this manner in the foreconscious elaboration because I was already\nunder the domination of the anxiety. The latter, however, could be\ntraced by means of the repression to an obscure obviously sexual desire,\nwhich had found its satisfying expression in the visual content of the\ndream.\nA man twenty-seven years old who had been severely ill for a year had\nhad many terrifying dreams between the ages of eleven and thirteen. He\nthought that a man with an axe was running after him; he wished to run,\nbut felt paralysed and could not move from the spot. This may be taken\nas a good example of a very common, and apparently sexually indifferent,\nanxiety dream. In the analysis the dreamer first thought of a story told\nhim by his uncle, which chronologically was later than the dream, viz.\nthat he was attacked at night by a suspicious-looking individual. This\noccurrence led him to believe that he himself might have already heard\nof a similar episode at the time of the dream. In connection with the\naxe he recalled that during that period of his life he once hurt his\nhand with an axe while chopping wood. This immediately led to his\nrelations with his younger brother, whom he used to maltreat and knock\ndown. In particular, he recalled an occasion when he struck his brother\non the head with his boot until he bled, whereupon his mother remarked:\n\u201cI fear he will kill him some day.\u201d While he was seemingly thinking of\nthe subject of violence, a reminiscence from his ninth year suddenly\noccurred to him. His parents came home late and went to bed while he was\nfeigning sleep. He soon heard panting and other noises that appeared\nstrange to him, and he could also make out the position of his parents\nin bed. His further associations showed that he had established an\nanalogy between this relation between his parents and his own relation\ntoward his younger brother. He subsumed what occurred between his\nparents under the conception \u201cviolence and wrestling,\u201d and thus reached\na sadistic conception of the coitus act, as often happens among\nchildren. The fact that he often noticed blood on his mother\u2019s bed\ncorroborated his conception.\nThat the sexual intercourse of adults appears strange to children who\nobserve it, and arouses fear in them, I dare say is a fact of daily\nexperience. I have explained this fear by the fact that sexual\nexcitement is not mastered by their understanding, and is probably also\ninacceptable to them because their parents are involved in it. For the\nsame reason this excitement is converted into fear. At a still earlier\nperiod of life sexual emotion directed toward the parent of opposite sex\ndoes not meet with repression but finds free expression, as we have seen\nabove (pp. 209\u2013215).\nFor the night terrors with hallucinations (_pavor nocturnus_) frequently\nfound in children, I would unhesitatingly give the same explanation.\nHere, too, we are certainly dealing with the incomprehensible and\nrejected sexual feelings, which, if noted, would probably show a\ntemporal periodicity, for an enhancement of the sexual _libido_ may just\nas well be produced accidentally through emotional impressions as\nthrough the spontaneous and gradual processes of development.\nI lack the necessary material to sustain these explanations from\nobservation. On the other hand, the pediatrists seem to lack the point\nof view which alone makes comprehensible the whole series of phenomena,\non the somatic as well as on the psychic side. To illustrate by a\ncomical example how one wearing the blinders of medical mythology may\nmiss the understanding of such cases, I will relate a case which I found\nin a thesis on _pavor nocturnus_ by _Debacker_,[17] 1881 (p. 66). A\nthirteen-year-old boy of delicate health began to become anxious and\ndreamy; his sleep became restless, and about once a week it was\ninterrupted by an acute attack of anxiety with hallucinations. The\nmemory of these dreams was invariably very distinct. Thus, he related\nthat the _devil_ shouted at him: \u201cNow we have you, now we have you,\u201d and\nthis was followed by an odour of sulphur; the fire burned his skin. This\ndream aroused him, terror-stricken. He was unable to scream at first;\nthen his voice returned, and he was heard to say distinctly: \u201cNo, no,\nnot me; why, I have done nothing,\u201d or, \u201cPlease don\u2019t, I shall never do\nit again.\u201d Occasionally, also, he said: \u201cAlbert has not done that.\u201d\nLater he avoided undressing, because, as he said, the fire attacked him\nonly when he was undressed. From amid these evil dreams, which menaced\nhis health, he was sent into the country, where he recovered within a\nyear and a half, but at the age of fifteen he once confessed: \u201cJe\nn\u2019osais pas l\u2019avouer, mais j\u2019\u00e9prouvais continuellement des picotements\net des surexcitations aux _parties_;[FV] \u00e0 la fin, cela m\u2019\u00e9nervait tant\nque plusieurs fois, j\u2019ai pens\u00e9 me jeter par la fen\u00eatre au dortoir.\u201d\nIt is certainly not difficult to suspect: 1, that the boy had practised\nmasturbation in former years, that he probably denied it, and was\nthreatened with severe punishment for his wrongdoing (his confession: Je\nne le ferai plus; his denial: Albert n\u2019a jamais fait \u00e7a). 2, That under\nthe pressure of puberty the temptation to self-abuse through the\ntickling of the genitals was reawakened. 3, That now, however, a\nstruggle of repression arose in him, suppressing the _libido_ and\nchanging it into fear, which subsequently took the form of the\npunishments with which he was then threatened.\nLet us, however, quote the conclusions drawn by our author (p. 69). This\nobservation shows: 1, That the influence of puberty may produce in a boy\nof delicate health a condition of extreme weakness, and that it may lead\nto a _very marked cerebral an\u00e6mia_.[FW]\n2. This cerebral an\u00e6mia produces a transformation of character,\ndemonomaniacal hallucinations, and very violent nocturnal, perhaps also\ndiurnal, states of anxiety.\n3. Demonomania and the self-reproaches of the day can be traced to the\ninfluences of religious education which the subject underwent as a\nchild.\n4. All manifestations disappeared as a result of a lengthy sojourn in\nthe country, bodily exercise, and the return of physical strength after\nthe termination of the period of puberty.\n5. A predisposing influence for the origin of the cerebral condition of\nthe boy may be attributed to heredity and to the father\u2019s chronic\nsyphilitic state.\nThe concluding remarks of the author read: \u201cNous avons fait entrer cette\nobservation dans le cadre des d\u00e9lires apyr\u00e9tiques d\u2019inanition, car c\u2019est\n\u00e0 l\u2019isch\u00e9mie c\u00e9r\u00e9brale que nous rattachons cet \u00e9tat particulier.\u201d\n(_e_) _The Primary and Secondary Processes\u2014Regression._\nIn venturing to attempt to penetrate more deeply into the psychology of\nthe dream processes, I have undertaken a difficult task, to which,\nindeed, my power of description is hardly equal. To reproduce in\ndescription by a succession of words the simultaneousness of so complex\na chain of events, and in doing so to appear unbiassed throughout the\nexposition, goes fairly beyond my powers. I have now to atone for the\nfact that I have been unable in my description of the dream psychology\nto follow the historic development of my views. The view-points for my\nconception of the dream were reached through earlier investigations in\nthe psychology of the neuroses, to which I am not supposed to refer\nhere, but to which I am repeatedly forced to refer, whereas I should\nprefer to proceed in the opposite direction, and, starting from the\ndream, to establish a connection with the psychology of the neuroses. I\nam well aware of all the inconveniences arising for the reader from this\ndifficulty, but I know of no way to avoid them.\nAs I am dissatisfied with this state of affairs, I am glad to dwell upon\nanother viewpoint which seems to raise the value of my efforts. As has\nbeen shown in the introduction to the first chapter, I found myself\nconfronted with a theme which had been marked by the sharpest\ncontradictions on the part of the authorities. After our elaboration of\nthe dream problems we found room for most of these contradictions. We\nhave been forced, however, to take decided exception to two of the views\npronounced, viz. that the dream is a senseless and that it is a somatic\nprocess; apart from these cases we have had to accept all the\ncontradictory views in one place or another of the complicated argument,\nand we have been able to demonstrate that they had discovered something\nthat was correct. That the dream continues the impulses and interests of\nthe waking state has been quite generally confirmed through the\ndiscovery of the latent thoughts of the dream. These thoughts concern\nthemselves only with things that seem important and of momentous\ninterest to us. The dream never occupies itself with trifles. But we\nhave also concurred with the contrary view, viz. that the dream gathers\nup the indifferent remnants from the day, and that not until it has in\nsome measure withdrawn itself from the waking activity can an important\nevent of the day be taken up by the dream. We found this holding true\nfor the dream content, which gives the dream thought its changed\nexpression by means of disfigurement. We have said that from the nature\nof the association mechanism the dream process more easily takes\npossession of recent or indifferent material which has not yet been\nseized by the waking mental activity; and by reason of the censor it\ntransfers the psychic intensity from the important but also disagreeable\nto the indifferent material. The hypermnesia of the dream and the resort\nto infantile material have become main supports in our theory. In our\ntheory of the dream we have attributed to the wish originating from the\ninfantile the part of an indispensable motor for the formation of the\ndream. We naturally could not think of doubting the experimentally\ndemonstrated significance of the objective sensory stimuli during sleep;\nbut we have brought this material into the same relation to the\ndream-wish as the thought remnants from the waking activity. There was\nno need of disputing the fact that the dream interprets the objective\nsensory stimuli after the manner of an illusion; but we have supplied\nthe motive for this interpretation which has been left undecided by the\nauthorities. The interpretation follows in such a manner that the\nperceived object is rendered harmless as a sleep disturber and becomes\navailable for the wish-fulfilment. Though we do not admit as special\nsources of the dream the subjective state of excitement of the sensory\norgans during sleep, which seems to have been demonstrated by Trumbull\nLadd,[40] we are nevertheless able to explain this excitement through\nthe regressive revival of active memories behind the dream. A modest\npart in our conception has also been assigned to the inner organic\nsensations which are wont to be taken as the cardinal point in the\nexplanation of the dream. These\u2014the sensation of falling, flying, or\ninhibition\u2014stand as an ever ready material to be used by the dream-work\nto express the dream thought as often as need arises.\nThat the dream process is a rapid and momentary one seems to be true for\nthe perception through consciousness of the already prepared dream\ncontent; the preceding parts of the dream process probably take a slow,\nfluctuating course. We have solved the riddle of the superabundant dream\ncontent compressed within the briefest moment by explaining that this is\ndue to the appropriation of almost fully formed structures from the\npsychic life. That the dream is disfigured and distorted by memory we\nfound to be correct, but not troublesome, as this is only the last\nmanifest operation in the work of disfigurement which has been active\nfrom the beginning of the dream-work. In the bitter and seemingly\nirreconcilable controversy as to whether the psychic life sleeps at\nnight or can make the same use of all its capabilities as during the\nday, we have been able to agree with both sides, though not fully with\neither. We have found proof that the dream thoughts represent a most\ncomplicated intellectual activity, employing almost every means\nfurnished by the psychic apparatus; still it cannot be denied that these\ndream thoughts have originated during the day, and it is indispensable\nto assume that there is a sleeping state of the psychic life. Thus, even\nthe theory of partial sleep has come into play; but the characteristics\nof the sleeping state have been found not in the dilapidation of the\npsychic connections but in the cessation of the psychic system\ndominating the day, arising from its desire to sleep. The withdrawal\nfrom the outer world retains its significance also for our conception;\nthough not the only factor, it nevertheless helps the regression to make\npossible the representation of the dream. That we should reject the\nvoluntary guidance of the presentation course is uncontestable; but the\npsychic life does not thereby become aimless, for we have seen that\nafter the abandonment of the desired end-presentation undesired ones\ngain the mastery. The loose associative connection in the dream we have\nnot only recognised, but we have placed under its control a far greater\nterritory than could have been supposed; we have, however, found it\nmerely the feigned substitute for another correct and senseful one. To\nbe sure we, too, have called the dream absurd; but we have been able to\nlearn from examples how wise the dream really is when it simulates\nabsurdity. We do not deny any of the functions that have been attributed\nto the dream. That the dream relieves the mind like a valve, and that,\naccording to Robert\u2019s assertion, all kinds of harmful material are\nrendered harmless through representation in the dream, not only exactly\ncoincides with our theory of the two-fold wish-fulfilment in the dream,\nbut, in his own wording, becomes even more comprehensible for us than\nfor Robert himself. The free indulgence of the psychic in the play of\nits faculties finds expression with us in the non-interference with the\ndream on the part of the foreconscious activity. The \u201creturn to the\nembryonal state of psychic life in the dream\u201d and the observation of\nHavelock Ellis,[23] \u201can archaic world of vast emotions and imperfect\nthoughts,\u201d appear to us as happy anticipations of our deductions to the\neffect that _primitive_ modes of work suppressed during the day\nparticipate in the formation of the dream; and with us, as with\nDelage,[15] the _suppressed_ material becomes the mainspring of the\ndreaming.\nWe have fully recognised the r\u00f4le which Scherner ascribes to the dream\nphantasy, and even his interpretation; but we have been obliged, so to\nspeak, to conduct them to another department in the problem. It is not\nthe dream that produces the phantasy but the unconscious phantasy that\ntakes the greatest part in the formation of the dream thoughts. We are\nindebted to Scherner for his clue to the source of the dream thoughts,\nbut almost everything that he ascribes to the dream-work is attributable\nto the activity of the unconscious, which is at work during the day, and\nwhich supplies incitements not only for dreams but for neurotic symptoms\nas well. We have had to separate the dream-work from this activity as\nbeing something entirely different and far more restricted. Finally, we\nhave by no means abandoned the relation of the dream to mental\ndisturbances, but, on the contrary, we have given it a more solid\nfoundation on new ground.\nThus held together by the new material of our theory as by a superior\nunity, we find the most varied and most contradictory conclusions of the\nauthorities fitting into our structure; some of them are differently\ndisposed, only a few of them are entirely rejected. But our own\nstructure is still unfinished. For, disregarding the many obscurities\nwhich we have necessarily encountered in our advance into the darkness\nof psychology, we are now apparently embarrassed by a new contradiction.\nOn the one hand, we have allowed the dream thoughts to proceed from\nperfectly normal mental operations, while, on the other hand, we have\nfound among the dream thoughts a number of entirely abnormal mental\nprocesses which extend likewise to the dream contents. These,\nconsequently, we have repeated in the interpretation of the dream. All\nthat we have termed the \u201cdream-work\u201d seems so remote from the psychic\nprocesses recognised by us as correct, that the severest judgments of\nthe authors as to the low psychic activity of dreaming seem to us well\nfounded.\nPerhaps only through still further advance can enlightenment and\nimprovement be brought about. I shall pick out one of the constellations\nleading to the formation of dreams.\nWe have learned that the dream replaces a number of thoughts derived\nfrom daily life which are perfectly formed logically. We cannot\ntherefore doubt that these thoughts originate from our normal mental\nlife. All the qualities which we esteem in our mental operations, and\nwhich distinguish these as complicated activities of a high order, we\nfind repeated in the dream thoughts. There is, however, no need of\nassuming that this mental work is performed during sleep, as this would\nmaterially impair the conception of the psychic state of sleep we have\nhitherto adhered to. These thoughts may just as well have originated\nfrom the day, and, unnoticed by our consciousness from their inception,\nthey may have continued to develop until they stood complete at the\nonset of sleep. If we are to conclude anything from this state of\naffairs, it will at most prove _that the most complex mental operations\nare possible without the co-operation of consciousness_, which we have\nalready learned independently from every psychoanalysis of persons\nsuffering from hysteria or obsessions. These dream thoughts are in\nthemselves surely not incapable of consciousness; if they have not\nbecome conscious to us during the day, this may have various reasons.\nThe state of becoming conscious depends on the exercise of a certain\npsychic function, viz. attention, which seems to be extended only in a\ndefinite quantity, and which may have been withdrawn from the stream of\nthought in question by other aims. Another way in which such mental\nstreams are kept from consciousness is the following:\u2014Our conscious\nreflection teaches us that when exercising attention we pursue a\ndefinite course. But if that course leads us to an idea which does not\nhold its own with the critic, we discontinue and cease to apply our\nattention. Now, apparently, the stream of thought thus started and\nabandoned may spin on without regaining attention unless it reaches a\nspot of especially marked intensity which forces the return of\nattention. An initial rejection, perhaps consciously brought about by\nthe judgment on the ground of incorrectness or unfitness for the actual\npurpose of the mental act, may therefore account for the fact that a\nmental process continues until the onset of sleep unnoticed by\nconsciousness.\nLet us recapitulate by saying that we call such a stream of thought a\nforeconscious one, that we believe it to be perfectly correct, and that\nit may just as well be a more neglected one or an interrupted and\nsuppressed one. Let us also state frankly in what manner we conceive\nthis presentation course. We believe that a certain sum of excitement,\nwhich we call occupation energy, is displaced from an end-presentation\nalong the association paths selected by that end-presentation. A\n\u201cneglected\u201d stream of thought has received no such occupation, and from\na \u201csuppressed\u201d or \u201crejected\u201d one this occupation has been withdrawn;\nboth have thus been left to their own emotions. The end-stream of\nthought stocked with energy is under certain conditions able to draw to\nitself the attention of consciousness, through which means it then\nreceives a \u201csurplus of energy.\u201d We shall be obliged somewhat later to\nelucidate our assumption concerning the nature and activity of\nconsciousness.\nA train of thought thus incited in the Forec. may either disappear\nspontaneously or continue. The former issue we conceive as follows: It\ndiffuses its energy through all the association paths emanating from it,\nand throws the entire chain of ideas into a state of excitement which,\nafter lasting for a while, subsides through the transformation of the\nexcitement requiring an outlet into dormant energy.[FX] If this first\nissue is brought about the process has no further significance for the\ndream formation. But other end-presentations are lurking in our\nforeconscious that originate from the sources of our unconscious and\nfrom the ever active wishes. These may take possession of the\nexcitations in the circle of thought thus left to itself, establish a\nconnection between it and the unconscious wish, and transfer to it the\nenergy inherent in the unconscious wish. Henceforth the neglected or\nsuppressed train of thought is in a position to maintain itself,\nalthough this reinforcement does not help it to gain access to\nconsciousness. We may say that the hitherto foreconscious train of\nthought has been drawn into the unconscious.\nOther constellations for the dream formation would result if the\nforeconscious train of thought had from the beginning been connected\nwith the unconscious wish, and for that reason met with rejection by the\ndominating end-occupation; or if an unconscious wish were made active\nfor other\u2014possibly somatic\u2014reasons and of its own accord sought a\ntransference to the psychic remnants not occupied by the Forec. All\nthree cases finally combine in one issue, so that there is established\nin the foreconscious a stream of thought which, having been abandoned by\nthe foreconscious occupation, receives occupation from the unconscious\nwish.\nThe stream of thought is henceforth subjected to a series of\ntransformations which we no longer recognise as normal psychic processes\nand which give us a surprising result, viz. a psychopathological\nformation. Let us emphasize and group the same.\n1. The intensities of the individual ideas become capable of discharge\nin their entirety, and, proceeding from one conception to the other,\nthey thus form single presentations endowed with marked intensity.\nThrough the repeated recurrence of this process the intensity of an\nentire train of ideas may ultimately be gathered in a single\npresentation element. This is the principle of _compression or\ncondensation_ with which we became acquainted in the chapter on \u201cThe\nDream-Work.\u201d It is condensation that is mainly responsible for the\nstrange impression of the dream, for we know of nothing analogous to it\nin the normal psychic life accessible to consciousness. We find here,\nalso, presentations which possess great psychic significance as\njunctions or as end-results of whole chains of thought; but this\nvalidity does not manifest itself in any character conspicuous enough\nfor internal perception; hence, what has been presented in it does not\nbecome in any way more intensive. In the process of condensation the\nentire psychic connection becomes transformed into the intensity of the\npresentation content. It is the same as in a book where we space or\nprint in heavy type any word upon which particular stress is laid for\nthe understanding of the text. In speech the same word would be\npronounced loudly and deliberately and with emphasis. The first\ncomparison leads us at once to an example taken from the chapter on \u201cThe\nDream-Work\u201d (trimethylamine in the dream of Irma\u2019s injection).\nHistorians of art call our attention to the fact that the most ancient\nhistorical sculptures follow a similar principle in expressing the rank\nof the persons represented by the size of the statue. The king is made\ntwo or three times as large as his retinue or the vanquished enemy. A\npiece of art, however, from the Roman period makes use of more subtle\nmeans to accomplish the same purpose. The figure of the emperor is\nplaced in the centre in a firmly erect posture; special care is bestowed\non the proper modelling of his figure; his enemies are seen cowering at\nhis feet; but he is no longer represented a giant among dwarfs. However,\nthe bowing of the subordinate to his superior in our own days is only an\necho of that ancient principle of representation.\nThe direction taken by the condensations of the dream is prescribed on\nthe one hand by the true foreconscious relations of the dream thoughts,\non the other hand by the attraction of the visual reminiscences in the\nunconscious. The success of the condensation work produces those\nintensities which are required for penetration into the perception\nsystems.\n2. Through this free transferability of the intensities,\nmoreover, and in the service of condensation, _intermediary\npresentations_\u2014compromises, as it were\u2014are formed (_cf._ the numerous\nexamples). This, likewise, is something unheard of in the normal\npresentation course, where it is above all a question of selection and\nretention of the \u201cproper\u201d presentation element. On the other hand,\ncomposite and compromise formations occur with extraordinary frequency\nwhen we are trying to find the linguistic expression for foreconscious\nthoughts; these are considered \u201cslips of the tongue.\u201d\n3. The presentations which transfer their intensities to one another are\n_very loosely connected_, and are joined together by such forms of\nassociation as are spurned in our serious thought and are utilised in\nthe production of the effect of wit only. Among these we particularly\nfind associations of the sound and consonance types.\n4. Contradictory thoughts do not strive to eliminate one another, but\nremain side by side. They often unite to produce condensation _as if no\ncontradiction_ existed, or they form compromises for which we should\nnever forgive our thoughts, but which we frequently approve of in our\nactions.\nThese are some of the most conspicuous abnormal processes to which the\nthoughts which have previously been rationally formed are subjected in\nthe course of the dream-work. As the main feature of these processes we\nrecognise the high importance attached to the fact of rendering the\noccupation energy mobile and capable of discharge; the content and the\nactual significance of the psychic elements, to which these energies\nadhere, become a matter of secondary importance. One might possibly\nthink that the condensation and compromise formation is effected only in\nthe service of regression, when occasion arises for changing thoughts\ninto pictures. But the analysis and\u2014still more distinctly\u2014the synthesis\nof dreams which lack regression toward pictures, _e.g._ the dream\n\u201cAutodidasker\u2014Conversation with Court-Councillor N.,\u201d present the same\nprocesses of displacement and condensation as the others.\nHence we cannot refuse to acknowledge that the two kinds of essentially\ndifferent psychic processes participate in the formation of the dream;\none forms perfectly correct dream thoughts which are equivalent to\nnormal thoughts, while the other treats these ideas in a highly\nsurprising and incorrect manner. The latter process we have already set\napart in Chapter VI as the dream-work proper. What have we now to\nadvance concerning this latter psychic process?\nWe should be unable to answer this question here if we had not\npenetrated considerably into the psychology of the neuroses and\nespecially of hysteria. From this we learn that the same\nincorrect psychic processes\u2014as well as others that have not been\nenumerated\u2014control the formation of hysterical symptoms. In hysteria,\ntoo, we at once find a series of perfectly correct thoughts equivalent\nto our conscious thoughts, of whose existence, however, in this form we\ncan learn nothing and which we can only subsequently reconstruct. If\nthey have forced their way anywhere to our perception, we discover from\nthe analysis of the symptom formed that these normal thoughts have been\nsubjected to abnormal treatment and _have been transformed into the\nsymptom by means of condensation and compromise formation, through\nsuperficial associations, under cover of contradictions, and eventually\nover the road of regression_. In view of the complete identity found\nbetween the peculiarities of the dream-work and of the psychic activity\nforming the psychoneurotic symptoms, we shall feel justified in\ntransferring to the dream the conclusions urged upon us by hysteria.\nFrom the theory of hysteria we borrow the proposition that _such an\nabnormal psychic elaboration of a normal train of thought takes place\nonly when the latter has been used for the transference of an\nunconscious wish which dates from the infantile life and is in a state\nof repression_. In accordance with this proposition we have construed\nthe theory of the dream on the assumption that the actuating dream-wish\ninvariably originates in the unconscious, which, as we ourselves have\nadmitted, cannot be universally demonstrated though it cannot be\nrefuted. But in order to explain the real meaning of the term\n_repression_, which we have employed so freely, we shall be obliged to\nmake some further addition to our psychological construction.\nWe have above elaborated the fiction of a primitive psychic apparatus,\nwhose work is regulated by the efforts to avoid accumulation of\nexcitement and as far as possible to maintain itself free from\nexcitement. For this reason it was constructed after the plan of a\nreflex apparatus; the motility, originally the path for the inner bodily\nchange, formed a discharging path standing at its disposal. We\nsubsequently discussed the psychic results of a feeling of\ngratification, and we might at the same time have introduced the second\nassumption, viz. that accumulation of excitement\u2014following certain\nmodalities that do not concern us\u2014is perceived as pain and sets the\napparatus in motion in order to reproduce a feeling of gratification in\nwhich the diminution of the excitement is perceived as pleasure. Such a\ncurrent in the apparatus which emanates from pain and strives for\npleasure we call a wish. We have said that nothing but a wish is capable\nof setting the apparatus in motion, and that the discharge of excitement\nin the apparatus is regulated automatically by the perception of\npleasure and pain. The first wish must have been an hallucinatory\noccupation of the memory for gratification. But this hallucination,\nunless it were maintained to the point of exhaustion, proved incapable\nof bringing about a cessation of the desire and consequently of securing\nthe pleasure connected with gratification.\nThus there was required a second activity\u2014in our terminology the\nactivity of a second system\u2014which should not permit the memory\noccupation to advance to perception and therefrom to restrict the\npsychic forces, but should lead the excitement emanating from the\ncraving stimulus by a devious path over the spontaneous motility which\nultimately should so change the outer world as to allow the real\nperception of the object of gratification to take place. Thus far we\nhave elaborated the plan of the psychic apparatus; these two systems are\nthe germ of the Unc. and Forec. which we include in the fully developed\napparatus.\nIn order to be in a position successfully to change the outer world\nthrough the motility, there is required the accumulation of a large sum\nof experiences in the memory systems as well as a manifold fixation of\nthe relations which are evoked in this memory material by different\nend-presentations. We now proceed further with our assumption. The\nmanifold activity of the second system, tentatively sending forth and\nretracting energy, must on the one hand have full command over all\nmemory material, but on the other hand it would be a superfluous\nexpenditure for it to send to the individual mental paths large\nquantities of energy which would thus flow off to no purpose,\ndiminishing the quantity available for the transformation of the outer\nworld. In the interests of expediency I therefore postulate that the\nsecond system succeeds in maintaining the greater part of the occupation\nenergy in a dormant state and in using but a small portion for the\npurposes of displacement. The mechanism of these processes is entirely\nunknown to me; anyone who wishes to follow up these ideas must try to\nfind the physical analogies and prepare the way for a demonstration of\nthe process of motion in the stimulation of the neuron. I merely hold to\nthe idea that the activity of the first \u03a8-system is directed _to the\nfree outflow of the quantities of excitement_, and that the second\nsystem brings about an inhibition of this outflow through the energies\nemanating from it, _i.e._ it produces a _transformation into dormant\nenergy, probably by raising the level_. I therefore assume that under\nthe control of the second system as compared with the first, the course\nof the excitement is bound to entirely different mechanical conditions.\nAfter the second system has finished its tentative mental work, it\nremoves the inhibition and congestion of the excitements and allows\nthese excitements to flow off to the motility.\nAn interesting train of thought now presents itself if we consider the\nrelations of this inhibition of discharge by the second system to the\nregulation through the principle of pain. Let us now seek the\ncounterpart of the primary feeling of gratification, namely, the\nobjective feeling of fear. A perceptive stimulus acts on the primitive\napparatus, becoming the source of a painful emotion. This will then be\nfollowed by irregular motor manifestations until one of these withdraws\nthe apparatus from perception and at the same time from pain, but on the\nreappearance of the perception this manifestation will immediately\nrepeat itself (perhaps as a movement of flight) until the perception has\nagain disappeared. But there will here remain no tendency again to\noccupy the perception of the source of pain in the form of an\nhallucination or in any other form. On the contrary, there will be a\ntendency in the primary apparatus to abandon the painful memory picture\nas soon as it is in any way awakened, as the overflow of its excitement\nwould surely produce (more precisely, begin to produce) pain. The\ndeviation from memory, which is but a repetition of the former flight\nfrom perception, is facilitated also by the fact that, unlike\nperception, memory does not possess sufficient quality to excite\nconsciousness and thereby to attract to itself new energy. This easy and\nregularly occurring deviation of the psychic process from the former\npainful memory presents to us the model and the first example of\n_psychic repression_. As is generally known, much of this deviation from\nthe painful, much of the behaviour of the ostrich, can be readily\ndemonstrated even in the normal psychic life of adults.\nBy virtue of the principle of pain the first system is therefore\naltogether incapable of introducing anything unpleasant into the mental\nassociations. The system cannot do anything but wish. If this remained\nso the mental activity of the second system, which should have at its\ndisposal all the memories stored up by experiences, would be hindered.\nBut two ways are now opened: the work of the second system either frees\nitself completely from the principle of pain and continues its course,\npaying no heed to the painful reminiscence, or it contrives to occupy\nthe painful memory in such a manner as to preclude the liberation of\npain. We may reject the first possibility, as the principle of pain also\nmanifests itself as a regulator for the emotional discharge of the\nsecond system; we are, therefore, directed to the second possibility,\nnamely, that this system occupies a reminiscence in such a manner as to\ninhibit its discharge and hence, also, to inhibit the discharge\ncomparable to a motor innervation for the development of pain. Thus from\ntwo starting points we are led to the hypothesis that occupation through\nthe second system is at the same time an inhibition for the emotional\ndischarge, viz. from a consideration of the principle of pain and from\nthe principle of the smallest expenditure of innervation. Let us,\nhowever, keep to the fact\u2014this is the key to the theory of\nrepression\u2014that the second system is capable of occupying an idea only\nwhen it is in position to check the development of pain emanating from\nit. Whatever withdraws itself from this inhibition also remains\ninaccessible for the second system and would soon be abandoned by virtue\nof the principle of pain. The inhibition of pain, however, need not be\ncomplete; it must be permitted to begin, as it indicates to the second\nsystem the nature of the memory and possibly its defective adaptation\nfor the purpose sought by the mind.\nThe psychic process which is admitted by the first system only I shall\nnow call the _primary_ process; and the one resulting from the\ninhibition of the second system I shall call the _secondary_ process. I\nshow by another point for what purpose the second system is obliged to\ncorrect the primary process. The primary process strives for a discharge\nof the excitement in order to establish a _perception_ identity with the\nsum of excitement thus gathered; the secondary process has abandoned\nthis intention and undertaken instead the task of bringing about a\n_thought identity_. All thinking is only a circuitous path from the\nmemory of gratification taken as an end-presentation to the identical\noccupation of the same memory, which is again to be attained on the\ntrack of the motor experiences. The state of thinking must take an\ninterest in the connecting paths between the presentations without\nallowing itself to be misled by their intensities. But it is obvious\nthat condensations and intermediate or compromise formations occurring\nin the presentations impede the attainment of this end-identity; by\nsubstituting one idea for the other they deviate from the path which\notherwise would have been continued from the original idea. Such\nprocesses are therefore carefully avoided in the secondary thinking. Nor\nis it difficult to understand that the principle of pain also impedes\nthe progress of the mental stream in its pursuit of the thought\nidentity, though, indeed, it offers to the mental stream the most\nimportant points of departure. Hence the tendency of the thinking\nprocess must be to free itself more and more from exclusive adjustment\nby the principle of pain, and through the working of the mind to\nrestrict the affective development to that minimum which is necessary as\na signal. This refinement of the activity must have been attained\nthrough a recent over-occupation of energy brought about by\nconsciousness. But we are aware that this refinement is seldom\ncompletely successful even in the most normal psychic life and that our\nthoughts ever remain accessible to falsification through the\ninterference of the principle of pain.\nThis, however, is not the breach in the functional efficiency of our\npsychic apparatus through which the thoughts forming the material of the\nsecondary mental work are enabled to make their way into the primary\npsychic process\u2014with which formula we may now describe the work leading\nto the dream and to the hysterical symptoms. This case of insufficiency\nresults from the union of the two factors from the history of our\nevolution; one of which belongs solely to the psychic apparatus and has\nexerted a determining influence on the relation of the two systems,\nwhile the other operates fluctuatingly and introduces motive forces of\norganic origin into the psychic life. Both originate in the infantile\nlife and result from the transformation which our psychic and somatic\norganism has undergone since the infantile period.\nWhen I termed one of the psychic processes in the psychic apparatus the\nprimary process, I did so not only in consideration of the order of\nprecedence and capability, but also as admitting the temporal relations\nto a share in the nomenclature. As far as our knowledge goes there is no\npsychic apparatus possessing only the primary process, and in so far it\nis a theoretic fiction; but so much is based on fact that the primary\nprocesses are present in the apparatus from the beginning, while the\nsecondary processes develop gradually in the course of life, inhibiting\nand covering the primary ones, and gaining complete mastery over them\nperhaps only at the height of life. Owing to this retarded appearance of\nthe secondary processes, the essence of our being, consisting in\nunconscious wish feelings, can neither be seized nor inhibited by the\nforeconscious, whose part is once for all restricted to the indication\nof the most suitable paths for the wish feelings originating in the\nunconscious. These unconscious wishes establish for all subsequent\npsychic efforts a compulsion to which they have to submit and which they\nmust strive if possible to divert from its course and direct to higher\naims. In consequence of this retardation of the foreconscious occupation\na large sphere of the memory material remains inaccessible.\nAmong these indestructible and unincumbered wish feelings originating\nfrom the infantile life, there are also some, the fulfilments of which\nhave entered into a relation of contradiction to the end-presentation of\nthe secondary thinking. The fulfilment of these wishes would no longer\nproduce an affect of pleasure but one of pain; _and it is just this\ntransformation of affect that constitutes the nature of what we\ndesignate as \u201crepression,\u201d in which we recognise the infantile first\nstep of passing adverse sentence or of rejecting through reason_. To\ninvestigate in what way and through what motive forces such a\ntransformation can be produced constitutes the problem of repression,\nwhich we need here only skim over. It will suffice to remark that such a\ntransformation of affect occurs in the course of development (one may\nthink of the appearance in infantile life of disgust which was\noriginally absent), and that it is connected with the activity of the\nsecondary system. The memories from which the unconscious wish brings\nabout the emotional discharge have never been accessible to the Forec.,\nand for that reason their emotional discharge cannot be inhibited. It is\njust on account of this affective development that these ideas are not\neven now accessible to the foreconscious thoughts to which they have\ntransferred their wishing power. On the contrary, the principle of pain\ncomes into play, and causes the Forec. to deviate from these thoughts of\ntransference. The latter, left to themselves, are \u201crepressed,\u201d and thus\nthe existence of a store of infantile memories, from the very beginning\nwithdrawn from the Forec., becomes the preliminary condition of\nrepression.\nIn the most favourable case the development of pain terminates as soon\nas the energy has been withdrawn from the thoughts of transference in\nthe Forec., and this effect characterises the intervention of the\nprinciple of pain as expedient. It is different, however, if the\nrepressed unconscious wish receives an organic enforcement which it can\nlend to its thoughts of transference and through which it can enable\nthem to make an effort towards penetration with their excitement, even\nafter they have been abandoned by the occupation of the Forec. A\ndefensive struggle then ensues, inasmuch as the Forec. reinforces the\nantagonism against the repressed ideas, and subsequently this leads to a\npenetration by the thoughts of transference (the carriers of the\nunconscious wish) in some form of compromise through symptom formation.\nBut from the moment that the suppressed thoughts are powerfully occupied\nby the unconscious wish-feeling and abandoned by the foreconscious\noccupation, they succumb to the primary psychic process and strive only\nfor motor discharge; or, if the path be free, for hallucinatory revival\nof the desired perception identity. We have previously found,\nempirically, that the incorrect processes described are enacted only\nwith thoughts that exist in the repression. We now grasp another part of\nthe connection. These incorrect processes are those that are primary in\nthe psychic apparatus; _they appear wherever thoughts abandoned by the\nforeconscious occupation are left to themselves, and can fill themselves\nwith the uninhibited energy, striving for discharge from the\nunconscious_. We may add a few further observations to support the view\nthat these processes designated \u201cincorrect\u201d are really not\nfalsifications of the normal defective thinking, but the modes of\nactivity of the psychic apparatus when freed from inhibition. Thus we\nsee that the transference of the foreconscious excitement to the\nmotility takes place according to the same processes, and that the\nconnection of the foreconscious presentations with words readily\nmanifest the same displacements and mixtures which are described to\ninattention. Finally, I should like to adduce proof that an increase of\nwork necessarily results from the inhibition of these primary courses\nfrom the fact that we gain a _comical effect_, a surplus to be\ndischarged through laughter, _if we allow these streams of thought to\ncome to consciousness_.\nThe theory of the psychoneuroses asserts with complete certainty that\nonly sexual wish-feelings from the infantile life experience repression\n(emotional transformation) during the developmental period of childhood.\nThese are capable of returning to activity at a later period of\ndevelopment, and then have the faculty of being revived, either as a\nconsequence of the sexual constitution, which is really formed from the\noriginal bisexuality, or in consequence of unfavourable influences of\nthe sexual life; and they thus supply the motive power for all\npsychoneurotic symptom formations. It is only by the introduction of\nthese sexual forces that the gaps still demonstrable in the theory of\nrepression can be filled. I will leave it undecided whether the\npostulate of the sexual and infantile may also be asserted for the\ntheory of the dream; I leave this here unfinished because I have already\npassed a step beyond the demonstrable in assuming that the dream-wish\ninvariably originates from the unconscious.[FY] Nor will I further\ninvestigate the difference in the play of the psychic forces in the\ndream formation and in the formation of the hysterical symptoms, for to\ndo this we ought to possess a more explicit knowledge of one of the\nmembers to be compared. But I regard another point as important, and\nwill here confess that it was on account of this very point that I have\njust undertaken this entire discussion concerning the two psychic\nsystems, their modes of operation, and the repression. For it is now\nimmaterial whether I have conceived the psychological relations in\nquestion with approximate correctness, or, as is easily possible in such\na difficult matter, in an erroneous and fragmentary manner. Whatever\nchanges may be made in the interpretation of the psychic censor and of\nthe correct and of the abnormal elaboration of the dream content, the\nfact nevertheless remains that such processes are active in dream\nformation, and that essentially they show the closest analogy to the\nprocesses observed in the formation of the hysterical symptoms. The\ndream is not a pathological phenomenon, and it does not leave behind an\nenfeeblement of the mental faculties. The objection that no deduction\ncan be drawn regarding the dreams of healthy persons from my own dreams\nand from those of neurotic patients may be rejected without comment.\nHence, when we draw conclusions from the phenomena as to their motive\nforces, we recognise that the psychic mechanism made use of by the\nneuroses is not created by a morbid disturbance of the psychic life, but\nis found ready in the normal structure of the psychic apparatus. The two\npsychic systems, the censor crossing between them, the inhibition and\nthe covering of the one activity by the other, the relations of both to\nconsciousness\u2014or whatever may offer a more correct interpretation of the\nactual conditions in their stead\u2014all these belong to the normal\nstructure of our psychic instrument, and the dream points out for us one\nof the roads leading to a knowledge of this structure. If, in addition\nto our knowledge, we wish to be contented with a minimum perfectly\nestablished, we shall say that the dream gives us proof that the\n_suppressed material continues to exist even in the normal person and\nremains capable of psychic activity_. The dream itself is one of the\nmanifestations of this suppressed material; theoretically, this is true\nin _all_ cases; according to substantial experience it is true in at\nleast a great number of such as most conspicuously display the prominent\ncharacteristics of dream life. The suppressed psychic material, which in\nthe waking state has been prevented from expression and cut off from\ninternal perception _by the antagonistic adjustment of the\ncontradictions_, finds ways and means of obtruding itself on\nconsciousness during the night under the domination of the compromise\nformations.\n\u201c_Flectere si nequeo superos, Acheronta movebo._\u201d\nAt any rate the interpretation of dreams is the _via regia_ to a\nknowledge of the unconscious in the psychic life.\nIn following the analysis of the dream we have made some progress toward\nan understanding of the composition of this most marvellous and most\nmysterious of instruments; to be sure, we have not gone very far, but\nenough of a beginning has been made to allow us to advance from other\nso-called pathological formations further into the analysis of the\nunconscious. Disease\u2014at least that which is justly termed functional\u2014is\nnot due to the destruction of this apparatus, and the establishment of\nnew splittings in its interior; it is rather to be explained dynamically\nthrough the strengthening and weakening of the components in the play of\nforces by which so many activities are concealed during the normal\nfunction. We have been able to show in another place how the composition\nof the apparatus from the two systems permits a subtilisation even of\nthe normal activity which would be impossible for a single system.[FZ]\n(_f_) _The Unconscious and Consciousness\u2014Reality._\nOn closer inspection we find that it is not the existence of two systems\nnear the motor end of the apparatus but of two kinds of processes or\nmodes of emotional discharge, the assumption of which was explained in\nthe psychological discussions of the previous chapter. This can make no\ndifference for us, for we must always be ready to drop our auxiliary\nideas whenever we deem ourselves in position to replace them by\nsomething else approaching more closely to the unknown reality. Let us\nnow try to correct some views which might be erroneously formed as long\nas we regarded the two systems in the crudest and most obvious sense as\ntwo localities within the psychic apparatus, views which have left their\ntraces in the terms \u201crepression\u201d and \u201cpenetration.\u201d Thus, when we say\nthat an unconscious idea strives for transference into the foreconscious\nin order later to penetrate consciousness, we do not mean that a second\nidea is to be formed situated in a new locality like an interlineation\nnear which the original continues to remain; also, when we speak of\npenetration into consciousness, we wish carefully to avoid any idea of\nchange of locality. When we say that a foreconscious idea is repressed\nand subsequently taken up by the unconscious, we might be tempted by\nthese figures, borrowed from the idea of a struggle over a territory, to\nassume that an arrangement is really broken up in one psychic locality\nand replaced by a new one in the other locality. For these comparisons\nwe substitute what would seem to correspond better with the real state\nof affairs by saying that an energy occupation is displaced to or\nwithdrawn from a certain arrangement so that the psychic formation falls\nunder the domination of a system or is withdrawn from the same. Here\nagain we replace a topical mode of presentation by a dynamic; it is not\nthe psychic formation that appears to us as the moving factor but the\ninnervation of the same.\nI deem it appropriate and justifiable, however, to apply ourselves still\nfurther to the illustrative conception of the two systems. We shall\navoid any misapplication of this manner of representation if we remember\nthat presentations, thoughts, and psychic formations should generally\nnot be localised in the organic elements of the nervous system, but, so\nto speak, between them, where resistances and paths form the correlate\ncorresponding to them. Everything that can become an object of our\ninternal perception is virtual, like the image in the telescope produced\nby the passage of the rays of light. But we are justified in assuming\nthe existence of the systems, which have nothing psychic in themselves\nand which never become accessible to our psychic perception,\ncorresponding to the lenses of the telescope which design the image. If\nwe continue this comparison, we may say that the censor between two\nsystems corresponds to the refraction of rays during their passage into\na new medium.\nThus far we have made psychology on our own responsibility; it is now\ntime to examine the theoretical opinions governing present-day\npsychology and to test their relation to our theories. The question of\nthe unconscious in psychology is, according to the authoritative words\nof Lipps,[GA] less a psychological question than the question of\npsychology. As long as psychology settled this question with the verbal\nexplanation that the \u201cpsychic\u201d is the \u201cconscious\u201d and that \u201cunconscious\npsychic occurrences\u201d are an obvious contradiction, a psychological\nestimate of the observations gained by the physician from abnormal\nmental states was precluded. The physician and the philosopher agree\nonly when both acknowledge that unconscious psychic processes are \u201cthe\nappropriate and well-justified expression for an established fact.\u201d The\nphysician cannot but reject with a shrug of his shoulders the assertion\nthat \u201cconsciousness is the indispensable quality of the psychic\u201d; he may\nassume, if his respect for the utterings of the philosophers still be\nstrong enough, that he and they do not treat the same subject and do not\npursue the same science. For a single intelligent observation of the\npsychic life of a neurotic, a single analysis of a dream must force upon\nhim the unalterable conviction that the most complicated and correct\nmental operations, to which no one will refuse the name of psychic\noccurrences, may take place without exciting the consciousness of the\nperson. It is true that the physician does not learn of these\nunconscious processes until they have exerted such an effect on\nconsciousness as to admit communication or observation. But this effect\nof consciousness may show a psychic character widely differing from the\nunconscious process, so that the internal perception cannot possibly\nrecognise the one as a substitute for the other. The physician must\nreserve for himself the right to penetrate, by a process of deduction,\nfrom the effect on consciousness to the unconscious psychic process; he\nlearns in this way that the effect on consciousness is only a remote\npsychic product of the unconscious process and that the latter has not\nbecome conscious as such; that it has been in existence and operative\nwithout betraying itself in any way to consciousness.\nA reaction from the over-estimation of the quality of consciousness\nbecomes the indispensable preliminary condition for any correct insight\ninto the behaviour of the psychic. In the words of Lipps, the\nunconscious must be accepted as the general basis of the psychic life.\nThe unconscious is the larger circle which includes within itself the\nsmaller circle of the conscious; everything conscious has its\npreliminary step in the unconscious, whereas the unconscious may stop\nwith this step and still claim full value as a psychic activity.\nProperly speaking, the unconscious is the real psychic; _its inner\nnature is just as unknown to us as the reality of the external world,\nand it is just as imperfectly reported to us through the data of\nconsciousness as is the external world through the indications of our\nsensory organs_.\nA series of dream problems which have intensely occupied older authors\nwill be laid aside when the old opposition between conscious life and\ndream life is abandoned and the unconscious psychic assigned to its\nproper place. Thus many of the activities whose performances in the\ndream have excited our admiration are now no longer to be attributed to\nthe dream but to unconscious thinking, which is also active during the\nday. If, according to Scherner, the dream seems to play with a\nsymbolising representation of the body, we know that this is the work of\ncertain unconscious phantasies which have probably given in to sexual\nemotions, and that these phantasies come to expression not only in\ndreams but also in hysterical phobias and in other symptoms. If the\ndream continues and settles activities of the day and even brings to\nlight valuable inspirations, we have only to subtract from it the dream\ndisguise as a feat of dream-work and a mark of assistance from obscure\nforces in the depth of the mind (_cf._ the devil in Tartini\u2019s sonata\ndream). The intellectual task as such must be attributed to the same\npsychic forces which perform all such tasks during the day. We are\nprobably far too much inclined to over-estimate the conscious character\neven of intellectual and artistic productions. From the communications\nof some of the most highly productive persons, such as Goethe and\nHelmholtz, we learn, indeed, that the most essential and original parts\nin their creations came to them in the form of inspirations and reached\ntheir perceptions almost finished. There is nothing strange about the\nassistance of the conscious activity in other cases where there was a\nconcerted effort of all the psychic forces. But it is a much abused\nprivilege of the conscious activity that it is allowed to hide from us\nall other activities wherever it participates.\nIt will hardly be worth while to take up the historical significance of\ndreams as a special subject. Where, for instance, a chieftain has been\nurged through a dream to engage in a bold undertaking the success of\nwhich has had the effect of changing history, a new problem results only\nso long as the dream, regarded as a strange power, is contrasted with\nother more familiar psychic forces; the problem, however, disappears\nwhen we regard the dream as a form of expression for feelings which are\nburdened with resistance during the day and which can receive\nreinforcements at night from deep emotional sources.[GB] But the great\nrespect shown by the ancients for the dream is based on a correct\npsychological surmise. It is a homage paid to the unsubdued and\nindestructible in the human mind, and to the demoniacal which furnishes\nthe dream-wish and which we find again in our unconscious.\nNot inadvisedly do I use the expression \u201cin our unconscious,\u201d for what\nwe so designate does not coincide with the unconscious of the\nphilosophers, nor with the unconscious of Lipps. In the latter uses it\nis intended to designate only the opposite of conscious. That there are\nalso unconscious psychic processes beside the conscious ones is the\nhotly contested and energetically defended issue. Lipps gives us the\nmore far-reaching theory that everything psychic exists as unconscious,\nbut that some of it may exist also as conscious. But it was not to prove\nthis theory that we have adduced the phenomena of the dream and of the\nhysterical symptom formation; the observation of normal life alone\nsuffices to establish its correctness beyond any doubt. The new fact\nthat we have learned from the analysis of the psychopathological\nformations, and indeed from their first member, viz. dreams, is that the\nunconscious\u2014hence the psychic\u2014occurs as a function of two separate\nsystems and that it occurs as such even in normal psychic life.\nConsequently there are two kinds of unconscious, which we do not as yet\nfind distinguished by the psychologists. Both are unconscious in the\npsychological sense; but in our sense the first, which we call Unc., is\nlikewise incapable of consciousness, whereas the second we term \u201cForec.\u201d\nbecause its emotions, after the observance of certain rules, can reach\nconsciousness, perhaps not before they have again undergone censorship,\nbut still regardless of the Unc. system. The fact that in order to\nattain consciousness the emotions must traverse an unalterable series of\nevents or succession of instances, as is betrayed through their\nalteration by the censor, has helped us to draw a comparison from\nspatiality. We described the relations of the two systems to each other\nand to consciousness by saying that the system Forec. is like a screen\nbetween the system Unc. and consciousness. The system Forec. not only\nbars access to consciousness, but also controls the entrance to\nvoluntary motility and is capable of sending out a sum of mobile energy,\na portion of which is familiar to us as attention.\nWe must also steer clear of the distinctions superconscious and\nsubconscious which have found so much favour in the more recent\nliterature on the psychoneuroses, for just such a distinction seems to\nemphasize the equivalence of the psychic and the conscious.\nWhat part now remains in our description of the once all-powerful and\nall-overshadowing consciousness? None other than that of a sensory organ\nfor the perception of psychic qualities. According to the fundamental\nidea of schematic undertaking we can conceive the conscious perception\nonly as the particular activity of an independent system for which the\nabbreviated designation \u201cCons.\u201d commends itself. This system we conceive\nto be similar in its mechanical characteristics to the perception system\nP, hence excitable by qualities and incapable of retaining the trace of\nchanges, _i.e._ it is devoid of memory. The psychic apparatus which,\nwith the sensory organs of the P-systems, is turned to the outer world,\nis itself the outer world for the sensory organ of Cons.; the\nteleological justification of which rests on this relationship. We are\nhere once more confronted with the principle of the succession of\ninstances which seems to dominate the structure of the apparatus. The\nmaterial under excitement flows to the Cons. sensory organ from two\nsides, firstly from the P-system whose excitement, qualitatively\ndetermined, probably experiences a new elaboration until it comes to\nconscious perception; and, secondly, from the interior of the apparatus\nitself, the quantitative processes of which are perceived as a\nqualitative series of pleasure and pain as soon as they have undergone\ncertain changes.\nThe philosophers, who have learned that correct and highly complicated\nthought structures are possible even without the co-operation of\nconsciousness, have found it difficult to attribute any function to\nconsciousness; it has appeared to them a superfluous mirroring of the\nperfected psychic process. The analogy of our Cons. system with the\nsystems of perception relieves us of this embarrassment. We see that\nperception through our sensory organs results in directing the\noccupation of attention to those paths on which the incoming sensory\nexcitement is diffused; the qualitative excitement of the P-system\nserves the mobile quantity of the psychic apparatus as a regulator for\nits discharge. We may claim the same function for the overlying sensory\norgan of the Cons. system. By assuming new qualities, it furnishes a new\ncontribution toward the guidance and suitable distribution of the mobile\noccupation quantities. By means of the perceptions of pleasure and pain,\nit influences the course of the occupations within the psychic\napparatus, which normally operates unconsciously and through the\ndisplacement of quantities. It is probable that the principle of pain\nfirst regulates the displacements of occupation automatically, but it is\nquite possible that the consciousness of these qualities adds a second\nand more subtle regulation which may even oppose the first and perfect\nthe working capacity of the apparatus by placing it in a position\ncontrary to its original design for occupying and developing even that\nwhich is connected with the liberation of pain. We learn from\nneuropsychology that an important part in the functional activity of the\napparatus is attributed to such regulations through the qualitative\nexcitation of the sensory organs. The automatic control of the primary\nprinciple of pain and the restriction of mental capacity connected with\nit are broken by the sensible regulations, which in their turn are again\nautomatisms. We learn that the repression which, though originally\nexpedient, terminates nevertheless in a harmful rejection of inhibition\nand of psychic domination, is so much more easily accomplished with\nreminiscences than with perceptions, because in the former there is no\nincrease in occupation through the excitement of the psychic sensory\norgans. When an idea to be rejected has once failed to become conscious\nbecause it has succumbed to repression, it can be repressed on other\noccasions only because it has been withdrawn from conscious perception\non other grounds. These are hints employed by therapy in order to bring\nabout a retrogression of accomplished repressions.\nThe value of the over-occupation which is produced by the regulating\ninfluence of the Cons. sensory organ on the mobile quantity, is\ndemonstrated in the teleological connection by nothing more clearly than\nby the creation of a new series of qualities and consequently a new\nregulation which constitutes the precedence of man over the animals. For\nthe mental processes are in themselves devoid of quality except for the\nexcitements of pleasure and pain accompanying them, which, as we know,\nare to be held in check as possible disturbances of thought. In order to\nendow them with a quality, they are associated in man with verbal\nmemories, the qualitative remnants of which suffice to draw upon them\nthe attention of consciousness which in turn endows thought with a new\nmobile energy.\nThe manifold problems of consciousness in their entirety can be examined\nonly through an analysis of the hysterical mental process. From this\nanalysis we receive the impression that the transition from the\nforeconscious to the occupation of consciousness is also connected with\na censorship similar to the one between the Unc. and the Forec. This\ncensorship, too, begins to act only with the reaching of a certain\nquantitative degree, so that few intense thought formations escape it.\nEvery possible case of detention from consciousness, as well as of\npenetration to consciousness, under restriction is found included within\nthe picture of the psychoneurotic phenomena; every case points to the\nintimate and two-fold connection between the censor and consciousness. I\nshall conclude these psychological discussions with the report of two\nsuch occurrences.\nOn the occasion of a consultation a few years ago the subject was an\nintelligent and innocent-looking girl. Her attire was strange; whereas a\nwoman\u2019s garb is usually groomed to the last fold, she had one of her\nstockings hanging down and two of her waist buttons opened. She\ncomplained of pains in one of her legs, and exposed her leg unrequested.\nHer chief complaint, however, was in her own words as follows: She had a\nfeeling in her body as if something was stuck into it which moved to and\nfro and made her tremble through and through. This sometimes made her\nwhole body stiff. On hearing this, my colleague in consultation looked\nat me; the complaint was quite plain to him. To both of us it seemed\npeculiar that the patient\u2019s mother thought nothing of the matter; of\ncourse she herself must have been repeatedly in the situation described\nby her child. As for the girl, she had no idea of the import of her\nwords or she would never have allowed them to pass her lips. Here the\ncensor had been deceived so successfully that under the mask of an\ninnocent complaint a phantasy was admitted to consciousness which\notherwise would have remained in the foreconscious.\nAnother example: I began the psychoanalytic treatment of a boy of\nfourteen years who was suffering from _tic convulsif_, hysterical\nvomiting, headache, &c., by assuring him that, after closing his eyes,\nhe would see pictures or have ideas, which I requested him to\ncommunicate to me. He answered by describing pictures. The last\nimpression he had received before coming to me was visually revived in\nhis memory. He had played a game of checkers with his uncle, and now saw\nthe checker-board before him. He commented on various positions that\nwere favourable or unfavourable, on moves that were not safe to make. He\nthen saw a dagger lying on the checker-board, an object belonging to his\nfather, but transferred to the checker-board by his phantasy. Then a\nsickle was lying on the board; next a scythe was added; and, finally, he\nbeheld the likeness of an old peasant mowing the grass in front of the\nboy\u2019s distant parental home. A few days later I discovered the meaning\nof this series of pictures. Disagreeable family relations had made the\nboy nervous. It was the case of a strict and crabbed father who lived\nunhappily with his mother, and whose educational methods consisted in\nthreats; of the separation of his father from his tender and delicate\nmother, and the remarrying of his father, who one day brought home a\nyoung woman as his new mamma. The illness of the fourteen-year-old boy\nbroke out a few days later. It was the suppressed anger against his\nfather that had composed these pictures into intelligible allusions. The\nmaterial was furnished by a reminiscence from mythology. The sickle was\nthe one with which Zeus castrated his father; the scythe and the\nlikeness of the peasant represented Kronos, the violent old man who eats\nhis children and upon whom Zeus wreaks vengeance in so unfilial a\nmanner. The marriage of the father gave the boy an opportunity to return\nthe reproaches and threats of his father\u2014which had previously been made\nbecause the child played with his genitals (the checker-board; the\nprohibitive moves; the dagger with which a person may be killed). We\nhave here long repressed memories and their unconscious remnants which,\nunder the guise of senseless pictures have slipped into consciousness by\ndevious paths left open to them.\nI should then expect to find the theoretical value of the study of\ndreams in its contribution to psychological knowledge and in its\npreparation for an understanding of neuroses. Who can foresee the\nimportance of a thorough knowledge of the structure and activities of\nthe psychic apparatus when even our present state of knowledge produces\na happy therapeutic influence in the curable forms of the\npsychoneuroses? What about the practical value of such study someone may\nask, for psychic knowledge and for the discovering of the secret\npeculiarities of individual character? Have not the unconscious feelings\nrevealed by the dream the value of real forces in the psychic life?\nShould we take lightly the ethical significance of the suppressed wishes\nwhich, as they now create dreams, may some day create other things?\nI do not feel justified in answering these questions. I have not thought\nfurther upon this side of the dream problem. I believe, however, that at\nall events the Roman Emperor was in the wrong who ordered one of his\nsubjects executed because the latter dreamt that he had killed the\nEmperor. He should first have endeavoured to discover the significance\nof the dream; most probably it was not what it seemed to be. And even if\na dream of different content had the significance of this offence\nagainst majesty, it would still have been in place to remember the words\nof Plato, that the virtuous man contents himself with dreaming that\nwhich the wicked man does in actual life. I am therefore of the opinion\nthat it is best to accord freedom to dreams. Whether any reality is to\nbe attributed to the unconscious wishes, and in what sense, I am not\nprepared to say offhand. Reality must naturally be denied to all\ntransition\u2014and intermediate thoughts. If we had before us the\nunconscious wishes, brought to their last and truest expression, we\nshould still do well to remember that more than one single form of\nexistence must be ascribed to the psychic reality. Action and the\nconscious expression of thought mostly suffice for the practical need of\njudging a man\u2019s character. Action, above all, merits to be placed in the\nfirst rank; for many of the impulses penetrating consciousness are\nneutralised by real forces of the psychic life before they are converted\ninto action; indeed, the reason why they frequently do not encounter any\npsychic obstacle on their way is because the unconscious is certain of\ntheir meeting with resistances later. In any case it is instructive to\nbecome familiar with the much raked-up soil from which our virtues\nproudly arise. For the complication of human character moving\ndynamically in all directions very rarely accommodates itself to\nadjustment through a simple alternative, as our antiquated moral\nphilosophy would have it.\nAnd how about the value of the dream for a knowledge of the future?\nThat, of course, we cannot consider.[GC] One feels inclined to\nsubstitute: \u201cfor a knowledge of the past.\u201d For the dream originates from\nthe past in every sense. To be sure the ancient belief that the dream\nreveals the future is not entirely devoid of truth. By representing to\nus a wish as fulfilled the dream certainly leads us into the future; but\nthis future, taken by the dreamer as present, has been formed into the\nlikeness of that past by the indestructible wish.\nVIII\nLITERARY INDEX\nFootnote 1:\nAristoteles. _\u00dcber Tr\u00e4ume und Traumdeutungen._ Translated by Bender.\nFootnote 2:\nArtemidoros aus Daldis. _Symbolik der Tr\u00e4ume._ Translated by\nFriedrich.

Gruppe, _Griechische Mythologie und\nReligionsgeschichte_, p. 390. \u201cDreams were divided into two classes;\nthe first were influenced only by the present (or past), and were\nunimportant for the future: they embraced the \u1f10\u03bd\u03cd\u03c0\u03bd\u03b9\u03b1, insomnia, which\nimmediately produces the given idea or its opposite, _e.g._ hunger or\nits satiation, and the \u03c6\u03b1\u03bd\u03c4\u03ac\u03c3\u03bc\u03b1\u03c4\u03b1, which elaborates the given idea\nphantastically, as _e.g._ the nightmare, ephialtes. The second class\nwas, on the other hand, determinant for the future. To this belong:\n(1) direct prophecies received in the dream (\u03c7\u03c1\u03b7\u03bc\u03b1\u03c4\u03b9\u03c3\u03bc\u03cc\u03c2, oraculum);\n(2) the foretelling of a future event (\u1f45\u03c1\u03b1\u03bc\u03b1); (3) the symbolic or the\ndream requiring interpretation (\u1f44\u03bd\u03b5\u03b9\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2, somnium). This theory has\nbeen preserved for many centuries.\u201d\nFootnote F:\nFrom subsequent experience I am able to state that it is not at all\nrare to find in dreams repetitions of harmless or unimportant\noccupations of the waking state, such as packing trunks, preparing\nfood, work in the kitchen, &c., but in such dreams the dreamer himself\nemphasizes not the character but the reality of the memory, \u201cI have\nreally done all this in the day time.\u201d\nFootnote G:\n_Chauffeurs_ were bands of robbers in the Vend\u00e9e who resorted to this\nform of torture.\nFootnote H:\nGigantic persons in a dream justify the assumption that it deals with\na scene from the dreamer\u2019s childhood.\nFootnote I:\nThe first volume of this Norwegian author, containing a complete\ndescription of dreams, has recently appeared in German. See Index of\nLiterature, No. [74a].\nFootnote J:\nPeriodically recurrent dreams have been observed repeatedly. _Cf._ the\ncollection of Chabaneix.[11]\nFootnote K:\nSilberer has shown by nice examples how in the state of sleepiness\neven abstract thoughts may be changed into illustrative plastic\npictures which express the same thing (_Jahrbuch_ von Bleuler-Freud,\nvol. i. 1900).\nFootnote L:\nHaffner[32] made an attempt similar to Delb\u0153uf\u2019s to explain the dream\nactivity on the basis of an alteration which must result in an\nintroduction of an abnormal condition in the otherwise correct\nfunction of the intact psychic apparatus, but he described this\ncondition in somewhat different words. He states that the first\ndistinguishing mark of the dream is the absence of time and space,\n_i.e._ the emancipation of the presentation from the position in the\norder of time and space which is common to the individual. Allied to\nthis is the second fundamental character of the dream, the mistaking\nof the hallucinations, imaginations, and phantasy-combinations for\nobjective perceptions. The sum total of the higher psychic forces,\nespecially formation of ideas, judgment, and argumentation on the one\nhand, and the free self-determination on the other hand, connect\nthemselves with the sensory phantasy pictures and at all times have\nthem as a substratum. These activities too, therefore, participate in\nthe irregularity of the dream presentation. We say they participate,\nfor our faculties of judgment and will power are in themselves in no\nway altered during sleep. In reference to activity, we are just as\nkeen and just as free as in the waking state. A man cannot act\ncontrary to the laws of thought, even in the dream, _i.e._ he is\nunable to harmonise with that which represents itself as contrary to\nhim, &c.; he can only desire in the dream that which he presents to\nhimself as good (_sub ratione boni_). But in this application of the\nlaws of thinking and willing the human mind is led astray in the dream\nthrough mistaking one presentation for another. It thus happens that\nwe form and commit in the dream the greatest contradictions, while, on\nthe other hand, we display the keenest judgments and the most\nconsequential chains of reasoning, and can make the most virtuous and\nsacred resolutions. Lack of orientation is the whole secret of the\nflight by which our phantasy moves in the dream, and lack of critical\nreflection and mutual understanding with others is the main source of\nthe reckless extravagances of our judgments, hopes, and wishes in the\ndream (p. 18).\nFootnote M:\n_Cf._ Haffner[32] and Spitta[64].\nFootnote N:\n_Grundz\u00fcge des Systems der Anthropologie._ Erlangen, 1850 (quoted by\nSpitta).\nFootnote O:\n_Das Traumleben und seine Deutung_, 1868 (cited by Spitta, p. 192).\nFootnote P:\nH. Swoboda, _Die Perioden des Menschlichen Organismus_, 1904.\nFootnote Q:\nIn a novel, _Gradiva_, of the poet W. Jensen, I accidentally\ndiscovered several artificial dreams which were formed with perfect\ncorrectness and which could be interpreted as though they had not been\ninvented, but had been dreamt by actual persons. The poet declared,\nupon my inquiry, that he was unacquainted with my theory of dreams. I\nhave made use of this correspondence between my investigation and the\ncreative work of the poet as a proof of the correctness of my method\nof dream analysis (\u201cDer Wahn und die Tr\u00e4ume,\u201d in W. Jensen\u2019s\n_Gradiva_, No. 1 of the _Schriften zur angewandten Seelenkunde_, 1906,\nedited by me). Dr. Alfred Robitsek has since shown that the dream of\nthe hero in Goethe\u2019s _Egmont_ may be interpreted as correctly as an\nactually experienced dream (\u201cDie Analyse von Egmont\u2019s Tr\u00e4ume,\u201d\n_Jahrbuch_, edited by Bleuler-Freud, vol. ii., 1910.)\nFootnote R:\nAfter the completion of my manuscript, a paper by Stumpf[65] came to\nmy notice which agrees with my work in attempting to prove that the\ndream is full of meaning and capable of interpretation. But the\ninterpretation is undertaken by means of an allegorising symbolism,\nwithout warrant for the universal applicability of the procedure.\nFootnote S:\nDr. Alfred Robitsek calls my attention to the fact that Oriental dream\nbooks, of which ours are pitiful plagiarisms, undertake the\ninterpretation of dream elements, mostly according to the assonance\nand similarity of the words. Since these relationships must be lost by\ntranslation into our language, the incomprehensibility of the\nsubstitutions in our popular \u201cdream books\u201d may have its origin in this\nfact. Information as to the extraordinary significance of puns and\npunning in ancient Oriental systems of culture may be found in the\nwritings of Hugo Winckler. The nicest example of a dream\ninterpretation which has come down to us from antiquity is based on a\nplay upon words. Artemidoros[2] relates the following (p. 225): \u201cIt\nseems to me that Aristandros gives a happy interpretation to Alexander\nof Macedon. When the latter held Tyros shut in and in a state of\nsiege, and was angry and depressed over the great loss of time, he\ndreamed that he saw a Satyros dancing on his shield. It happened that\nAristandros was near Tyros and in the convoy of the king, who was\nwaging war on the Syrians. By disjoining the word Satyros into \u03c3\u03b1 and\n\u03c4\u03cd\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2, he induced the king to become more aggressive in the siege, and\nthus he became master of the city. (\u03a3\u03b1 \u03c4\u03cd\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2\u2014thine is Tyros.) The\ndream, indeed, is so intimately connected with verbal expression that\nFerenczi[87] may justly remark that every tongue has its own dream\nlanguage. Dreams are, as a rule, not translatable into other\nlanguages.\u201d\nFootnote T:\nBreuer and Freud, _Studien \u00fcber Hysterie_, Vienna, 1895; 2nd ed. 1909.\nFootnote U:\nThe complaint, as yet unexplained, of pains in the abdomen, may also\nbe referred to this third person. It is my own wife, of course, who is\nin question; the abdominal pains remind me of one of the occasions\nupon which her shyness became evident to me. I must myself admit that\nI do not treat Irma and my wife very gallantly in this dream, but let\nit be said for my excuse that I am judging both of them by the\nstandard of the courageous, docile, female patient.\nFootnote V:\nI suspect that the interpretation of this portion has not been carried\nfar enough to follow every hidden meaning. If I were to continue the\ncomparison of the three women, I would go far afield. Every dream has\nat least one point at which it is unfathomable, a central point, as it\nwere, connecting it with the unknown.\nFootnote W:\n\u201cAnanas,\u201d moreover, has a remarkable assonance to the family name of\nmy patient Irma.\nFootnote X:\nIn this the dream did not turn out to be prophetic. But in another\nsense, it proved correct, for the \u201cunsolved\u201d stomach pains, for which\nI did not want to be to blame, were the forerunners of a serious\nillness caused by gall stones.\nFootnote Y:\nEven if I have not, as may be understood, given account of everything\nwhich occurred to me in connection with the work of interpretation.\nFootnote Z:\nThe facts about dreams of thirst were known also to Weygandt,[75] who\nexpresses himself about them (p. 11) as follows: \u201cIt is just the\nsensation of thirst which is most accurately registered of all; it\nalways causes a representation of thirst quenching. The manner in\nwhich the dream pictures the act of thirst quenching is manifold, and\nis especially apt to be formed according to a recent reminiscence.\nHere also a universal phenomenon is that disappointment in the slight\nefficacy of the supposed refreshments sets in immediately after the\nidea that thirst has been quenched.\u201d But he overlooks the fact that\nthe reaction of the dream to the stimulus is universal. If other\npersons who are troubled by thirst at night awake without dreaming\nbeforehand, this does not constitute an objection to my experiment,\nbut characterises those others as persons who sleep poorly.\nFootnote AA:\nThe dream afterwards accomplished the same purpose in the case of the\ngrandmother, who is older than the child by about seventy years, as it\ndid in the case of the granddaughter. After she had been forced to go\nhungry for several days on account of the restlessness of her floating\nkidney, she dreamed, apparently with a transference into the happy\ntime of her flowering maidenhood, that she had been \u201casked out,\u201d\ninvited as a guest for both the important meals, and each time had\nbeen served with the most delicious morsels.\nFootnote AB:\nA more searching investigation into the psychic life of the child\nteaches us, to be sure, that sexual motive powers in infantile forms,\nwhich have been too long overlooked, play a sufficiently great part in\nthe psychic activity of the child. This raises some doubt as to the\nhappiness of the child, as imagined later by the adults. _Cf._ the\nauthor\u2019s \u201cThree Contributions to the Sexual Theory,\u201d translated by A.\nA. Brill, _Journal of Nervous and Mental Diseases_ Publishing Company.\nFootnote AC:\nIt should not be left unmentioned that children sometimes show complex\nand more obscure dreams, while, on the other hand, adults will often\nunder certain conditions show dreams of an infantile character. How\nrich in unsuspected material the dreams of children of from four to\nfive years might be is shown by examples in my \u201cAnalyse der Phobie\neines f\u00fcnfj\u00e4hrigen Knaben\u201d (_Jahrbuch_, ed. by Bleuler & Freud, 1909),\nand in Jung\u2019s \u201cUeber Konflikte der kindlichen Seele\u201d (ebda. ii. vol.,\n1910). On the other hand, it seems that dreams of an infantile type\nreappear especially often in adults if they are transferred to unusual\nconditions of life. Thus Otto Nordenskjold, in his book _Antarctic_\n(1904), writes as follows about the crew who passed the winter with\nhim. \u201cVery characteristic for the trend of our inmost thoughts were\nour dreams, which were never more vivid and numerous than at present.\nEven those of our comrades with whom dreaming had formerly been an\nexception had long stories to tell in the morning when we exchanged\nour experiences in the world of phantasies. They all referred to that\nouter world which was now so far from us, but they often fitted into\nour present relations. An especially characteristic dream was the one\nin which one of our comrades believed himself back on the bench at\nschool, where the task was assigned him of skinning miniature seals\nwhich were especially made for the purposes of instruction. Eating and\ndrinking formed the central point around which most of our dreams were\ngrouped. One of us, who was fond of going to big dinner parties at\nnight, was exceedingly glad if he could report in the morning \u2018that he\nhad had a dinner consisting of three courses.\u2019 Another dreamed of\ntobacco\u2014of whole mountains of tobacco; still another dreamed of a ship\napproaching on the open sea under full sail. Still another dream\ndeserves to be mentioned. The letter carrier brought the mail, and\ngave a long explanation of why he had had to wait so long for it; he\nhad delivered it at the wrong place, and only after great effort had\nbeen able to get it back. To be sure, we occupied ourselves in sleep\nwith still more impossible things, but the lack of phantasy in almost\nall the dreams which I myself dreamed or heard others relate was quite\nstriking. It would surely have been of great psychological interest if\nall the dreams could have been noted. But one can readily understand\nhow we longed for sleep. It alone could afford us everything that we\nall most ardently desired.\u201d\nFootnote AD:\nA Hungarian proverb referred to by Ferenczi[87] states more explicitly\nthat \u201cthe pig dreams of acorns, the goose of maize.\u201d\nFootnote AE:\nIt is quite incredible with what stubbornness readers and critics\nexclude this consideration, and leave unheeded the fundamental\ndifferentiation between the manifest and the latent dream content.\nFootnote AF:\nIt is remarkable how my memory narrows here for the purposes of\nanalysis\u2014while I am awake. I have known five of my uncles, and have\nloved and honoured one of them. But at the moment when I overcame my\nresistance to the interpretation of the dream I said to myself, \u201cI\nhave only one uncle, the one who is intended in the dream.\u201d\nFootnote AG:\nThe word is here used in the original Latin sense _instantia_, meaning\nenergy, continuance or persistence in doing. (Translator.)\nFootnote AH:\nSuch hypocritical dreams are not unusual occurrences with me or with\nothers. While I am working up a certain scientific problem, I am\nvisited for many nights in rapid succession by a somewhat confusing\ndream which has as its content reconciliation with a friend long ago\ndropped. After three or four attempts, I finally succeeded in grasping\nthe meaning of this dream. It was in the nature of an encouragement to\ngive up the little consideration still left for the person in\nquestion, to drop him completely, but it disguised itself shamefacedly\nin the opposite feeling. I have reported a \u201chypocritical Oedipus\ndream\u201d of a person, in which the hostile feelings and the wishes of\ndeath of the dream thoughts were replaced by manifest tenderness.\n(\u201cTypisches Beispiel eines verkappten Oedipustraumes,\u201d _Zentralblatt\nf\u00fcr Psychoanalyse_, Bd. 1, Heft 1\u201311, 1910.) Another class of\nhypocritical dreams will be reported in another place.\nFootnote AI:\nTo sit for the painter. Goethe: \u201cAnd if he has no backside, how can\nthe nobleman sit?\u201d\nFootnote AJ:\nI myself regret the introduction of such passages from the\npsychopathology of hysteria, which, because of their fragmentary\nrepresentation and of being torn from all connection with the subject,\ncannot have a very enlightening influence. If these passages are\ncapable of throwing light upon the intimate relations between the\ndream and the psychoneuroses, they have served the purpose for which I\nhave taken them up.\nFootnote AK:\nSomething like the smoked salmon in the dream of the deferred supper.\nFootnote AL:\nIt often happens that a dream is told incompletely, and that a\nrecollection of the omitted portions appears only in the course of the\nanalysis. These portions subsequently fitted in, regularly furnish the\nkey to the interpretation. _Cf._ below, about forgetting in dreams.\nFootnote AM:\nSimilar \u201ccounter wish-dreams\u201d have been repeatedly reported to me\nwithin the last few years by my pupils who thus reacted to their first\nencounter with the \u201cwish theory of the dream.\u201d\nFootnote AN:\nWe may mention here the simplification and modification of this\nfundamental formula, propounded by Otto Rank: \u201cOn the basis and with\nthe help of repressed infantile sexual material, the dream regularly\nrepresents as fulfilled actual, and as a rule also erotic, wishes, in\na disguised and symbolic form.\u201d (\u201cEin Traum, der sich selbst deutet,\u201d\n_Jahrbuch_, v., Bleuler-Freud, II. B., p. 519, 1910.)\nFootnote AO:\nSee _Selected Papers on Hysteria and other Psychoneuroses_, p. 133,\ntranslated by A. A. Brill, _Journal of Nervous and Mental Diseases_,\nMonograph Series.\nFootnote AP:\nIt is clear that the conception of Robert, that the dream is intended\nto rid our memory of the useless impressions which it has received\nduring the day, is no longer tenable, if indifferent memories of\nchildhood appear in the dream with some degree of frequency. The\nconclusion would have to be drawn that the dream ordinarily performs\nvery inadequately the duty which is prescribed for it.\nFootnote AQ:\nAs mentioned in the first chapter, p. 67, H. Swoboda applies broadly\nto the psychic activity, the biological intervals of twenty-three and\ntwenty-eight days discovered by W. Fliess, and lays especial emphasis\nupon the fact that these periods are determinant for the appearance of\nthe dream elements in dreams. There would be no material change in\ndream interpretation if this could be proven, but it would result in a\nnew source for the origin of the dream material. I have recently\nundertaken some examination of my own dreams in order to test the\napplicability of the \u201cPeriod Theory\u201d to the dream material, and I have\nselected for this purpose especially striking elements of the dream\ncontent, whose origin could be definitely ascertained:\u2014\nI.\u2014_Dream from October 1\u20132, 1910_\n(Fragment).... Somewhere in Italy. Three daughters show me small\ncostly objects, as if in an antiquity shop. At the same time they sit\ndown on my lap. Of one of the pieces I remark: \u201cWhy, you got this from\nme.\u201d I also see distinctly a small profile mask with the angular\nfeatures of Savonarola.\nWhen have I last seen a picture of Savonarola? According to my\ntravelling diary, I was in Florence on the fourth and fifth of\nSeptember, and while there thought of showing my travelling companion\nthe plaster medallion of the features of the fanatical monk in the\nPiazza Signoria, the same place where he met his death by burning. I\nbelieve that I called his attention to it at 3 A.M. To be sure, from\nthis impression, until its return in the dream, there was an interval\nof twenty-seven and one days\u2014a \u201cfeminine period,\u201d according to Fliess.\nBut, unfortunately for the demonstrative force of this example, I must\nadd that on the very day of the dream I was visited (the first time\nafter my return) by the able but melancholy-looking colleague whom I\nhad already years before nicknamed \u201cRabbi Savonarola.\u201d He brought me a\npatient who had met with an accident on the Pottebba railroad, on\nwhich I had myself travelled eight days before, and my thoughts were\nthus turned to my last Italian journey. The appearance in the dream\ncontent of the striking element of Savonarola is explained by the\nvisit of my colleague on the day of the dream; the twenty-eight day\ninterval had no significance in its origin.\nII.\u2014_Dream from October 10\u201311_\nI am again studying chemistry in the University laboratory. Court\nCouncillor L. invites me to come to another place, and walks before me\nin the corridor carrying in front of him in his uplifted hand a lamp\nor some other instrument, and assuming a peculiar attitude, his head\nstretched forward. We then come to an open space ... (rest forgotten).\nIn this dream content, the most striking part is the manner in which\nCourt Councillor L. carries the lamp (or lupe) in front of him, his\ngaze directed into the distance. I have not seen L. for many years,\nbut I now know that he is only a substitute for another greater\nperson\u2014for Archimedes near the Arethusa fountain in Syracuse, who\nstands there exactly like L. in the dream, holding the burning mirror\nand gazing at the besieging army of the Romans. When had I first (and\nlast) seen this monument? According to my notes, it was on the\nseventeenth day of September, in the evening, and from this date to\nthe dream there really passed 13 and 10, equals 23, days-according to\nFliess, a \u201cmasculine period.\u201d\nBut I regret to say that here, too, this connection seems somewhat\nless inevitable when we enter into the interpretation of this dream.\nThe dream was occasioned by the information, received on the day of\nthe dream, that the lecture-room in the clinic in which I was invited\nto deliver my lectures had been changed to some other place. I took it\nfor granted that the new room was very inconveniently situated, and\nsaid to myself, it is as bad as not having any lecture-room at my\ndisposal. My thoughts must have then taken me back to the time when I\nfirst became a docent, when I really had no lecture-room, and when, in\nmy efforts to get one, I met with little encouragement from the very\ninfluential gentlemen councillors and professors. In my distress at\nthat time, I appealed to L., who then had the title of dean, and whom\nI considered kindly disposed. He promised to help me, but that was all\nI ever heard from him. In the dream he is the Archimedes, who gives me\nthe \u03c0\u03ae\u03c3\u03c4\u03c9 and leads me into the other room. That neither the desire\nfor revenge nor the consciousness of one\u2019s own importance is absent in\nthis dream will be readily divined by those familiar with dream\ninterpretation. I must conclude, however, that without this motive for\nthe dream, Archimedes would hardly have got into the dream that night.\nI am not certain whether the strong and still recent impression of the\nstatue in Syracuse did not also come to the surface at a different\ninterval of time.\nIII.\u2014_Dream from October 2\u20133, 1910._\n(Fragment) ... Something about Professor Oser, who himself prepared\nthe menu for me, which served to restore me to great peace of mind\n(rest forgotten).\nThe dream was a reaction to the digestive disturbances of this day,\nwhich made me consider asking one of my colleagues to arrange a diet\nfor me. That in the dream I selected for this purpose Professor Oser,\nwho had died in the summer, is based on the recent death (October 1)\nof another university teacher, whom I highly revered. But when did\nOser die, and when did I hear of his death? According to the newspaper\nnotice, he died on the 22nd of August, but as I was at the time in\nHolland, whither my Vienna newspapers were regularly sent me, I must\nhave read the obituary notice on the 24th or 25th of August. This\ninterval no longer corresponds to any period. It takes in 7 and 30 and\n2, equals 39, days, or perhaps 38 days. I cannot recall having spoken\nor thought of Oser during this interval.\nSuch intervals as were not available for the \u201cperiod theory\u201d without\nfurther elaboration, were shown from my dreams to be far more frequent\nthan the regular ones. As maintained in the text, the only thing\nconstantly found is the relation to an impression of the day of the\ndream itself.\nFootnote AR:\n_Cf._ my essay, \u201cUeber Deckerinnerungen,\u201d in the _Monatsschrift f\u00fcr\nPsychiatrie und Neurologie_, 1899.\nFootnote AS:\nGer., _bl\u00fchend_.\nFootnote AT:\nThe tendency of the dream function to fuse everything of interest\nwhich is present into simultaneous treatment has already been noticed\nby several authors, for instance, by Delage,[15] p. 41, Delb\u0153uf,[16]\n_Rapprochement Forc\u00e9_, p. 236.\nFootnote AU:\nThe dream of Irma\u2019s injection; the dream of the friend who is my\nuncle.\nFootnote AV:\nThe dream of the funeral oration of the young physician.\nFootnote AW:\nThe dream of the botanical monograph.\nFootnote AX:\nThe dreams of my patients during analysis are mostly of this kind.\nFootnote AY:\n_Cf._ Chap.

The\nreputation of the young woman never suffers on account of _fensterln_,\nunless she becomes intimate with too many suitors. (Translator.)\nFootnote BF:\nBoth the emotions which belong to these childish scenes\u2014astonishment\nand resignation to the inevitable\u2014had appeared in a dream shortly\nbefore, which was the first thing that brought back the memory of this\nchildhood experience.\nFootnote BG:\nI do not elaborate plagiostomi purposely; they recall an occasion of\nangry disgrace before the same teacher.\nFootnote BH:\n_Cf._ Maury\u2019s dream about kilo-lotto, p. 50.\nFootnote BI:\nPopo = backside in German nursery language.\nFootnote BJ:\nThis repetition has insinuated itself into the text of the dream\napparently through my absent-mindedness, and I allow it to remain\nbecause the analysis shows that it has its significance.\nFootnote BK:\nNot in _Germinal_, but in _La Terre_\u2014a mistake of which I became aware\nonly in the analysis. I may call attention also to the identity of the\nletters in _Huflattich_ and _Flatus_.\nFootnote BL:\nTranslator\u2019s note.\nFootnote BM:\nIn his significant work (\u201cPhantasie und Mythos,\u201d _Jahrbuch f\u00fcr\nPsychoanalyse_, Bd. ii., 1910), H. Silberer has endeavoured to show\nfrom this part of the dream that the dream-work is able to reproduce\nnot only the latent dream thoughts, but also the psychic processes in\nthe dream formation (\u201cDas functionale Ph\u00e4nomen\u201d).\nFootnote BN:\nAnother interpretation: He is one-eyed like Odin, the father of the\ngods ... Odin\u2019s consolation. The consolation in the childish scene,\nthat I will buy him a new bed.\nFootnote BO:\nI here add some material for interpretation. Holding the urinal\nrecalls the story of a peasant who tries one glass after another at\nthe opticians, but still cannot read (peasant-catcher, like\ngirl-catcher in a portion of the dream). The treatment among the\npeasants of the father who has become weak-minded in Zola\u2019s _La\nTerre_. The pathetic atonement that in his last days the father soils\nhis bed like a child; hence, also, I am his sick-attendant in the\ndream. Thinking and experiencing are here, as it were; the same thing\nrecalls a highly revolutionary closet drama by Oscar Panizza, in which\nthe Godhead is treated quite contemptuously, as though he were a\nparalytic old man. There occurs a passage: \u201cWill and deed are the same\nthing with him, and he must be prevented by his archangel, a kind of\nGanymede, from scolding and swearing, because these curses would\nimmediately be fulfilled.\u201d Making plans is a reproach against my\nfather, dating from a later period in the development of my critical\nfaculty; just as the whole rebellious, sovereign-offending dream, with\nits scoff at high authority, originates in a revolt against my father.\nThe sovereign is called father of the land (_Landesvater_), and the\nfather is the oldest, first and only authority for the child, from the\nabsolutism of which the other social authorities have developed in the\ncourse of the history of human civilisation (in so far as the\n\u201cmother\u2019s right\u201d does not force a qualification of this thesis). The\nidea in the dream, \u201cthinking and experiencing are the same thing,\u201d\nrefers to the explanation of hysterical symptoms, to which the male\nurinal (glass) also has a relation. I need not explain the principle\nof the \u201cGschnas\u201d to a Viennese; it consists in constructing objects of\nrare and costly appearance out of trifles, and preferably out of\ncomical and worthless material\u2014for example, making suits of armour out\nof cooking utensils, sticks and \u201csalzstangeln\u201d (elongated rolls), as\nour artists like to do at their jolly parties. I had now learned that\nhysterical subjects do the same thing; besides what has actually\noccurred to them, they unconsciously conceive horrible or extravagant\nfantastic images, which they construct from the most harmless and\ncommonplace things they have experienced. The symptoms depend solely\nupon these phantasies, not upon the memory of their real experiences,\nbe they serious or harmless. This explanation helped me to overcome\nmany difficulties and gave me much pleasure. I was able to allude to\nit in the dream element \u201cmale urinal\u201d (glass) because I had been told\nthat at the last \u201cGschnas\u201d evening a poison chalice of Lucretia Borgia\nhad been exhibited, the chief constituent of which had consisted of a\nglass urinal for men, such as is used in hospitals.\nFootnote BP:\n_Cf._ the passage in Griesinger[31] and the remarks in my second essay\non the \u201cdefence-neuropsychoses\u201d\u2014_Selected Papers on Hysteria_,\ntranslated by A. A. Brill.\nFootnote BQ:\nIn the two sources from which I am acquainted with this dream, the\nreport of its contents do not agree.\nFootnote BR:\nAn exception is furnished by those cases in which the dreamer utilises\nin the expression of his latent dream thoughts the symbols which are\nfamiliar to us.\nFootnote BS:\n\u201cThe Emperor\u2019s New Clothes.\u201d\nFootnote BT:\nThe child also appears in the fairy tale, for there a child suddenly\ncalls: \u201cWhy, he hasn\u2019t anything on at all.\u201d\nFootnote BU:\nFerenczi has reported a number of interesting dreams of nakedness in\nwomen which could be traced to an infantile desire to exhibit, but\nwhich differ in some features from the \u201ctypical\u201d dream of nakedness\ndiscussed above.\nFootnote BV:\nFor obvious reasons the presence of the \u201cwhole family\u201d in the dream\nhas the same significance.\nFootnote BW:\nA supplementary interpretation of this dream: To spit on the stairs,\nled me to \u201cesprit d\u2019escalier\u201d by a free translation, owing to the fact\nthat \u201cSpucken\u201d (English: spit, and also to act like a _spook_, to\nhaunt) is an occupation of ghosts. \u201cStair-wit\u201d is equivalent to lack\nof quickness at repartee (German: _Schlagfertigkeit_\u2014readiness to hit\nback, to strike), with which I must really reproach myself. Is it a\nquestion, however, whether the nurse was lacking in \u201creadiness to\nhit\u201d?\nFootnote BX:\n_Cf._ \u201cAnalyse der Phobie eines f\u00fcnfj\u00e4hrigen Knaben\u201d in the _Jahrbuch\nf\u00fcr psychoanalytische und psychopathologische Forschungen_, vol. i.,\n1909, and \u201cUeber infantile Sexualtheorien,\u201d in _Sexualprobleme_, vol.\ni., 1908.\nFootnote BY:\nThe three-and-a-half-year-old Hans, whose phobia is the subject of\nanalysis in the above-mentioned publication, cries during fever\nshortly after the birth of his sister: \u201cI don\u2019t want a little sister.\u201d\nIn his neurosis, one and a half years later, he frankly confesses the\nwish that the mother should drop the little one into the bath-tub\nwhile bathing it, in order that it may die. With all this, Hans is a\ngood-natured, affectionate child, who soon becomes fond of his sister,\nand likes especially to take her under his protection.\nFootnote BZ:\nThe three-and-a-half-year old Hans embodies his crushing criticism of\nhis little sister in the identical word (see previous notes). He\nassumes that she is unable to speak on account of her lack of teeth.\nFootnote CA:\nI heard the following idea expressed by a gifted boy of ten, after the\nsudden death of his father: \u201cI understand that father is dead, but I\ncannot see why he does not come home for supper.\u201d\nFootnote CB:\nAt least a certain number of mythological representations. According\nto others, emasculation is only practised by Kronos on his father.\nWith regard to mythological significance of this motive, _cf._ Otto\nRank\u2019s \u201cDer Mythus von der Geburt des Helden,\u201d fifth number of\n_Schriften zur angew. Seelenkunde_, 1909.\nFootnote CC:\nAct. i. sc. 2. Translated by George Somers Clark.\nFootnote CD:\nAnother of the great creations of tragic poetry, Shakespeare\u2019s\n_Hamlet_, is founded on the same basis as the _Oedipus_. But the whole\ndifference in the psychic life of the two widely separated periods of\ncivilisation\u2014the age-long progress of repression in the emotional life\nof humanity\u2014is made manifest in the changed treatment of the identical\nmaterial. In _Oedipus_ the basic wish-phantasy of the child is brought\nto light and realised as it is in the dream; in _Hamlet_ it remains\nrepressed, and we learn of its existence\u2014somewhat as in the case of a\nneurosis\u2014only by the inhibition which results from it. The fact that\nit is possible to remain in complete darkness concerning the character\nof the hero, has curiously shown itself to be consistent with the\noverpowering effect of the modern drama. The play is based upon\nHamlet\u2019s hesitation to accomplish the avenging task which has been\nassigned to him; the text does not avow the reasons or motives of this\nhesitation, nor have the numerous attempts at interpretation succeeded\nin giving them. According to the conception which is still current\nto-day, and which goes back to Goethe, Hamlet represents the type of\nman whose prime energy is paralysed by over-development of thought\nactivity. (\u201cSicklied o\u2019er with the pale cast of thought.\u201d) According\nto others the poet has attempted to portray a morbid, vacillating\ncharacter who is subject to neurasthenia. The plot of the story,\nhowever, teaches us that Hamlet is by no means intended to appear as a\nperson altogether incapable of action. Twice we see him asserting\nhimself actively, once in headlong passion, where he stabs the\neavesdropper behind the arras, and on another occasion where he sends\nthe two courtiers to the death which has been intended for\nhimself\u2014doing this deliberately, even craftily, and with all the lack\nof compunction of a prince of the Renaissance. What is it, then, that\nrestrains him in the accomplishment of the task which his father\u2019s\nghost has set before him? Here the explanation offers itself that it\nis the peculiar nature of this task. Hamlet can do everything but take\nvengeance upon the man who has put his father out of the way, and has\ntaken his father\u2019s place with his mother\u2014upon the man who shows him\nthe realisation of his repressed childhood wishes. The loathing which\nought to drive him to revenge is thus replaced in him by\nself-reproaches, by conscientious scruples, which represent to him\nthat he himself is no better than the murderer whom he is to punish. I\nhave thus translated into consciousness what had to remain unconscious\nin the mind of the hero; if some one wishes to call Hamlet a hysteric\nsubject I cannot but recognise it as an inference from my\ninterpretation. The sexual disinclination which Hamlet expresses in\nconversation with Ophelia, coincides very well with this view\u2014it is\nthe same sexual disinclination which was to take possession of the\npoet more and more during the next few years of his life, until the\nclimax of it is expressed in _Timon of Athens_. Of course it can only\nbe the poet\u2019s own psychology with which we are confronted in _Hamlet_;\nfrom a work on Shakespeare by George Brandes (1896), I take the fact\nthat the drama was composed immediately after the death of\nShakespeare\u2019s father\u2014that is to say, in the midst of recent mourning\nfor him\u2014during the revival, we may assume, of his childhood emotion\ntowards his father. It is also known that a son of Shakespeare\u2019s, who\ndied early, bore the name of Hamnet (identical with Hamlet). Just as\n_Hamlet_ treats of the relation of the son to his parents, _Macbeth_,\nwhich appears subsequently, is based upon the theme of childlessness.\nJust as every neurotic symptom, just as the dream itself, is capable\nof re-interpretation, and even requires it in order to be perfectly\nintelligible, so every genuine poetical creation must have proceeded\nfrom more than one motive, more than one impulse in the mind of the\npoet, and must admit of more than one interpretation. I have here\nattempted to interpret only the most profound group of impulses in the\nmind of the creative poet. The conception of the _Hamlet_ problem\ncontained in these remarks has been later confirmed in a detailed work\nbased on many new arguments by Dr. Ernest Jones, of Toronto (Canada).\nThe connection of the _Hamlet_ material with the \u201cMythus von der\nGeburt des Helden\u201d has also been demonstrated by O. Rank.\u2014\u201cThe\n_Oedipus_ Complex as an Explanation of _Hamlet\u2019s_ Mystery: a Study in\nMotive\u201d (_American Journal of Psychology_, January 1910, vol. xxi.).\nFootnote CE:\nLikewise, anything large, over-abundant, enormous, and exaggerated,\nmay be a childish characteristic. The child knows no more intense wish\nthan to become big, and to receive as much of everything as grown-ups;\nthe child is hard to satisfy; it knows no _enough_, and insatiably\ndemands the repetition of whatever has pleased it or tasted good to\nit. It learns to practise moderation, to be modest and resigned, only\nthrough culture and education. As is well known, the neurotic is also\ninclined toward immoderation and excess.\nFootnote CF:\nWhile Dr. Jones was delivering a lecture before an American scientific\nsociety, and speaking of egotism in dreams, a learned lady took\nexception to this unscientific generalisation. She thought that the\nlecturer could only pronounce such judgment on the dreams of\nAustrians, and had no right to include the dreams of Americans. As for\nherself she was sure that all her dreams were strictly altruistic.\nFootnote CG:\nAccording to C. G. Jung, dreams of dental irritation in the case of\nwomen have the significance of parturition dreams.\nFootnote CH:\n_Cf._ the \u201cbiographic\u201d dream on p. 235.\nFootnote CI:\nAs the dreams of pulling teeth, and teeth falling out, are interpreted\nin popular belief to mean the death of a close friend, and as\npsychoanalysis can at most only admit of such a meaning in the above\nindicated parodical sense, I insert here a dream of dental irritation\nplaced at my disposal by Otto Rank[109].\nUpon the subject of dreams of dental irritation I have received the\nfollowing report from a colleague who has for some time taken a lively\ninterest in the problems of dream interpretation:\n_I recently dreamed that I went to the dentist who drilled out one of\nmy back teeth in the lower jaw. He worked so long at it that the tooth\nbecame useless. He then grasped it with the forceps, and pulled it out\nwith such perfect ease that it astonished me. He said that I should\nnot care about it, as this was not really the tooth that had been\ntreated; and he put it on the table where the tooth (as it seems to me\nnow an upper incisor) fell apart into many strata. I arose from the\noperating chair, stepped inquisitively nearer, and, full of interest,\nput a medical question. While the doctor separated the individual\npieces of the strikingly white tooth and ground them up (pulverised\nthem) with an instrument, he explained to me that this had some\nconnection with puberty, and that the teeth come out so easily only\nbefore puberty; the decisive moment for this in women is the birth of\na child. I then noticed (as I believe half awake) that this dream was\naccompanied by a pollution which I cannot however definitely place at\na particular point in the dream; I am inclined to think that it began\nwith the pulling out of the tooth._\n_I then continued to dream something which I can no longer remember,\nwhich ended with the fact that I had left my hat and coat somewhere\n(perhaps at the dentist\u2019s), hoping that they would be brought after\nme, and dressed only in my overcoat I hastened to catch a departing\ntrain. I succeeded at the last moment in jumping upon the last car,\nwhere someone was already standing. I could not, however, get inside\nthe car, but was compelled to make the journey in an uncomfortable\nposition, from which I attempted to escape with final success. We\njourneyed through a long tunnel, in which two trains from the opposite\ndirection passed through our own train as if it were a tunnel. I\nlooked in as from the outside through a car window._\nAs material for the interpretation of this dream, we obtained the\nfollowing experiences and thoughts of the dreamer:\u2014\nI. For a short time I had actually been under dental treatment, and at\nthe time of the dream I was suffering from continual pains in the\ntooth of my lower jaw, which was drilled out in the dream, and on\nwhich the dentist had in fact worked longer than I liked. On the\nforenoon of the day of the dream I had again gone to the doctor\u2019s on\naccount of the pain, and he had suggested that I should allow him to\npull out another tooth than the one treated in the same jaw, from\nwhich the pain probably came. It was a \u2018wisdom tooth\u2019 which was just\nbreaking through. On this occasion, and in this connection, I had put\na question to his conscience as a physician.\nII. On the afternoon of the same day I was obliged to excuse myself to\na lady for my irritable disposition on account of the toothache, upon\nwhich she told me that she was afraid to have one of her roots pulled,\nthough the crown was almost completely gone. She thought that the\npulling out of eye teeth was especially painful and dangerous,\nalthough some acquaintance had told her that this was much easier when\nit was a tooth of the lower jaw. It was such a tooth in her case. The\nsame acquaintance also told her that while under an an\u00e6sthetic one of\nher false teeth had been pulled\u2014a statement which increased her fear\nof the necessary operation. She then asked me whether by eye teeth one\nwas to understand molars or canines, and what was known about them. I\nthen called her attention to the vein of superstitions in all these\nmeanings, without however, emphasising the real significance of some\nof the popular views. She knew from her own experience, a very old and\ngeneral popular belief, according to which _if a pregnant woman has\ntoothache she will give birth to a boy_.\nIII. This saying interested me in its relation to the typical\nsignificance of dreams of dental irritation as a substitute for\nonanism as maintained by Freud in his _Traumdeutung_ (2nd edition, p.\n193), for the teeth and the male genital (Bub-boy) are brought in\ncertain relations even in the popular saying. On the evening of the\nsame day I therefore read the passage in question in the\n_Traumdeutung_, and found there among other things the statements\nwhich will be quoted in a moment, the influence of which on my dream\nis as plainly recognisable as the influence of the two above-mentioned\nexperiences. Freud writes concerning dreams of dental irritation that\n\u2018in the case of men nothing else than cravings for masturbation from\nthe time of puberty furnishes the motive power for these dreams,\u2019 p.\n193. Further, \u2018I am of the opinion that the frequent modifications of\nthe typical dream of dental irritation\u2014that _e.g._ of another person\ndrawing the tooth from the dreamer\u2019s mouth\u2014are made intelligible by\nmeans of the same explanation. It may seem problematic, however, how\n\u201cdental irritation\u201d can arrive at this significance. I here call\nattention to the transference from below to above (in the dream in\nquestion from the lower to the upper jaw), which occurs so frequently,\nwhich is at the service of sexual repression, and by means of which\nall kinds of sensations and intentions occurring in hysteria which\nought to be enacted in the genitals can be realised upon less\nobjectionable parts of the body,\u2019 p. 194. \u2018But I must also refer to\nanother connection contained in an idiomatic expression. In our\ncountry there is in use an indelicate designation for the act of\nmasturbation, namely: To pull one out, or to pull one down,\u2019 p. 195,\n2nd edition. This expression had been familiar to me in early youth as\na designation for onanism, and from here on it will not be difficult\nfor the experienced dream interpreter to get access to the infantile\nmaterial which may lie at the basis of this dream. I only wish to add\nthat the facility with which the tooth in the dream came out, and the\nfact that it became transformed after coming out into an upper\nincisor, recalls to me an experience of childhood when I myself easily\nand painlessly pulled out one of my wobbling front teeth. This\nepisode, which I can still to this day distinctly remember with all\nits details, happened at the same early period in which my first\nconscious attempts at onanism began\u2014(Concealing Memory). The reference\nof Freud to an assertion of C. G. Jung that dreams of dental\nirritation in women signify parturition (footnote p. 194), together\nwith the popular belief in the significance of toothache in pregnant\nwomen, has established an opposition between the feminine significance\nand the masculine (puberty). In this connection I recall an earlier\ndream which I dreamed soon after I was discharged by the dentist after\nthe treatment, that the gold crowns which had just been put in fell\nout, whereupon I was greatly chagrined in the dream on account of the\nconsiderable expense, concerning which I had not yet stopped worrying.\nIn view of a certain experience this dream now becomes comprehensible\nas a commendation of the material advantages of masturbation when\ncontrasted with every form of the economically less advantageous\nobject-love (gold crowns are also Austrian gold coins).\nTheoretically this case seems to show a double interest. First it\nverifies the connection revealed by Freud, inasmuch as the ejaculation\nin the dream takes place during the act of tooth-pulling. For no\nmatter in what form a pollution may appear, we are obliged to look\nupon it as a masturbatic gratification which takes place without the\nhelp of mechanical excitation. Moreover the gratification by pollution\nin this case does not take place, as is usually the case, through an\nimaginary object, but it is without an object; and, if one may be\nallowed to say so, it is purely autoerotic, or at most it perhaps\nshows a slight homosexual thread (the dentist).\nThe second point which seems to be worth mentioning is the following:\nThe objection is quite obvious that we are seeking here to validate\nthe Freudian conception in a quite superfluous manner, for the\nexperiences of the reading itself are perfectly sufficient to explain\nto us the content of the dream. The visit to the dentist, the\nconversation with the lady, and the reading of the _Traumdeutung_ are\nsufficient to explain why the sleeper, who was also disturbed during\nthe night by toothache, should dream this dream, it may even explain\nthe removal of the sleep-disturbing pain (by means of the presentation\nof the removal of the painful tooth and simultaneous over-accentuation\nof the dreaded painful sensation through libido). But no matter how\nmuch of this assumption we may admit, we cannot earnestly maintain\nthat the readings of Freud\u2019s explanations have produced in the dreamer\nthe connection of the tooth-pulling with the act of masturbation; it\ncould not even have been made effective had it not been for the fact,\nas the dreamer himself admitted (\u2018to pull one off\u2019) that this\nassociation had already been formed long ago. What may have still more\nstimulated this association in connection with the conversation with\nthe lady is shown by a later assertion of the dreamer that while\nreading the _Traumdeutung_ he could not, for obvious reasons, believe\nin this typical meaning of dreams of dental irritation, and\nentertained the wish to know whether it held true for all dreams of\nthis nature. The dream now confirms this at least for his own person,\nand shows him why he had to doubt it. The dream is therefore also in\nthis respect the fulfilment of a wish; namely, to be convinced of the\nimportance and stability of this conception of Freud.\nFootnote CJ:\nA young colleague, who is entirely free from nervousness, tells me in\nthis connection: \u201cI know from my own experience that while swinging,\nand at the moment at which the downward movement had the greatest\nimpetus, I used to get a curious feeling in my genitals, which I must\ndesignate, although it was not really pleasant to me, as a voluptuous\nfeeling.\u201d I have often heard from patients that their first erections\naccompanied by voluptuous sensations had occurred in boyhood while\nthey were climbing. It is established with complete certainty by\npsychoanalyses that the first sexual impulses have often originated in\nthe scufflings and wrestlings of childhood.\nFootnote CK:\nThis naturally holds true only for German-speaking dreamers who are\nacquainted with the vulgarism \u201c_v\u00f6geln_.\u201d\nFootnote CL:\n_Sammlung kl.

Rank,[108] p. 534);\nthus a dream of sexual relations with the mother has been transmitted\nto us by Julius C\u00e6sar which the oneiroscopists interpreted as a\nfavourable omen for taking possession of the earth (Mother-earth). It\nis also known that the oracle declared to the Tarquinii that that one\nof them would become ruler of Rome who should first kiss the mother\n(_osculum, matri tulerit_), which Brutus conceived as referring to the\nmother-earth (_terram osculo contigit, scilicet quod ea communia mater\nomnium mortalium esset_, Livius, I., lxi.). These myths and\ninterpretations point to a correct psychological knowledge. I have\nfound that persons who consider themselves preferred or favoured by\ntheir mothers manifest in life that confidence in themselves and that\nfirm optimism which often seems heroic and brings about real success\nby force.\nFootnote CQ:\nIt is only of late that I have learned to value the significance of\nfancies and unconscious thoughts about life in the womb. They contain\nthe explanation of the curious fear felt by so many people of being\nburied alive, as well as the profoundest unconscious reason for the\nbelief in a life after death which represents nothing but a projection\ninto the future of this mysterious life before birth. _The act of\nbirth, moreover, is the first experience with fear, and is thus the\nsource and model of the emotion of fear._\nFootnote CR:\nFor such a dream see Pfister: \u201cEin Fall von Psychoanalytischer\nSeelensorge und Seelenheilung,\u201d _Evangelische Freiheit_, 1909.\nConcerning the symbol of \u201csaving\u201d see my lecture, \u201cDie Zuk\u00fcnftigen\nChancen der psychoanalytischen Therapie,\u201d _Zentralblatt f\u00fcr\nPsychoanalyse_, No. I., 1910.

He stated that his most frequent dream was of\nclimbing a stairway, and that there was surely nothing sexual behind\nthis. Our attention having been called to this objection, we directed\nour investigations to the occurrence of stairways, stairs, and ladders\nin the dream, and we soon ascertained that stairs (or anything\nanalogous to them) represent a definite symbol of coitus. The basis\nfor this comparison is not difficult to find; under rhythmic intervals\nand with increasing difficulty in breathing one reaches to a height,\nand may come down again in a few rapid jumps. Thus the rhythm of\ncoitus is recognisable in climbing stairs. Let us not forget to\nconsider the usage of language. It shows us that the \u201cclimbing\u201d or\n\u201cmounting\u201d is, without further addition, used as a substitutive\ndesignation of the sexual act. In French the step of the stairway is\ncalled \u201c_la marche_\u201d; \u201c_un vieux marcheur_\u201d corresponds exactly to our\n\u201can old climber.\u201d\u201d\nFootnote CV:\nIn this country where the word \u201cnecktie\u201d is almost exclusively used,\nthe translator has also found it to be a symbol of a burdensome woman\nfrom whom the dreamer longs to be freed\u2014\u201cnecktie\u2014something tied to my\nneck like a heavy weight\u2014my fianc\u00e9e,\u201d are the associations from the\ndream of a man who eventually broke his marriage engagement.\nFootnote CW:\nIn spite of all the differences between Scherner\u2019s conception of dream\nsymbolism and the one developed here, I must still assert that\nScherner[58] should be recognised as the true discoverer of symbolism\nin dreams, and that the experience of psychoanalysis has brought his\nbook into honourable repute after it had been considered fantastic for\nabout fifty years.\nFootnote CX:\nFrom \u201cNachtr\u00e4ge zur Traumdeutung,\u201d _Zentralblatt f\u00fcr Psychoanalyse_,\nI., No. 5 and 6, 1911.\nFootnote CY:\n\u201cBeitr\u00e4ge zur Traumdeutung,\u201d _Jahrbuch f\u00fcr Psychoanalyt. und psychop.\nForsch._, Bd.

You go to a field where\nsilver-berries are growing and pick them; then the berries are\neliminated and the silver remains in a free state.\u201d The first person\nwho read and criticised this book made the objection to me\u2014which other\nreaders will probably repeat\u2014\u201cthat the dreamer often appears too\nwitty.\u201d That is true, as long as it applies to the dreamer; it\ninvolves a condemnation only when its application is extended to the\ninterpreter of the dream. In waking reality I can make very little\nclaim to the predicate \u201cwitty\u201d; if my dreams appear witty, this is not\nthe fault of my individuality, but of the peculiar psychological\nconditions under which the dream is fabricated, and is intimately\nconnected with the theory of wit and the comical. The dream becomes\nwitty because the shortest and most direct way to the expression of\nits thoughts is barred for it: the dream is under constraint. My\nreaders may convince themselves that the dreams of my patients give\nthe impression of being witty (attempting to be witty), in the same\ndegree and in a greater than my own. Nevertheless this reproach\nimpelled me to compare the technique of wit with the dream activity,\nwhich I have done in a book published in 1905, on _Wit and its\nRelation to the Unconscious_. (Author.)\nFootnote DP:\nLasker died of progressive paralysis, that is of the consequences of\nan infection caught from a woman (lues); Lasalle, as is well known,\nwas killed in a duel on account of a lady.\nFootnote DQ:\nIn the case of a young man who was suffering from obsessions, but\nwhose intellectual functions were intact and highly developed, I\nrecently found the only exception to this rule. The speeches which\noccurred in his dreams did not originate in speeches which he had\nheard or had made himself, but corresponded to the undisfigured\nwording of his obsessive thoughts, which only came to his\nconsciousness in a changed state while he was awake.\nFootnote DR:\nPsychic intensity, value, and emphasis due to the interest of an idea\nare, of course, to be kept distinct from sensational intensity, and\nfrom intensity of that which is conceived.\nFootnote DS:\nSince I consider this reference of dream disfigurement to the censor\nas the essence of my dream theory, I here insert the latter portion of\na story \u201cTraumen wie Wachen\u201d from _Phantasien eines Realisten_, by\nLynkus, Vienna, (second edition, 1900), in which I find this chief\nfeature of my theory reproduced:\u2014\n\u201cConcerning a man who possesses the remarkable quality of never\ndreaming nonsense....\u201d\n\u201cYour marvellous characteristic of dreaming as you wake is based upon\nyour virtues, upon your goodness, your justice, and your love for\ntruth; it is the moral clearness of your nature which makes everything\nabout you intelligible.\u201d\n\u201cBut if you think the matter over carefully,\u201d replied the other, \u201cI\nalmost believe that all people are created as I am, and that no human\nbeing ever dreams nonsense! A dream which is so distinctly remembered\nthat it can be reproduced, which is therefore no dream of delirium,\n_always_ has a meaning; why, it cannot be otherwise! For that which is\nin contradiction with itself can never be grouped together as a whole.\nThe fact that time and space are often thoroughly shaken up detracts\nnothing from the real meaning of the dream, because neither of them\nhas had any significance whatever for its essential contents. We often\ndo the same thing in waking life; think of the fairy-tale, of many\ndaring and profound phantastic creations, about which only an ignorant\nperson would say: \u2018That is nonsense! For it is impossible.\u2019\u201d\n\u201cIf it were only always possible to interpret dreams correctly, as you\nhave just done with mine!\u201d said the friend.\n\u201cThat is certainly not an easy task, but the dreamer himself ought\nalways to succeed in doing it with a little concentration of\nattention.... You ask why it is generally impossible? Your dreams seem\nto conceal something secret, something unchaste of a peculiar and\nhigher nature, a certain mystery in your nature which cannot easily be\nrevealed by thought; and it is for that reason that your dreaming\nseems so often to be without meaning, or even to be a contradiction.\nBut in the profoundest sense this is by no means the case; indeed it\ncannot be true at all, for it is always the same person, whether he is\nasleep or awake.\u201d\nFootnote DT:\nI have since given the complete analysis and synthesis of two dreams\nin the _Bruchstueck einer Hysterieanalyse_, 1905.\nFootnote DU:\nFrom a work of K. Abel, _Der Gegensinn der Urworte_, 1884 (see my\nreview of it in the Bleuler-Freud _Jahrbuch_, II., 1910), I learned\nwith surprise a fact which is confirmed by other philologists, that\nthe oldest languages behaved in this regard quite like the dream. They\noriginally had only one word for both extremes in a series of\nqualities or activities (strong\u2014weak, old\u2014young, far\u2014near, to tie\u2014to\nseparate), and formed separate designations for the two extremes only\nsecondarily through slight modifications of the common primitive word.\nAbel demonstrated these relationships with rare exceptions in the old\nEgyptian, and he was able to show distinct remnants of the same\ndevelopment in the Semitic and Indo-Germanic languages.\nFootnote DV:\nIf I do not know behind which of the persons which occur in the dream\nI am to look for my ego, I observe the following rule: That person in\nthe dream who is subject to an emotion which I experience while\nasleep, is the one that conceals my ego.\nFootnote DW:\nThe hysterical attack sometimes uses the same device\u2014the inversion of\ntime-relations\u2014for the purpose of concealing its meaning from the\nspectator. The attack of a hysterical girl, for example, consists in\nenacting a little romance, which she has unconsciously fancied in\nconnection with an encounter in the street car. A man, attracted by\nthe beauty of her foot, addresses her while she is reading, whereupon\nshe goes with him and experiences a stormy love scene. Her attack\nbegins with the representation of this scene in writhing movements of\nthe body (accompanied by motions of the lips to signify kissing,\nentwining of the arms for embraces), whereupon she hurries into\nanother room, sits down in a chair, lifts her skirt in order to show\nher foot, acts as though she were about to read a book, and speaks to\nme (answers me).\nFootnote DX:\nAccompanying hysterical symptoms: Failure to menstruate and profound\ndepression, which was the chief ailment of the patient.\nFootnote DY:\nA reference to a childhood experience is after complete analysis shown\nto exist by the following intermediaries: \u201cThe Moor has done his duty,\nthe Moor _may go_.\u201d And then follows the waggish question: \u201cHow old is\nthe Moor when he has done his duty? One year. Then he may go.\u201d (It is\nsaid that I came into the world with so much black curly hair that my\nyoung mother declared me to be a Moor.) The circumstance that I do not\nfind my hat is an experience of the day which has been turned to\naccount with various significations. Our servant, who is a genius at\nstowing away things, had hidden the hat. A suppression of sad thoughts\nabout death is also concealed behind the conclusion of the dream: \u201cI\nhave not nearly done my duty yet; I may not go yet.\u201d Birth and death,\nas in the dream that occurred shortly before about Goethe and the\nparalytic (p. 345).\nFootnote DZ:\nCf. _Der Witz und seine Beziehung zum Unbewussten_, 2nd edit. 1912,\nand \u201cword-bridges,\u201d in the solutions of neurotic symptoms.\nFootnote EA:\nIn general it is doubtful in the interpretation of every element of\nthe dream whether it\u2014\n(_a_) is to be regarded as having a negative or a positive sense\n(relation of opposition);\n(_b_) is to be interpreted historically (as a reminiscence);\n(_c_) is symbolic; or whether\n(_d_) its valuation is to be based upon the sound of its verbal\nexpression.\nIn spite of this manifold signification, it may be said that the\nrepresentation of the dream activity does not impose upon the\ntranslator any greater difficulties than the ancient writers of\nhieroglyphics imposed upon their readers.\nFootnote EB:\nFor the interpretation of this preliminary dream, which is to be\nregarded as \u201ccasual,\u201d see p. 292.\nFootnote EC:\nHer career.\nFootnote ED:\nHigh birth, the wish contrast to the preliminary dream.\nFootnote EE:\nA composite image, which unites two localities, the so-called garret\n(German _Boden_\u2014floor, garret) of her father\u2019s house, in which she\nplayed with her brother, the object of her later fancies, and the\ngarden of a malicious uncle, who used to tease her.\nFootnote EF:\nWish contrast to an actual memory of her uncle\u2019s garden, to the effect\nthat she used to expose herself while she was asleep.\nFootnote EG:\nJust as the angel bears a lily stem in the Annunciation.\nFootnote EH:\nFor the explanation of this composite image, see p. 296; innocence,\nmenstruation, Camille.\nFootnote EI:\nReferring to the plurality of the persons who serve the purpose of her\nfancy.\nFootnote EJ:\nWhether it is permitted to \u201cpull one off,\u201d _i.e._ to masturbate.\nFootnote EK:\nThe bough has long since been used to represent the male genital, and\nbesides that it contains a very distinct allusion to the family name\nof the dreamer.\nFootnote EL:\nRefers to matrimonial precautions, as does that which follows.\nFootnote EM:\nAn analogous \u201cbiographical\u201d dream was reported on p. 252, as the third\nof the examples of dream symbolism; a second example is the one fully\nreported by Rank[106] under the title \u201cTraum der sich selbst deutet\u201d;\nfor another one which must be read in the \u201copposite direction,\u201d see\nStekel[114], p. 486.\nFootnote EN:\nGiven by translator as author\u2019s example could not be translated.\nFootnote EO:\nThe neurosis also proceeds in the same manner. I know a patient who\ninvoluntarily\u2014contrary to her own wishes\u2014hears (hallucinatory) songs\nor fragments of songs without being able to understand their meaning\nto her psychic life. She is surely not a paranoiac. Analysis showed\nthat she wrongly utilised the text of these songs by means of a\ncertain license. \u201cOh thou blissful one, Oh thou happy one,\u201d is the\nbeginning of a Christmas song. By not continuing it to the word\n\u201cChristmas time\u201d she makes a bridal song out of it, &c. The same\nmechanism of disfigurement may take place also without hallucinations\nas a mere mental occurrence.\nFootnote EP:\nAs a contribution to the over-determination: My excuse for coming late\nwas that after working late at night I had in the morning to make the\nlong journey from Kaiser Josef Street to Waehringer Street.\nFootnote EQ:\nIn addition C\u00e6sar\u2014Kaiser.\nFootnote ER:\nI have forgotten in what author I found a dream mentioned that was\noverrun with unusually small figures, the source of which turned out\nto be one of the engravings of Jacques Callot, which the dreamer had\nlooked at during the day. These engravings contained an enormous\nnumber of very small figures; a series of them treats of the horrors\nof the Thirty Years\u2019 War.\nFootnote ES:\nThe frequency with which in the dream dead persons appear as living,\nact, and deal with us, has called forth undue astonishment and given\nrise to strange explanations, from which our ignorance of the dream\nbecomes strikingly evident. And yet the explanation for these dreams\nlies very close at hand. How often we have occasion to think: \u201c_If_\nfather were still alive, what would he say to it?\u201d The dream can\nexpress this _if_ in no other way than by present time in a definite\nsituation. Thus, for instance, a young man, whose grandfather has left\nhim a great inheritance, dreams that his grandfather is alive and\ndemands an accounting of him, upon an occasion when the young man had\nbeen reproached for making too great an expenditure of money. What we\nconsider a resistance to the dream\u2014the objection made by our better\nknowledge, that after all the man is already dead\u2014is in reality a\nconsolation, because the dead person did not have this or that\nexperience, or satisfaction at the knowledge that he has nothing more\nto say.\nAnother form of absurdity found in dreams of deceased relatives does\nnot express folly and absurdity, but serves to represent the most\nextreme rejection; as the representation of a repressed thought which\none would gladly have appear as something least thought of. Dreams of\nthis kind are only solvable if one recalls that the dream makes no\ndistinction between things desired and realities. Thus, for example, a\nman who nursed his father during his sickness, and who felt his death\nvery keenly, sometime afterward dreamed the following senseless dream:\n_The father was again living, and conversed with him as usual, but_\n(the remarkable thing about it) _he had nevertheless died, though he\ndid not know it_. This dream can be understood if after \u201che had\nnevertheless died,\u201d one inserts _in consequence of the dreamer\u2019s wish,\nand_ if after \u201cbut he did not know it\u201d one adds _that the dreamer has\nentertained this wish_. While nursing his father, the son often wishes\nhis father\u2019s death; _i.e._ he entertained the really compassionate\ndesire that death finally put an end to his suffering. While mourning\nafter his death, this very wish of compassion became an unconscious\nreproach, as if it had really contributed to shorten the life of the\nsick man. Through the awakening of early infantile feelings against\nthe father, it became possible to express this reproach as a dream;\nand it was just because of the world-wide contrast between the dream\ninciter and day thought that this dream had to come out so absurdly\n(_cf._ with this, \u201cFormulierungen \u00fcber die zwei Prinzipien des\nseelischen Geschehens,\u201d _Jahrbuch_, Bleuler-Freud, III, 1, 1911).\nFootnote ET:\nHere the dream activity parodies the thought which it designates as\nridiculous, in that it creates something ridiculous in relation to it.\nHeine does something similar when he tries to mock the bad rhymes of\nthe King of Bavaria. He does it in still worse rhymes:\n\u201cHerr Ludwig ist ein grosser Poet\nUnd singt er, so stuerzt Apollo\nVor ihm auf die Knie und bittet und fleht,\n\u2018Halt ein, ich werde sonst toll oh!\u2019\u201d\nFootnote EU:\nNote the resemblance of _Geseres_ and _Ungeseres_ to the German words\nfor salted and unsalted\u2014_gesalzen_ and _ungesalzen_; also to the\nGerman words for soured and unsoured\u2014_gesauert_ and _ungesauert_.\n(Translator.)\nFootnote EV:\nThis dream also furnishes a good example for the general thesis that\ndreams of the same night, even though they be separated in memory,\nspring from the same thought material. The dream situation in which I\nam rescuing my children from the city of Rome, moreover, is disfigured\nby a reference to an episode belonging to my childhood. The meaning is\nthat I envy certain relatives who years ago had occasion to transplant\ntheir children to another soil.\nFootnote EW:\nThis German expression is equivalent to our saying \u201cYou are not\nresponsible for that,\u201d or \u201cThat has not been acquired through your own\nefforts.\u201d (Translator.)\nFootnote EX:\nThe injunction or purpose contained in the dream, \u201cI must tell that to\nthe doctor,\u201d which occurs in dreams that are dreamed in the course of\npsychoanalytical treatment, regularly corresponds to a great\nresistance to the confession involved in the dream, and is not\ninfrequently followed by forgetting of the dream.\nFootnote EY:\nA subject about which an extensive discussion has taken place in the\nvolumes of the _Revue Philosophique_\u2014(Paramnesia in the Dream).\nFootnote EZ:\nThese results correct in several respects my earlier statements\nconcerning the representation of logical relations (p. 290). The\nlatter described the general conditions of dream activity, but they\ndid not take into consideration its finest and most careful\nperformances.\nFootnote FA:\nStanniol, allusion to _Stannius_, the nervous system of fishes; _cf._\np. 325.\nFootnote FB:\nThe place in the corridor of my apartment house where the baby\ncarriages of the other tenants stand; it is also otherwise several\ntimes over-determined.\nFootnote FC:\nThis description is not intelligible even to myself, but I follow the\nprinciple of reproducing the dream in those words which occur to me\nwhile I am writing it down. The wording itself is a part of the dream\nrepresentation.\nFootnote FD:\nSchiller was not born in one of the Marburgs, but in Marbach, as every\ngraduate of a Gymnasium knows, and as I also knew. This again is one\nof those errors (_cf._ p. 165) which are included as substitutes for\nan intended deception at another place\u2014an explanation of which I have\nattempted in the _Psychopathologie des Alltagslebens_.\nFootnote FE:\nAs analogy to this, I have since explained the extraordinary effect of\npleasure produced by \u201ctendency\u201d wit.\nFootnote FF:\nIt is this fancy from the unconscious dream thoughts which\nperemptorily demands _non vivit_ instead of _non vixit_. \u201cYou have\ncome too late, he is no longer alive.\u201d The fact that the manifest\nsituation also tends towards \u201cnon vivit\u201d has been mentioned on page\n334.\nFootnote FG:\nIt is striking that the name Joseph plays such a large part in my\ndreams (see the dream about my uncle). I can hide my ego in the dream\nbehind persons of this name with particular ease, for Joseph was the\nname of the _dream interpreter_ in the Bible.\nFootnote FH:\nR\u00eave, petit roman\u2014day-dream, story.\nFootnote FI:\nI have analysed a good example of a dream of this kind having its\norigin in the stratification of several phantasies, in the _Bruchst\u00fcck\neiner Hysterie Analyse_, 1905. Moreover I undervalued the significance\nof such phantasies for dream formation, as long as I was working\nchiefly with my own dreams, which were based rarely upon day dreams,\nmost frequently upon discussions and mental conflicts. With other\npersons it is often much easier to prove the _full analogy between the\nnocturnal dream and the day dream_. It is often possible in an\nhysterical patient to replace an attack by a dream; it is then obvious\nthat the phantasy of day dreams is the first step for both psychic\nformations.\nFootnote FJ:\nSee the _Psychopathology of Everyday Life_, 4th ed., 1912. (English\ntranslation in preparation.)\nFootnote FK:\nConcerning the object of forgetting in general, see the\n_Psychopathology of Everyday Life_.\nFootnote FL:\nTranslated by A. A. Brill, appearing under the title _Selected Papers\non Hysteria_.\nFootnote FM:\nJung has brilliantly corroborated this statement by analyses of\nDementia Praecox. (_The Psychology of Dementia Praecox_, translated by\nF. Peterson and A. A. Brill.)\nFootnote FN:\nThe same considerations naturally hold true also for the case where\nsuperficial associations are exposed in the dream, as, _e.g._, in both\ndreams reported by Maury (p. 50, _p\u00e9lerinage_\u2014_pelletier_\u2014_pelle_,\n_kilometer_\u2014_kilogram_\u2014_gilolo_, _Lobelia_\u2014_Lopez_\u2014_Lotto_). I know\nfrom my work with neurotics what kind of reminiscence preferentially\nrepresents itself in this manner. It is the consultation of\nencyclop\u00e6dias by which most people pacify their desire for explanation\nof the sexual riddle during the period of curiosity in puberty.\nFootnote FO:\nThe above sentences, which when written sounded very improbable, have\nsince been justified experimentally by Jung and his pupils in the\n_Diagnostische Assoziationsstudien_.\nFootnote FP:\n_Selected Papers on Hysteria and Other Psychoneuroses_, p. 165,\ntranslated by A. A. Brill (_Journal Mental and Nervous Disease_\nPublishing Co.).\nFootnote FQ:\nThe German word \u201cDutzendmensch\u201d (a man of dozens) which the young lady\nwished to use in order to express her real opinion of her friend\u2019s\nfianc\u00e9, denotes a person with whom figures are everything.\n(Translator.)\nFootnote FR:\nThey share this character of indestructibility with all psychic acts\nthat are really unconscious\u2014that is, with psychic acts belonging to\nthe system of the unconscious only. These paths are constantly open\nand never fall into disuse; they conduct the discharge of the exciting\nprocess as often as it becomes endowed with unconscious excitement. To\nspeak metaphorically they suffer the same form of annihilation as the\nshades of the lower region in the _Odyssey_, who awoke to new life the\nmoment they drank blood. The processes depending on the foreconscious\nsystem are destructible in a different way. The psychotherapy of the\nneuroses is based on this difference.\nFootnote FS:\nLe Lorrain justly extols the wish-fulfilment of the dream: \u201cSans\nfatigue s\u00e9rieuse, sans \u00eatre oblig\u00e9 de recourir \u00e0 cette lutte opini\u00e2tre\net longue qui use et corrode les jouissances poursuivies.\u201d\nFootnote FT:\nThis idea has been borrowed from _The Theory of Sleep_ by Li\u00e9bault,\nwho revived hypnotic investigation in our days. (_Du Sommeil\nprovoqu\u00e9_, etc.; Paris, 1889.)\nFootnote FU:\nThe German of the word _bird_ is \u201cVogel,\u201d which gives origin to the\nvulgar expression \u201cv\u00f6glen,\u201d denoting sexual intercourse. (Trans.\nnote.)\nFootnote FV:\nThe italics are my own, though the meaning is plain enough without\nthem.\nFootnote FW:\nThe italics are mine.\nFootnote FX:\n_Cf._ the significant observations by J. Breuer in our _Studies on\nHysteria_, 1895, and 2nd ed. 1909.\nFootnote FY:\nHere, as in other places, there are gaps in the treatment of the\nsubject, which I have left intentionally, because to fill them up\nwould require on the one hand too great effort, and on the other hand\nan extensive reference to material that is foreign to the dream. Thus\nI have avoided stating whether I connect with the word \u201csuppressed\u201d\nanother sense than with the word \u201crepressed.\u201d It has been made clear\nonly that the latter emphasizes more than the former the relation to\nthe unconscious. I have not entered into the cognate problem why the\ndream thoughts also experience distortion by the censor when they\nabandon the progressive continuation to consciousness and choose the\npath of regression. I have been above all anxious to awaken an\ninterest in the problems to which the further analysis of the\ndream-work leads and to indicate the other themes which meet these on\nthe way. It was not always easy to decide just where the pursuit\nshould be discontinued. That I have not treated exhaustively the part\nplayed in the dream by the psychosexual life and have avoided the\ninterpretation of dreams of an obvious sexual content is due to a\nspecial reason which may not come up to the reader\u2019s expectation. To\nbe sure, it is very far from my ideas and the principles expressed by\nme in neuropathology to regard the sexual life as a \u201cpudendum\u201d which\nshould be left unconsidered by the physician and the scientific\ninvestigator. I also consider ludicrous the moral indignation which\nprompted the translator of Artemidoros of Daldis to keep from the\nreader\u2019s knowledge the chapter on sexual dreams contained in the\n_Symbolism of the Dreams_. As for myself, I have been actuated solely\nby the conviction that in the explanation of sexual dreams I should be\nbound to entangle myself deeply in the still unexplained problems of\nperversion and bisexuality; and for that reason I have reserved this\nmaterial for another connection.\nFootnote FZ:\nThe dream is not the only phenomenon tending to base psychopathology\non psychology.

{"text": "FIRST LECTURE\nINTRODUCTION\nI do not know how familiar some of you may be, either from your reading\nor from hearsay, with psychoanalysis. But, in keeping with the title of\nthese lectures--_A General Introduction to Psychoanalysis_--I am obliged\nto proceed as though you knew nothing about this subject, and stood in\nneed of preliminary instruction.\nTo be sure, this much I may presume that you do know, namely, that\npsychoanalysis is a method of treating nervous patients medically. And\njust at this point I can give you an example to illustrate how the\nprocedure in this field is precisely the reverse of that which is the\nrule in medicine. Usually when we introduce a patient to a medical\ntechnique which is strange to him we minimize its difficulties and give\nhim confident promises concerning the result of the treatment. When,\nhowever, we undertake psychoanalytic treatment with a neurotic patient\nwe proceed differently. We hold before him the difficulties of the\nmethod, its length, the exertions and the sacrifices which it will cost\nhim; and, as to the result, we tell him that we make no definite\npromises, that the result depends on his conduct, on his understanding,\non his adaptability, on his perseverance. We have, of course, excellent\nmotives for conduct which seems so perverse, and into which you will\nperhaps gain insight at a later point in these lectures.\nDo not be offended, therefore, if, for the present, I treat you as I\ntreat these neurotic patients. Frankly, I shall dissuade you from coming\nto hear me a second time. With this intention I shall show what\nimperfections are necessarily involved in the teaching of psychoanalysis\nand what difficulties stand in the way of gaining a personal judgment. I\nshall show you how the whole trend of your previous training and all\nyour accustomed mental habits must unavoidably have made you opponents\nof psychoanalysis, and how much you must overcome in yourselves in\norder to master this instinctive opposition. Of course I cannot predict\nhow much psychoanalytic understanding you will gain from my lectures,\nbut I can promise this, that by listening to them you will not learn how\nto undertake a psychoanalytic treatment or how to carry one to\ncompletion. Furthermore, should I find anyone among you who does not\nfeel satisfied with a cursory acquaintance with psychoanalysis, but who\nwould like to enter into a more enduring relationship with it, I shall\nnot only dissuade him, but I shall actually warn him against it. As\nthings now stand, a person would, by such a choice of profession, ruin\nhis every chance of success at a university, and if he goes out into the\nworld as a practicing physician, he will find himself in a society which\ndoes not understand his aims, which regards him with suspicion and\nhostility, and which turns loose upon him all the malicious spirits\nwhich lurk within it.\nHowever, there are always enough individuals who are interested in\nanything which may be added to the sum total of knowledge, despite such\ninconveniences. Should there be any of this type among you, and should\nthey ignore my dissuasion and return to the next of these lectures, they\nwill be welcome. But all of you have the right to know what these\ndifficulties of psychoanalysis are to which I have alluded.\nFirst of all, we encounter the difficulties inherent in the teaching and\nexposition of psychoanalysis. In your medical instruction you have been\naccustomed to visual demonstration. You see the anatomical specimen, the\nprecipitate in the chemical reaction, the contraction of the muscle as\nthe result of the stimulation of its nerves. Later the patient is\npresented to your senses; the symptoms of his malady, the products of\nthe pathological processes, in many cases even the cause of the disease\nis shown in isolated state. In the surgical department you are made to\nwitness the steps by which one brings relief to the patient, and are\npermitted to attempt to practice them. Even in psychiatry, the\ndemonstration affords you, by the patient's changed facial play, his\nmanner of speech and his behavior, a wealth of observations which leave\nfar-reaching impressions. Thus the medical teacher preponderantly plays\nthe role of a guide and instructor who accompanies you through a museum\nin which you contract an immediate relationship to the exhibits, and in\nwhich you believe yourself to have been convinced through your own\nobservation of the existence of the new things you see.\nUnfortunately, everything is different in psychoanalysis. In\npsychoanalysis nothing occurs but the interchange of words between the\npatient and the physician. The patient talks, tells of his past\nexperiences and present impressions, complains, confesses his wishes and\nemotions. The physician listens, tries to direct the thought processes\nof the patient, reminds him of things, forces his attention into certain\nchannels, gives him explanations and observes the reactions of\nunderstanding or denial which he calls forth in the patient. The\nuneducated relatives of our patients--persons who are impressed only by\nthe visible and tangible, preferably by such procedure as one sees in\nthe moving picture theatres--never miss an opportunity of voicing their\nscepticism as to how one can \"do anything for the malady through mere\ntalk.\" Such thinking, of course, is as shortsighted as it is\ninconsistent. For these are the very persons who know with such\ncertainty that the patients \"merely imagine\" their symptoms. Words were\noriginally magic, and the word retains much of its old magical power\neven to-day. With words one man can make another blessed, or drive him\nto despair; by words the teacher transfers his knowledge to the pupil;\nby words the speaker sweeps his audience with him and determines its\njudgments and decisions. Words call forth effects and are the universal\nmeans of influencing human beings. Therefore let us not underestimate\nthe use of words in psychotherapy, and let us be satisfied if we may be\nauditors of the words which are exchanged between the analyst and his\npatient.\nBut even that is impossible. The conversation of which the\npsychoanalytic treatment consists brooks no auditor, it cannot be\ndemonstrated. One can, of course, present a neurasthenic or hysteric to\nthe students in a psychiatric lecture. He tells of his complaints and\nsymptoms, but of nothing else. The communications which are necessary\nfor the analysis are made only under the conditions of a special\naffective relationship to the physician; the patient would become dumb\nas soon as he became aware of a single impartial witness. For these\ncommunications concern the most intimate part of his psychic life,\neverything which as a socially independent person he must conceal from\nothers; these communications deal with everything which, as a harmonious\npersonality, he will not admit even to himself.\nYou cannot, therefore, \"listen in\" on a psychoanalytic treatment. You\ncan only hear of it. You will get to know psychoanalysis, in the\nstrictest sense of the word, only by hearsay. Such instruction even at\nsecond hand, will place you in quite an unusual position for forming a\njudgment. For it is obvious that everything depends on the faith you are\nable to put in the instructor.\nImagine that you are not attending a psychiatric, but an historical\nlecture, and that the lecturer is telling you about the life and martial\ndeeds of Alexander the Great. What would be your reasons for believing\nin the authenticity of his statements? At first sight, the condition of\naffairs seems even more unfavorable than in the case of psychoanalysis,\nfor the history professor was as little a participant in Alexander's\ncampaigns as you were; the psychoanalyst at least tells you of things in\nconnection with which he himself has played some role. But then the\nquestion turns on this--what set of facts can the historian marshal in\nsupport of his position? He can refer you to the accounts of ancient\nauthors, who were either contemporaries themselves, or who were at least\ncloser to the events in question; that is, he will refer you to the\nbooks of Diodor, Plutarch, Arrian, etc. He can place before you pictures\nof the preserved coins and statues of the king and can pass down your\nrows a photograph of the Pompeiian mosaics of the battle of Issos. Yet,\nstrictly speaking, all these documents prove only that previous\ngenerations already believed in Alexander's existence and in the reality\nof his deeds, and your criticism might begin anew at this point. You\nwill then find that not everything recounted of Alexander is credible,\nor capable of proof in detail; yet even then I cannot believe that you\nwill leave the lecture hall a disbeliever in the reality of Alexander\nthe Great. Your decision will be determined chiefly by two\nconsiderations; firstly, that the lecturer has no conceivable motive for\npresenting as truth something which he does not himself believe to be\ntrue, and secondly, that all available histories present the events in\napproximately the same manner. If you then proceed to the verification\nof the older sources, you will consider the same data, the possible\nmotives of the writers and the consistency of the various parts of the\nevidence. The result of the examination will surely be convincing in the\ncase of Alexander. It will probably turn out differently when applied\nto individuals like Moses and Nimrod. But what doubts you might raise\nagainst the credibility of the psychoanalytic reporter you will see\nplainly enough upon a later occasion.\nAt this point you have a right to raise the question, \"If there is no\nsuch thing as objective verification of psychoanalysis, and no\npossibility of demonstrating it, how can one possibly learn\npsychoanalysis and convince himself of the truth of its claims?\" The\nfact is, the study is not easy and there are not many persons who have\nlearned psychoanalysis thoroughly; but nevertheless, there is a feasible\nway. Psychoanalysis is learned, first of all, from a study of one's\nself, through the study of one's own personality. This is not quite what\nis ordinarily called self-observation, but, at a pinch, one can sum it\nup thus. There is a whole series of very common and universally known\npsychic phenomena, which, after some instruction in the technique of\npsychoanalysis, one can make the subject matter of analysis in one's\nself. By so doing one obtains the desired conviction of the reality of\nthe occurrences which psychoanalysis describes and of the correctness of\nits fundamental conception. To be sure, there are definite limits\nimposed on progress by this method. One gets much further if one allows\nhimself to be analyzed by a competent analyst, observes the effect of\nthe analysis on his own ego, and at the same time makes use of the\nopportunity to become familiar with the finer details of the technique\nof procedure. This excellent method is, of course, only practicable for\none person, never for an entire class.\nThere is a second difficulty in your relation to psychoanalysis for\nwhich I cannot hold the science itself responsible, but for which I must\nask you to take the responsibility upon yourselves, ladies and\ngentlemen, at least in so far as you have hitherto pursued medical\nstudies. Your previous training has given your mental activity a\ndefinite bent which leads you far away from psychoanalysis. You have\nbeen trained to reduce the functions of an organism and its disorders\nanatomically, to explain them in terms of chemistry and physics and to\nconceive them biologically, but no portion of your interest has been\ndirected to the psychic life, in which, after all, the activity of this\nwonderfully complex organism culminates. For this reason psychological\nthinking has remained strange to you and you have accustomed yourselves\nto regard it with suspicion, to deny it the character of the scientific,\nto leave it to the laymen, poets, natural philosophers and mystics. Such\na delimitation is surely harmful to your medical activity, for the\npatient will, as is usual in all human relationships, confront you first\nof all with his psychic facade; and I am afraid your penalty will be\nthis, that you will be forced to relinquish a portion of the therapeutic\ninfluence to which you aspire, to those lay physicians, nature-cure\nfakers and mystics whom you despise.\nI am not overlooking the excuse, whose existence one must admit, for\nthis deficiency in your previous training. There is no philosophical\nscience of therapy which could be made practicable for your medical\npurpose. Neither speculative philosophy nor descriptive psychology nor\nthat so-called experimental psychology which allies itself with the\nphysiology of the sense organs as it is taught in the schools, is in a\nposition to teach you anything useful concerning the relation between\nthe physical and the psychical or to put into your hand the key to the\nunderstanding of a possible disorder of the psychic functions. Within\nthe field of medicine, psychiatry does, it is true, occupy itself with\nthe description of the observed psychic disorders and with their\ngrouping into clinical symptom-pictures; but in their better hours the\npsychiatrists themselves doubt whether their purely descriptive account\ndeserves the name of a science. The symptoms which constitute these\nclinical pictures are known neither in their origin, in their mechanism,\nnor in their mutual relationship. There are either no discoverable\ncorresponding changes of the anatomical organ of the soul, or else the\nchanges are of such a nature as to yield no enlightenment. Such psychic\ndisturbances are open to therapeutic influence only when they can be\nidentified as secondary phenomena of an otherwise organic affection.\nHere is the gap which psychoanalysis aims to fill. It prepares to give\npsychiatry the omitted psychological foundation, it hopes to reveal the\ncommon basis from which, as a starting point, constant correlation of\nbodily and psychic disturbances becomes comprehensible. To this end, it\nmust divorce itself from every anatomical, chemical or physiological\nsupposition which is alien to it. It must work throughout with purely\npsychological therapeutic concepts, and just for that reason I fear\nthat it will at first seem strange to you.\nI will not make you, your previous training, or your mental bias share\nthe guilt of the next difficulty. With two of its assertions,\npsychoanalysis offends the whole world and draws aversion upon itself.\nOne of these assertions offends an intellectual prejudice, the other an\naesthetic-moral one. Let us not think too lightly of these prejudices;\nthey are powerful things, remnants of useful, even necessary,\ndevelopments of mankind. They are retained through powerful affects, and\nthe battle against them is a hard one.\nThe first of these displeasing assertions of psychoanalysis is this,\nthat the psychic processes are in themselves unconscious, and that those\nwhich are conscious are merely isolated acts and parts of the total\npsychic life. Recollect that we are, on the contrary, accustomed to\nidentify the psychic with the conscious. Consciousness actually means\nfor us the distinguishing characteristic of the psychic life, and\npsychology is the science of the content of consciousness. Indeed, so\nobvious does this identification seem to us that we consider its\nslightest contradiction obvious nonsense, and yet psychoanalysis cannot\navoid raising this contradiction; it cannot accept the identity of the\nconscious with the psychic. Its definition of the psychic affirms that\nthey are processes of the nature of feeling, thinking, willing; and it\nmust assert that there is such a thing as unconscious thinking and\nunconscious willing. But with this assertion psychoanalysis has\nalienated, to start with, the sympathy of all friends of sober science,\nand has laid itself open to the suspicion of being a fantastic mystery\nstudy which would build in darkness and fish in murky waters. You,\nhowever, ladies and gentlemen, naturally cannot as yet understand what\njustification I have for stigmatizing as a prejudice so abstract a\nphrase as this one, that \"the psychic is consciousness.\" You cannot know\nwhat evaluation can have led to the denial of the unconscious, if such a\nthing really exists, and what advantage may have resulted from this\ndenial. It sounds like a mere argument over words whether one shall say\nthat the psychic coincides with the conscious or whether one shall\nextend it beyond that, and yet I can assure you that by the acceptance\nof unconscious processes you have paved the way for a decisively new\norientation in the world and in science.\nJust as little can you guess how intimate a connection this initial\nboldness of psychoanalysis has with the one which follows. The next\nassertion which psychoanalysis proclaims as one of its discoveries,\naffirms that those instinctive impulses which one can only call sexual\nin the narrower as well as in the wider sense, play an uncommonly large\nrole in the causation of nervous and mental diseases, and that those\nimpulses are a causation which has never been adequately appreciated.\nNay, indeed, psychoanalysis claims that these same sexual impulses have\nmade contributions whose value cannot be overestimated to the highest\ncultural, artistic and social achievements of the human mind.\nAccording to my experience, the aversion to this conclusion of\npsychoanalysis is the most significant source of the opposition which it\nencounters. Would you like to know how we explain this fact? We believe\nthat civilization was forged by the driving force of vital necessity, at\nthe cost of instinct-satisfaction, and that the process is to a large\nextent constantly repeated anew, since each individual who newly enters\nthe human community repeats the sacrifices of his instinct-satisfaction\nfor the sake of the common good. Among the instinctive forces thus\nutilized, the sexual impulses play a significant role. They are thereby\nsublimated, i.e., they are diverted from their sexual goals and directed\nto ends socially higher and no longer sexual. But this result is\nunstable. The sexual instincts are poorly tamed. Each individual who\nwishes to ally himself with the achievements of civilization is exposed\nto the danger of having his sexual instincts rebel against this\nsublimation. Society can conceive of no more serious menace to its\ncivilization than would arise through the satisfying of the sexual\ninstincts by their redirection toward their original goals. Society,\ntherefore, does not relish being reminded of this ticklish spot in its\norigin; it has no interest in having the strength of the sexual\ninstincts recognized and the meaning of the sexual life to the\nindividual clearly delineated. On the contrary, society has taken the\ncourse of diverting attention from this whole field. This is the reason\nwhy society will not tolerate the above-mentioned results of\npsychoanalytic research, and would prefer to brand it as aesthetically\noffensive and morally objectionable or dangerous. Since, however, one\ncannot attack an ostensibly objective result of scientific inquiry with\nsuch objections, the criticism must be translated to an intellectual\nlevel if it is to be voiced. But it is a predisposition of human nature\nto consider an unpleasant idea untrue, and then it is easy to find\narguments against it. Society thus brands what is unpleasant as untrue,\ndenying the conclusions of psychoanalysis with logical and pertinent\narguments. These arguments originate from affective sources, however,\nand society holds to these prejudices against all attempts at\nrefutation.\nHowever, we may claim, ladies and gentlemen, that we have followed no\nbias of any sort in making any of these contested statements. We merely\nwished to state facts which we believe to have been discovered by\ntoilsome labor. And we now claim the right unconditionally to reject the\ninterference in scientific research of any such practical\nconsiderations, even before we have investigated whether the\napprehension which these considerations are meant to instil are\njustified or not.\nThese, therefore, are but a few of the difficulties which stand in the\nway of your occupation with psychoanalysis. They are perhaps more than\nenough for a beginning. If you can overcome their deterrent impression,\nwe shall continue.\nSECOND LECTURE\nTHE PSYCHOLOGY OF ERRORS\nWe begin with an investigation, not with hypotheses. To this end we\nchoose certain phenomena which are very frequent, very familiar and very\nlittle heeded, and which have nothing to do with the pathological,\ninasmuch as they can be observed in every normal person. I refer to the\nerrors which an individual commits--as for example, errors of speech in\nwhich he wishes to say something and uses the wrong word; or those which\nhappen to him in writing, and which he may or may not notice; or the\ncase of misreading, in which one reads in the print or writing something\ndifferent from what is actually there. A similar phenomenon occurs in\nthose cases of mishearing what is said to one, where there is no\nquestion of an organic disturbance of the auditory function. Another\nseries of such occurrences is based on forgetfulness--but on a\nforgetfulness which is not permanent, but temporary, as for instance\nwhen one cannot think of a name which one knows and always recognizes;\nor when one forgets to carry out a project at the proper time but which\none remembers again later, and therefore has only forgotten for a\ncertain interval. In a third class this characteristic of transience is\nlacking, as for example in mislaying things so that they cannot be found\nagain, or in the analogous case of losing things. Here we are dealing\nwith a kind of forgetfulness to which one reacts differently from the\nother cases, a forgetfulness at which one is surprised and annoyed,\ninstead of considering it comprehensible. Allied with these phenomena is\nthat of erroneous ideas--in which the element of transience is again\nprominent, inasmuch as for a while one believes something which, before\nand after that time, one knows to be untrue--and a number of similar\nphenomena of different designations.\nThese are all occurrences whose inner connection is expressed in the\nuse of the same prefix of designation.[1] They are almost all\nunimportant, generally temporary and without much significance in the\nlife of the individual. It is only rarely that one of them, such as the\nphenomenon of losing things, attains to a certain practical importance.\nFor that reason also they do not attract much attention, they arouse\nonly weak affects.\nIt is, therefore, to these phenomena that I would now direct your\nattention. But you will object, with annoyance: \"There are so many\nsublime riddles in the external world, just as there are in the narrower\nworld of the psychic life, and so many wonders in the field of psychic\ndisturbances which demand and deserve elucidation, that it really seems\nfrivolous to waste labor and interest on such trifles. If you can\nexplain to us how an individual with sound eyes and ears can, in broad\ndaylight, see and hear things that do not exist, or why another\nindividual suddenly believes himself persecuted by those whom up to that\ntime he loved best, or defend, with the most ingenious arguments,\ndelusions which must seem nonsense to any child, then we will be willing\nto consider psychoanalysis seriously. But if psychoanalysis can do\nnothing better than to occupy us with the question of why a speaker used\nthe wrong word, or why a housekeeper mislaid her keys, or such trifles,\nthen we know something better to do with our time and interest.\"\nMy reply is: \"Patience, ladies and gentlemen. I think your criticism is\nnot on the right track. It is true that psychoanalysis cannot boast that\nit has never occupied itself with trifles. On the contrary, the objects\nof its observations are generally those simple occurrences which the\nother sciences have thrown aside as much too insignificant, the waste\nproducts of the phenomenal world. But are you not confounding, in your\ncriticism, the sublimity of the problems with the conspicuousness of\ntheir manifestations? Are there not very important things which under\ncertain circumstances, and at certain times, can betray themselves only\nby very faint signs? I could easily cite a great many instances of this\nkind. From what vague signs, for instance, do the young gentlemen of\nthis audience conclude that they have won the favor of a lady? Do you\nawait an explicit declaration, an ardent embrace, or does not a glance,\nscarcely perceptible to others, a fleeting gesture, the prolonging of a\nhand-shake by one second, suffice? And if you are a criminal lawyer, and\nengaged in the investigation of a murder, do you actually expect the\nmurderer to leave his photograph and address on the scene of the crime,\nor would you, of necessity, content yourself with fainter and less\ncertain traces of that individual? Therefore, let us not undervalue\nsmall signs; perhaps by means of them we will succeed in getting on the\ntrack of greater things. I agree with you that the larger problems of\nthe world and of science have the first claim on our interest. But it is\ngenerally of little avail to form the definite resolution to devote\noneself to the investigation of this or that problem. Often one does not\nknow in which direction to take the next step. In scientific research it\nis more fruitful to attempt what happens to be before one at the moment\nand for whose investigation there is a discoverable method. If one does\nthat thoroughly without prejudice or predisposition, one may, with good\nfortune, and by virtue of the connection which links each thing to every\nother (hence also the small to the great) discover even from such modest\nresearch a point of approach to the study of the big problems.\"\nThus would I answer, in order to secure your attention for the\nconsideration of these apparently insignificant errors made by normal\npeople. At this point, we will question a stranger to psychoanalysis and\nask him how he explains these occurrences.\nHis first answer is sure to be, \"Oh, they are not worth an explanation;\nthey are merely slight accidents.\" What does he mean by this? Does he\nmean to assert that there are any occurrences so insignificant that they\nfall out of the causal sequence of things, or that they might just as\nwell be something different from what they are? If any one thus denies\nthe determination of natural phenomena at one such point, he has\nvitiated the entire scientific viewpoint. One can then point out to him\nhow much more consistent is the religious point of view, when it\nexplicitly asserts that \"No sparrow falls from the roof without God's\nspecial wish.\" I imagine our friend will not be willing to follow his\nfirst answer to its logical conclusion; he will interrupt and say that\nif he were to study these things he would probably find an explanation\nfor them. He will say that this is a case of slight functional\ndisturbance, of an inaccurate psychic act whose causal factors can be\noutlined. A man who otherwise speaks correctly may make a slip of the\ntongue--when he is slightly ill or fatigued; when he is excited; when\nhis attention is concentrated on something else. It is easy to prove\nthese statements. Slips of the tongue do really occur with special\nfrequency when one is tired, when one has a headache or when one is\nindisposed. Forgetting proper names is a very frequent occurrence under\nthese circumstances. Many persons even recognize the imminence of an\nindisposition by the inability to recall proper names. Often also one\nmixes up words or objects during excitement, one picks up the wrong\nthings; and the forgetting of projects, as well as the doing of any\nnumber of other unintentional acts, becomes conspicuous when one is\ndistracted; in other words, when one's attention is concentrated on\nother things. A familiar instance of such distraction is the professor\nin _Fliegende Blaetter_, who takes the wrong hat because he is thinking\nof the problems which he wishes to treat in his next book. Each of us\nknows from experience some examples of how one can forget projects which\none has planned and promises which one has made, because an experience\nhas intervened which has preoccupied one deeply.\nThis seems both comprehensible and irrefutable. It is perhaps not very\ninteresting, not as we expected it to be. But let us consider this\nexplanation of errors. The conditions which have been cited as necessary\nfor the occurrence of these phenomena are not all identical. Illness and\ndisorders of circulation afford a physiological basis. Excitement,\nfatigue and distraction are conditions of a different sort, which one\ncould designate as psycho-physiological. About these latter it is easy\nto theorize. Fatigue, as well as distraction, and perhaps also general\nexcitement, cause a scattering of the attention which can result in the\nact in progress not receiving sufficient attention. This act can then be\nmore easily interrupted than usual, and may be inexactly carried out. A\nslight illness, or a change in the distribution of blood in the central\norgan of the nervous system, can have the same effect, inasmuch as it\ninfluences the determining factor, the distribution of attention, in a\nsimilar way. In all cases, therefore, it is a question of the effects of\na distraction of the attention, caused either by organic or psychic\nfactors.\nBut this does not seem to yield much of interest for our psychoanalytic\ninvestigation. We might even feel tempted to give up the subject. To be\nsure, when we look more closely we find that not everything squares\nwith this attention theory of psychological errors, or that at any rate\nnot everything can be directly deduced from it. We find that such errors\nand such forgetting occur even when people are not fatigued, distracted\nor excited, but are in every way in their normal state; unless, in\nconsequence of these errors, one were to attribute to them an excitement\nwhich they themselves do not acknowledge. Nor is the mechanism so simple\nthat the success of an act is assured by an intensification of the\nattention bestowed upon it, and endangered by its diminution. There are\nmany acts which one performs in a purely automatic way and with very\nlittle attention, but which are yet carried out quite successfully. The\npedestrian who scarcely knows where he is going, nevertheless keeps to\nthe right road and stops at his destination without having gone astray.\nAt least, this is the rule. The practiced pianist touches the right keys\nwithout thinking of them. He may, of course, also make an occasional\nmistake, but if automatic playing increased the likelihood of errors, it\nwould be just the virtuoso whose playing has, through practice, become\nmost automatic, who would be the most exposed to this danger. Yet we\nsee, on the contrary, that many acts are most successfully carried out\nwhen they are not the objects of particularly concentrated attention,\nand that the mistakes occur just at the point where one is most anxious\nto be accurate--where a distraction of the necessary attention is\ntherefore surely least permissible. One could then say that this is the\neffect of the \"excitement,\" but we do not understand why the excitement\ndoes not intensify the concentration of attention on the goal that is so\nmuch desired. If in an important speech or discussion anyone says the\nopposite of what he means, then that can hardly be explained according\nto the psycho-physiological or the attention theories.\nThere are also many other small phenomena accompanying these errors,\nwhich are not understood and which have not been rendered comprehensible\nto us by these explanations. For instance, when one has temporarily\nforgotten a name, one is annoyed, one is determined to recall it and is\nunable to give up the attempt. Why is it that despite his annoyance the\nindividual cannot succeed, as he wishes, in directing his attention to\nthe word which is \"on the tip of his tongue,\" and which he instantly\nrecognizes when it is pronounced to him? Or, to take another example,\nthere are cases in which the errors multiply, link themselves together,\nsubstitute for each other. The first time one forgets an appointment;\nthe next time, after having made a special resolution not to forget it,\none discovers that one has made a mistake in the day or hour. Or one\ntries by devious means to remember a forgotten word, and in the course\nof so doing loses track of a second name which would have been of use in\nfinding the first. If one then pursues this second name, a third gets\nlost, and so on. It is notorious that the same thing can happen in the\ncase of misprints, which are of course to be considered as errors of the\ntypesetter. A stubborn error of this sort is said to have crept into a\nSocial-Democratic paper, where, in the account of a certain festivity\nwas printed, \"Among those present was His Highness, the Clown Prince.\"\nThe next day a correction was attempted. The paper apologized and said,\n\"The sentence should, of course, have read 'The Clown Prince.'\" One\nlikes to attribute these occurrences to the printer's devil, to the\ngoblin of the typesetting machine, and the like--figurative expressions\nwhich at least go beyond a psycho-physiological theory of the misprint.\nI do not know if you are acquainted with the fact that one can provoke\nslips of the tongue, can call them forth by suggestion, as it were. An\nanecdote will serve to illustrate this. Once when a novice on the stage\nwas entrusted with the important role in _The Maid of Orleans_ of\nannouncing to the King, \"Connetable sheathes his sword,\" the star played\nthe joke of repeating to the frightened beginner during the rehearsal,\ninstead of the text, the following, \"Comfortable sends back his\nsteed,\"[2] and he attained his end. In the performance the unfortunate\nactor actually made his debut with this distorted announcement; even\nafter he had been amply warned against so doing, or perhaps just for\nthat reason.\nThese little characteristics of errors are not exactly illuminated by\nthe theory of diverted attention. But that does not necessarily prove\nthe whole theory wrong. There is perhaps something missing, a complement\nby the addition of which the theory would be made completely\nsatisfactory. But many of the errors themselves can be regarded from\nanother aspect.\nLet us select slips of the tongue, as best suited to our purposes. We\nmight equally well choose slips of the pen or of reading. But at this\npoint, we must make clear to ourselves the fact that so far we have\ninquired only as to when and under what conditions one's tongue slips,\nand have received an answer on this point only. One can, however, direct\none's interest elsewhere and ask why one makes just this particular slip\nand no other; one can consider what the slip results in. You must\nrealize that as long as one does not answer this question--does not\nexplain the effect produced by the slip--the phenomenon in its\npsychological aspect remains an accident, even if its physiological\nexplanation has been found. When it happens that I commit a slip of the\ntongue, I could obviously make any one of an infinite number of slips,\nand in place of the one right word say any one of a thousand others,\nmake innumerable distortions of the right word. Now, is there anything\nwhich forces upon me in a specific instance just this one special slip\nout of all those which are possible, or does that remain accidental and\narbitrary, and can nothing rational be found in answer to this question?\nTwo authors, Meringer and Mayer (a philologist and a psychiatrist) did\nindeed in 1895 make the attempt to approach the problem of slips of the\ntongue from this side. They collected examples and first treated them\nfrom a purely descriptive standpoint. That, of course, does not yet\nfurnish any explanation, but may open the way to one. They\ndifferentiated the distortions which the intended phrase suffered\nthrough the slip, into: interchanges of positions of words, interchanges\nof parts of words, perseverations, compoundings and substitutions. I\nwill give you examples of these authors' main categories. It is a case\nof interchange of the first sort if someone says \"the Milo of Venus\"\ninstead of \"the Venus of Milo.\" An example of the second type of\ninterchange, \"I had a blush of rood to the head\" instead of \"rush of\nblood\"; a perseveration would be the familiar misplaced toast, \"I ask\nyou to join me in hiccoughing the health of our chief.\"[3] These three\nforms of slips are not very frequent. You will find those cases much\nmore frequent in which the slip results from a drawing together or\ncompounding of syllables; for example, a gentleman on the street\naddresses a lady with the words, \"If you will allow me, madame, I should\nbe very glad to _inscort_ you.\"[4] In the compounded word there is\nobviously besides the word \"escort,\" also the word \"insult\" (and\nparenthetically we may remark that the young man will not find much\nfavor with the lady). As an example of the substitution, Meringer and\nMayer cite the following: \"A man says, 'I put the specimens in the\nletterbox,' instead of 'in the hot-bed,' and the like.\"[5]\nThe explanation which the two authors attempt to formulate on the basis\nof this collection of examples is peculiarly inadequate. They hold that\nthe sounds and syllables of words have different values, and that the\nproduction and perception of more highly valued syllables can interfere\nwith those of lower values. They obviously base this conclusion on the\ncases of fore-sounding and perseveration which are not at all frequent;\nin other cases of slips of the tongue the question of such sound\npriorities, if any exist, does not enter at all. The most frequent cases\nof slips of the tongue are those in which instead of a certain word one\nsays another which resembles it; and one may consider this resemblance\nsufficient explanation. For example, a professor says in his initial\nlecture, \"I am not _inclined_ to evaluate the merits of my\npredecessor.\"[6] Or another professor says, \"In the case of the female\ngenital, despite many _temptations_ ... I mean many attempts ...\netc.\"[7]\nThe most common, and also the most conspicuous form of slips of the\ntongue, however, is that of saying the exact opposite of what one meant\nto say. In such cases, one goes far afield from the problem of sound\nrelations and resemblance effects, and can cite, instead of these, the\nfact that opposites have an obviously close relationship to each other,\nand have particularly close relations in the psychology of association.\nThere are historical examples of this sort. A president of our House of\nRepresentatives once opened the assembly with the words, \"Gentlemen, I\ndeclare a quorum present, and herewith declare the assembly _closed_.\"\nSimilar, in its trickiness, to the relation of opposites is the effect\nof any other facile association which may under certain circumstances\narise most inopportunely. Thus, for instance, there is the story which\nrelates that on the occasion of a festivity in honor of the marriage of\na child of H. Helmholtz with a child of the well-known discoverer and\ncaptain of industry, W. Siemon, the famous physiologist Dubois-Reymond\nwas asked to speak. He concluded his undoubtedly sparkling toast with\nthe words, \"Success to the new firm--Siemens and--Halski!\" That, of\ncourse, was the name of the well-known old firm. The association of the\ntwo names must have been about as easy for a native of Berlin as \"Weber\nand Fields\" to an American.\nThus we must add to the sound relations and word resemblances the\ninfluence of word associations. But that is not all. In a series of\ncases, an explanation of the observed slip is unsuccessful unless we\ntake into account what phrase had been said or even thought previously.\nThis again makes it a case of perseveration of the sort stressed by\nMeringer, but of a longer duration. I must admit, I am on the whole of\nthe impression that we are further than ever from an explanation of\nslips of the tongue!\nHowever, I hope I am not wrong when I say that during the above\ninvestigation of these examples of slips of the tongue, we have all\nobtained a new impression on which it will be of value to dwell. We\nsought the general conditions under which slips of the tongue occur, and\nthen the influences which determine the kind of distortion resulting\nfrom the slip, but we have in no way yet considered the effect of the\nslip of the tongue in itself, without regard to its origin. And if we\nshould decide to do so we must finally have the courage to assert, \"In\nsome of the examples cited, the product of the slip also makes sense.\"\nWhat do we mean by \"it makes sense\"? It means, I think, that the product\nof the slip has itself a right to be considered as a valid psychic act\nwhich also has its purpose, as a manifestation having content and\nmeaning. Hitherto we have always spoken of errors, but now it seems as\nif sometimes the error itself were quite a normal act, except that it\nhas thrust itself into the place of some other expected or intended act.\nIn isolated cases this valid meaning seems obvious and unmistakable.\nWhen the president with his opening words closes the session of the\nHouse of Representatives, instead of opening it, we are inclined to\nconsider this error meaningful by reason of our knowledge of the\ncircumstances under which the slip occurred. He expects no good of the\nassembly, and would be glad if he could terminate it immediately. The\npointing out of this meaning, the interpretation of this error, gives us\nno difficulty. Or a lady, pretending to admire, says to another, \"I am\nsure you must have messed up this charming hat yourself.\"[8] No\nscientific quibbles in the world can keep us from discovering in this\nslip the idea \"this hat is a mess.\" Or a lady who is known for her\nenergetic disposition, relates, \"My husband asked the doctor to what\ndiet he should keep. But the doctor said he didn't need any diet, he\nshould eat and drink whatever _I_ want.\" This slip of tongue is quite an\nunmistakable expression of a consistent purpose.\nLadies and gentlemen, if it should turn out that not only a few cases of\nslips of the tongue and of errors in general, but the larger part of\nthem, have a meaning, then this meaning of errors of which we have\nhitherto made no mention, will unavoidably become of the greatest\ninterest to us and will, with justice, force all other points of view\ninto the background. We could then ignore all physiological and\npsycho-physiological conditions and devote ourselves to the purely\npsychological investigations of the sense, that is, the meaning, the\npurpose of these errors. To this end therefore we will not fail,\nshortly, to study a more extensive compilation of material.\nBut before we undertake this task, I should like to invite you to follow\nanother line of thought with me. It has repeatedly happened that a poet\nhas made use of slips of the tongue or some other error as a means of\npoetic presentation. This fact in itself must prove to us that he\nconsiders the error, the slip of the tongue for instance, as meaningful;\nfor he creates it on purpose, and it is not a case of the poet\ncommitting an accidental slip of the pen and then letting his pen-slip\nstand as a tongue-slip of his character. He wants to make something\nclear to us by this slip of the tongue, and we may examine what it is,\nwhether he wishes to indicate by this that the person in question is\ndistracted or fatigued. Of course, we do not wish to exaggerate the\nimportance of the fact that the poet did make use of a slip to express\nhis meaning. It could nevertheless really be a psychic accident, or\nmeaningful only in very rare cases, and the poet would still retain the\nright to infuse it with meaning through his setting. As to their poetic\nuse, however, it would not be surprising if we should glean more\ninformation concerning slips of the tongue from the poet than from the\nphilologist or the psychiatrist.\nSuch an example of a slip of the tongue occurs in _Wallenstein_\n(_Piccolomini_, Act 1, Scene 5). In the previous scene, Max Piccolomini\nhas most passionately sided with the Herzog, and dilated ardently on the\nblessings of peace which disclosed themselves to him during the trip on\nwhich he accompanied Wallenstein's daughter to the camp. He leaves his\nfather and the courtier, Questenberg, plunged in deepest consternation.\nAnd then the fifth scene continues:\nQ.\nAlas! Alas! and stands it so?\nWhat friend! and do we let him go away\nIn this delusion--let him go away?\nNot call him back immediately, not open\nHis eyes upon the spot?\nOCTAVIO.\n(_Recovering himself out of a deep study_)\nHe has now opened mine,\nAnd I see more than pleases me.\nQ.\nWhat is it?\nOCTAVIO.\nA curse on this journey!\nQ.\nBut why so? What is it?\nOCTAVIO.\nCome, come along, friend! I must follow up\nThe ominous track immediately. Mine eyes\nAre opened now, and I must use them. Come!\n(_Draws Q. on with him._)\nQ.\nWhat now? Where go you then?\nOCTAVIO.\n(_Hastily._) To _her_ herself\nQ.\nTo--\nOCTAVIO.\n(_Interrupting him and correcting himself._)\nTo the duke. Come, let us go--.\nOctavio meant to say, \"To him, to the lord,\" but his tongue slips and\nthrough his words \"_to her_\" he betrays to us, at least, the fact that\nhe had quite clearly recognized the influence which makes the young war\nhero dream of peace.\nA still more impressive example was found by O. Rank in Shakespeare. It\noccurs in the _Merchant of Venice_, in the famous scene in which the\nfortunate suitor makes his choice among the three caskets; and perhaps I\ncan do no better than to read to you here Rank's short account of the\nincident:\n\"A slip of the tongue which occurs in Shakespeare's _Merchant of\nVenice_, Act III, Scene II, is exceedingly delicate in its poetic\nmotivation and technically brilliant in its handling. Like the slip in\n_Wallenstein_ quoted by Freud (_Psychopathology of Everyday Life_, 2d\ned., p. 48), it shows that the poets well know the meaning of these\nerrors and assume their comprehensibility to the audience. Portia, who\nby her father's wish has been bound to the choice of a husband by lot,\nhas so far escaped all her unfavored suitors through the fortunes of\nchance. Since she has finally found in Bassanio the suitor to whom she\nis attached, she fears that he, too, will choose the wrong casket. She\nwould like to tell him that even in that event he may rest assured of\nher love, but is prevented from so doing by her oath. In this inner\nconflict the poet makes her say to the welcome suitor:\nPORTIA:\nI pray you tarry; pause a day or two,\nBefore you hazard; for, in choosing wrong\nI lose your company; therefore, forbear a while:\nThere's something tells me, (but it is not love)\nI would not lose you: * * *\n* * * I could teach you\nHow to choose right, but then I am forsworn,\nSo will I never be: so may you miss me;\nBut if you do, you'll make me wish a sin\nThat I had been forsworn. Beshrew your eyes.\nThey have o'erlook'd me, and divided me;\nOne half of me is yours, the other half _yours_,\n_Mine own_, I would say: but if mine, then yours,\nAnd so all yours.\nJust that, therefore, which she meant merely to indicate faintly to him\nor really to conceal from him entirely, namely that even before the\nchoice of the lot she was his and loved him, this the poet--with\nadmirable psychological delicacy of feeling--makes apparent by her slip;\nand is able, by this artistic device, to quiet the unbearable\nuncertainty of the lover, as well as the equal suspense of the audience\nas to the issue of the choice.\"\nNotice, at the end, how subtly Portia reconciles the two declarations\nwhich are contained in the slip, how she resolves the contradiction\nbetween them and finally still manages to keep her promise:\n\"* * * but if mine, then yours,\nAnd so all yours.\"\nAnother thinker, alien to the field of medicine, accidentally disclosed\nthe meaning of errors by an observation which has anticipated our\nattempts at explanation. You all know the clever satires of Lichtenberg\n(1742-1749), of which Goethe said, \"Where he jokes, there lurks a\nproblem concealed.\" Not infrequently the joke also brings to light the\nsolution of the problem. Lichtenberg mentions in his jokes and satiric\ncomments the remark that he always read \"Agamemnon\" for \"angenommen,\"[9]\nso intently had he read Homer. Herein is really contained the whole\ntheory of misreadings.\nAt the next session we will see whether we can agree with the poets in\ntheir conception of the meaning of psychological errors.\nTHIRD LECTURE\nTHE PSYCHOLOGY OF ERRORS--(_Continued_)\nAt the last session we conceived the idea of considering the error, not\nin its relation to the intended act which it distorted, but by itself\nalone, and we received the impression that in isolated instances it\nseems to betray a meaning of its own. We declared that if this fact\ncould be established on a larger scale, then the meaning of the error\nitself would soon come to interest us more than an investigation of the\ncircumstances under which the error occurs.\nLet us agree once more on what we understand by the \"meaning\" of a\npsychic process. A psychic process is nothing more than the purpose\nwhich it serves and the position which it holds in a psychic sequence.\nWe can also substitute the word \"purpose\" or \"intention\" for \"meaning\"\nin most of our investigations. Was it then only a deceptive appearance\nor a poetic exaggeration of the importance of an error which made us\nbelieve that we recognized a purpose in it?\nLet us adhere faithfully to the illustrative example of slips of the\ntongue and let us examine a larger number of such observations. We then\nfind whole categories of cases in which the intention, the meaning of\nthe slip itself, is clearly manifest. This is the case above all in\nthose examples in which one says the opposite of what one intended. The\npresident said, in his opening address, \"I declare the meeting closed.\"\nHis intention is certainly not ambiguous. The meaning and purpose of his\nslip is that he wants to terminate the meeting. One might point the\nconclusion with the remark \"he said so himself.\" We have only taken him\nat his word. Do not interrupt me at this point by remarking that this is\nnot possible, that we know he did not want to terminate the meeting but\nto open it, and that he himself, whom we have just recognized as the\nbest judge of his intention, will affirm that he meant to open it. In so\ndoing you forget that we have agreed to consider the error entirely by\nitself. Its relation to the intention which it distorts is to be\ndiscussed later. Otherwise you convict yourself of an error in logic by\nwhich you smoothly conjure away the problem under discussion; or \"beg\nthe question,\" as it is called in English.\nIn other cases in which the speaker has not said the exact opposite of\nwhat he intended, the slip may nevertheless express an antithetical\nmeaning. \"I am not _inclined_ to appreciate the merits of my\npredecessor.\" \"_Inclined_\" is not the opposite of \"_in a position to_,\"\nbut it is an open betrayal of intent in sharpest contradiction to the\nattempt to cope gracefully with the situation which the speaker is\nsupposed to meet.\nIn still other cases the slip simply adds a second meaning to the one\nintended. The sentence then sounds like a contradiction, an\nabbreviation, a condensation of several sentences. Thus the lady of\nenergetic disposition, \"He may eat and drink whatever _I_ please.\" The\nreal meaning of this abbreviation is as though the lady had said, \"He\nmay eat and drink whatever he pleases. But what does it matter what _he_\npleases! It is _I_ who do the pleasing.\" Slips of the tongue often give\nthe impression of such an abbreviation. For example, the anatomy\nprofessor, after his lecture on the human nostril, asks whether the\nclass has thoroughly understood, and after a unanimous answer in the\naffirmative, goes on to say: \"I can hardly believe that is so, since the\npeople who understand the human nostril can, even in a city of millions,\nbe counted on _one finger_--I mean, on the fingers of one hand.\" The\nabbreviated sentence here also has its meaning: it expresses the idea\nthat there is only one person who thoroughly understands the subject.\nIn contrast to these groups of cases are those in which the error does\nnot itself express its meaning, in which the slip of the tongue does not\nin itself convey anything intelligible; cases, therefore, which are in\nsharpest opposition to our expectations. If anyone, through a slip of\nthe tongue, distorts a proper name, or puts together an unusual\ncombination of syllables, then this very common occurrence seems already\nto have decided in the negative the question of whether all errors\ncontain a meaning. Yet closer inspection of these examples discloses the\nfact that an understanding of such a distortion is easily possible,\nindeed, that the difference between these unintelligible cases and the\nprevious comprehensible ones is not so very great.\nA man who was asked how his horse was, answered, \"Oh, it may _stake_--it\nmay take another month.\" When asked what he really meant to say, he\nexplained that he had been thinking that it was a _sorry_ business and\nthe coming together of \"_take_\" and \"_sorry_\" gave rise to \"_stake_.\"\n(Meringer and Mayer.)\nAnother man was telling of some incidents to which he had objected, and\nwent on, \"and then certain facts were _re-filed_.\" Upon being\nquestioned, he explained that he meant to stigmatize these facts as\n\"_filthy_.\" \"_Revealed_\" and \"_filthy_\" together produced the peculiar\n\"_re-filled_.\" (Meringer and Mayer.)\nYou will recall the case of the young man who wished to \"_inscort_\" an\nunknown lady. We took the liberty of resolving this word construction\ninto the two words \"_escort_\" and \"_insult_,\" and felt convinced of this\ninterpretation without demanding proof of it. You see from these\nexamples that even slips can be explained through the concurrence, the\ninterference, of two speeches of different intentions. The difference\narises only from the fact that in the one type of slip the intended\nspeech completely crowds out the other, as happens in those slips where\nthe opposite is said, while in the other type the intended speech must\nrest content with so distorting or modifying the other as to result in\nmixtures which seem more or less intelligible in themselves.\nWe believe that we have now grasped the secret of a large number of\nslips of the tongue. If we keep this explanation in mind we will be able\nto understand still other hitherto mysterious groups. In the case of the\ndistortion of names, for instance, we cannot assume that it is always an\ninstance of competition between two similar, yet different names. Still,\nthe second intention is not difficult to guess. The distorting of names\noccurs frequently enough not as a slip of the tongue, but as an attempt\nto give the name an ill-sounding or debasing character. It is a familiar\ndevice or trick of insult, which persons of culture early learned to do\nwithout, though they do not give it up readily. They often clothe it in\nthe form of a joke, though, to be sure, the joke is of a very low order.\nJust to cite a gross and ugly example of such a distortion of a name, I\nmention the fact that the name of the President of the French Republic,\n_Poincare_, has been at times, lately, transformed into\n\"_Schweinskarre_.\" It is therefore easy to assume that there is also\nsuch an intention to insult in the case of other slips of the tongue\nwhich result in the distortion of a name. In consequence of our\nadherence to this conception, similar explanations force themselves upon\nus, in the case of slips of the tongue whose effect is comical or\nabsurd. \"I call upon you to _hiccough_ the health of our chief.\"[10]\nHere the solemn atmosphere is unexpectedly disturbed by the introduction\nof a word that awakens an unpleasant image; and from the prototype of\ncertain expressions of insult and offense we cannot but suppose that\nthere is an intention striving for expression which is in sharp contrast\nto the ostensible respect, and which could be expressed about as\nfollows, \"You needn't believe this. I'm not really in earnest. I don't\ngive a whoop for the fellow--etc.\" A similar trick which passes for a\nslip of the tongue is that which transforms a harmless word into one\nwhich is indecent and obscene.[11]\nWe know that many persons have this tendency of intentionally making\nharmless words obscene for the sake of a certain lascivious pleasure it\ngives them. It passes as wit, and we always have to ask about a person\nof whom we hear such a thing, whether he intended it as a joke or\nwhether it occurred as a slip of the tongue.\nWell, here we have solved the riddle of errors with relatively little\ntrouble! They are not accidents, but valid psychic acts. They have their\nmeaning; they arise through the collaboration--or better, the mutual\ninterference--of two different intentions. I can well understand that at\nthis point you want to swamp me with a deluge of questions and doubts to\nbe answered and resolved before we can rejoice over this first result of\nour labors. I truly do not wish to push you to premature conclusions.\nLet us dispassionately weigh each thing in turn, one after the other.\nWhat would you like to say? Whether I think this explanation is valid\nfor all cases of slips of the tongue or only for a certain number?\nWhether one can extend this same conception to all the many other\nerrors--to mis-reading, slips of the pen, forgetting, picking up the\nwrong object, mislaying things, etc? In the face of the psychic nature\nof errors, what meaning is left to the factors of fatigue, excitement,\nabsent-mindedness and distraction of attention? Moreover, it is easy to\nsee that of the two competing meanings in an error, one is always\npublic, but the other not always. But what does one do in order to guess\nthe latter? And when one believes one has guessed it, how does one go\nabout proving that it is not merely a probable meaning, but that it is\nthe only correct meaning? Is there anything else you wish to ask? If\nnot, then I will continue. I would remind you of the fact that we really\nare not much concerned with the errors themselves, but we wanted only to\nlearn something of value to psychoanalysis from their study. Therefore,\nI put the question: What are these purposes or tendencies which can thus\ninterfere with others, and what relation is there between the\ninterfering tendencies and those interfered with? Thus our labor really\nbegins anew, after the explanation of the problem.\nNow, is this the explanation of all tongue slips? I am very much\ninclined to think so and for this reason, that as often as one\ninvestigates a case of a slip of the tongue, it reduces itself to this\ntype of explanation. But on the other hand, one cannot prove that a slip\nof the tongue cannot occur without this mechanism. It may be so; for our\npurposes it is a matter of theoretical indifference, since the\nconclusions which we wish to draw by way of an introduction to\npsychoanalysis remain untouched, even if only a minority of the cases of\ntongue slips come within our conception, which is surely not the case. I\nshall anticipate the next question, of whether or not we may extend to\nother types of errors what we have gleaned from slips of the tongue, and\nanswer it in the affirmative. You will convince yourselves of that\nconclusion when we turn our attention to the investigation of examples\nof pen slips, picking up wrong objects, etc. I would advise you,\nhowever, for technical reasons, to postpone this task until we shall\nhave investigated the tongue slip itself more thoroughly.\nThe question of what meaning those factors which have been placed in the\nforeground by some authors,--namely, the factors of circulatory\ndisturbances, fatigue, excitement, absent-mindedness, the theory of the\ndistraction of attention--the question of what meaning those factors can\nnow have for us if we accept the above described psychic mechanism of\ntongue slips, deserves a more detailed answer. You will note that we do\nnot deny these factors. In fact, it is not very often that\npsychoanalysis denies anything which is asserted on the other side. As a\nrule psychoanalysis merely adds something to such assertions and\noccasionally it does happen that what had hitherto been overlooked, and\nwas newly added by psychoanalysis, is just the essential thing. The\ninfluence on the occurrence of tongue slips of such physiological\npredispositions as result from slight illness, circulatory disturbances\nand conditions of fatigue, should be acknowledged without more ado.\nDaily personal experience can convince you of that. But how little is\nexplained by such an admission! Above all, they are not necessary\nconditions of the errors. Slips of the tongue are just as possible when\none is in perfect health and normal condition. Bodily factors,\ntherefore, have only the value of acting by way of facilitation and\nencouragement to the peculiar psychic mechanism of a slip of the tongue.\nTo illustrate this relationship, I once used a simile which I will now\nrepeat because I know of no better one as substitute. Let us suppose\nthat some dark night I go past a lonely spot and am there assaulted by a\nrascal who takes my watch and purse; and then, since I did not see the\nface of the robber clearly, I make my complaint at the nearest police\nstation in the following words: \"Loneliness and darkness have just\nrobbed me of my valuables.\" The police commissioner could then say to\nme: \"You seem to hold an unjustifiably extreme mechanistic conception.\nLet us rather state the case as follows: Under cover of darkness, and\nfavored by the loneliness, an unknown robber seized your valuables. The\nessential task in your case seems to me to be to discover the robber.\nPerhaps we can then take his booty from him again.\"\nSuch psycho-physiological moments as excitement, absent-mindedness and\ndistracted attention, are obviously of small assistance to us for the\npurpose of explanation. They are mere phrases, screens behind which we\nwill not be deterred from looking. The question is rather what in such\ncases has caused the excitement, the particular diversion of attention.\nThe influence of syllable sounds, word resemblances and the customary\nassociations which words arouse should also be recognized as having\nsignificance. They facilitate the tongue slip by pointing the path which\nit can take. But if I have a path before me, does that fact as a matter\nof course determine that I will follow it? After all, I must have a\nstimulus to make me decide for it, and, in addition, a force which\ncarries me forward on this path. These sound and word relationships\ntherefore serve also only to facilitate the tongue slip, just as the\nbodily dispositions facilitate them; they cannot give the explanation\nfor the word itself. Just consider, for example, the fact that in an\nenormously large number of cases, my lecturing is not disturbed by the\nfact that the words which I use recall others by their sound\nresemblance, that they are intimately associated with their opposites,\nor arouse common associations. We might add here the observation of the\nphilosopher Wundt, that slips of the tongue occur when, in consequence\nof bodily fatigue, the tendency to association gains the upper hand over\nthe intended speech. This would sound very plausible if it were not\ncontradicted by experiences which proved that from one series of cases\nof tongue-slips bodily stimuli were absent, and from another, the\nassociation stimuli were absent.\nHowever, your next question is one of particular interest to me, namely:\nin what way can one establish the existence of the two mutually\nantagonistic tendencies? You probably do not suspect how significant\nthis question is. It is true, is it not, that one of the two tendencies,\nthe tendency which suffers the interference, is always unmistakable? The\nperson who commits the error is aware of it and acknowledges it. It is\nthe other tendency, what we call the interfering tendency, which causes\ndoubt and hesitation. Now we have already learned, and you have surely\nnot forgotten, that these tendencies are, in a series of cases, equally\nplain. That is indicated by the effect of the slip, if only we have the\ncourage to let this effect be valid in itself. The president who said\nthe opposite of what he meant to say made it clear that he wanted to\nopen the meeting, but equally clear that he would also have liked to\nterminate it. Here the meaning is so plain that there is nothing left to\nbe interpreted. But the other cases in which the interfering tendency\nmerely distorts the original, without bringing itself to full\nexpression--how can one guess the interfering meaning from the\ndistortion?\nBy a very sure and simple method, in the first series of cases, namely,\nby the same method by which one establishes the existence of the\nmeaning interfered with. The latter is immediately supplied by the\nspeaker, who instantly adds the originally intended expression. \"It may\n_stake_--no, it may _take_ another month.\" Now we likewise ask him to\nexpress the interfering meaning; we ask him: \"Now, why did you first say\n_stake_?\" He answers, \"I meant to say--'This is a _sorry_ business.'\"\nAnd in the other case of the tongue slip--_re-filed_--the subject also\naffirms that he meant to say \"It is a _fil-thy_ business,\" but then\nmoderated his expression and turned it into something else. Thus the\ndiscovery of the interfering meaning was here as successful as the\ndiscovery of the one interfered with. Nor did I unintentionally select\nas examples cases which were neither related nor explained by me or by a\nsupporter of my theories. Yet a certain investigation was necessary in\nboth cases in order to obtain the solution. One had to ask the speaker\nwhy he made this slip, what he had to say about it. Otherwise he might\nperhaps have passed it by without seeking to explain it. When\nquestioned, however, he furnished the explanation by means of the first\nthing that came to his mind. And now you see, ladies and gentlemen, that\nthis slight investigation and its consequence are already a\npsychoanalysis, and the prototype of every psychoanalytic investigation\nwhich we shall conduct more extensively at a later time.\nNow, am I unduly suspicious if I suspect that at the same moment in\nwhich psychoanalysis emerges before you, your resistance to\npsychoanalysis also raises its head? Are you not anxious to raise the\nobjection that the information given by the subject we questioned, and\nwho committed the slip, is not proof sufficient? He naturally has the\ndesire, you say, to meet the challenge, to explain the slip, and hence\nhe says the first thing he can think of if it seems relevant. But that,\nyou say, is no proof that this is really the way the slip happened. It\nmight be so, but it might just as well be otherwise, you say. Something\nelse might have occurred to him which might have fitted the case just as\nwell and better.\nIt is remarkable how little respect, at bottom, you have for a psychic\nfact! Imagine that someone has decided to undertake the chemical\nanalysis of a certain substance, and has secured a sample of the\nsubstance, of a certain weight--so and so many milligrams. From this\nweighed sample certain definite conclusions can be drawn. Do you think\nit would ever occur to a chemist to discredit these conclusions by the\nargument that the isolated substance might have had some other weight?\nEveryone yields to the fact that it was just this weight and no other,\nand confidently builds his further conclusions upon that fact. But when\nyou are confronted by the psychic fact that the subject, when\nquestioned, had a certain idea, you will not accept that as valid, but\nsay some other idea might just as easily have occurred to him! The\ntrouble is that you believe in the illusion of psychic freedom and will\nnot give it up. I regret that on this point I find myself in complete\nopposition to your views.\nNow you will relinquish this point only to take up your resistance at\nanother place. You will continue, \"We understand that it is the peculiar\ntechnique of psychoanalysis that the solution of its problems is\ndiscovered by the analyzed subject himself. Let us take another example,\nthat in which the speaker calls upon the assembly 'to _hiccough_ the\nhealth of their chief.' The interfering idea in this case, you say, is\nthe insult. It is that which is the antagonist of the expression of\nconferring an honor. But that is mere interpretation on your part, based\non observations extraneous to the slip. If in this case you question the\noriginator of the slip, he will not affirm that he intended an insult,\non the contrary, he will deny it energetically. Why do you not give up\nyour unverifiable interpretation in the face of this plain objection?\"\nYes, this time you struck a hard problem. I can imagine the unknown\nspeaker. He is probably an assistant to the guest of honor, perhaps\nalready a minor official, a young man with the brightest prospects. I\nwill press him as to whether he did not after all feel conscious of\nsomething which may have worked in opposition to the demand that he do\nhonor to the chief. What a fine success I'll have! He becomes impatient\nand suddenly bursts out on me, \"Look here, you'd better stop this\ncross-examination, or I'll get unpleasant. Why, you'll spoil my whole\ncareer with your suspicions. I simply said '_auf_-gestossen' instead of\n'_an_-gestossen,' because I'd already said '_auf_' twice in the same\nsentence. It's the thing that Meringer calls a perservation, and there's\nno other meaning that you can twist out of it. Do you understand me?\nThat's all.\" H'm, this is a surprising reaction, a really energetic\ndenial. I see that there is nothing more to be obtained from the young\nman, but I also remark to myself that he betrays a strong personal\ninterest in having his slip mean nothing. Perhaps you, too, agree that\nit is not right for him immediately to become so rude over a purely\ntheoretical investigation, but, you will conclude, he really must know\nwhat he did and did not mean to say.\nReally? Perhaps that's open to question nevertheless.\nBut now you think you have me. \"So that is your technique,\" I hear you\nsay. \"When the person who has committed a slip gives an explanation\nwhich fits your theory, then you declare him the final authority on the\nsubject. 'He says so himself!' But if what he says does not fit into\nyour scheme, then you suddenly assert that what he says does not count,\nthat one need not believe him.\"\nYet that is certainly true. I can give you a similar case in which the\nprocedure is apparently just as monstrous. When a defendant confesses to\na deed, the judge believes his confession. But if he denies it, the\njudge does not believe him. Were it otherwise, there would be no way to\nadminister the law, and despite occasional miscarriages you must\nacknowledge the value of this system.\nWell, are you then the judge, and is the person who committed the slip a\ndefendant before you? Is a slip of the tongue a crime?\nPerhaps we need not even decline this comparison. But just see to what\nfar-reaching differences we have come by penetrating somewhat into the\nseemingly harmless problems of the psychology of errors, differences\nwhich at this stage we do not at all know how to reconcile. I offer you\na preliminary compromise on the basis of the analogy of the judge and\nthe defendant. You will grant me that the meaning of an error admits of\nno doubt when the subject under analysis acknowledges it himself. I in\nturn will admit that a direct proof for the suspected meaning cannot be\nobtained if the subject denies us the information; and, of course, that\nis also the case when the subject is not present to give us the\ninformation. We are, then, as in the case of the legal procedure,\ndependent on circumstances which make a decision at one time seem more,\nand at another time, less probable to us. At law, one has to declare a\ndefendant guilty on circumstantial evidence for practical reasons. We\nsee no such necessity; but neither are we forced to forego the use of\nthese circumstances. It would be a mistake to believe that a science\nconsists of nothing but conclusively proved theorems, and any such\ndemand would be unjust. Only a person with a mania for authority, a\nperson who must replace his religious catechism with some other, even\nthough it be scientific, would make such a demand. Science has but few\napodeictic precepts in its catechism; it consists chiefly of assertions\nwhich it has developed to certain degrees of probability. It is actually\na symptom of scientific thinking if one is content with these\napproximations of certainty and is able to carry on constructive work\ndespite the lack of the final confirmation.\nBut where do we get the facts for our interpretations, the circumstances\nfor our proof, when the further remarks of the subject under analysis do\nnot themselves elucidate the meaning of the error? From many sources.\nFirst of all, from the analogy with phenomena extraneous to the\npsychology of errors; as, for example, when we assert that the\ndistortion of a name as a slip of the tongue has the same insulting\nsignificance as an intentional name distortion. We get them also from\nthe psychic situation in which the error occurred, from our knowledge of\nthe character of the person who committed the error, from the\nimpressions which that person received before making the error, and to\nwhich he may possibly have reacted with this error. As a rule, what\nhappens is that we find the meaning of the error according to general\nprinciples. It is then only a conjecture, a suggestion as to what the\nmeaning may be, and we then obtain our proof from examination of the\npsychic situation. Sometimes, too, it happens that we have to wait for\nsubsequent developments, which have announced themselves, as it were,\nthrough the error, in order to find our conjecture verified.\nI cannot easily give you proof of this if I have to limit myself to the\nfield of tongue slips, although even here there are a few good examples.\nThe young man who wished to \"_inscort_\" the lady is certainly shy; the\nlady whose husband may eat and drink whatever _she_ wants I know to be\none of those energetic women who know how to rule in the home. Or take\nthe following case: At a general meeting of the Concordia Club, a young\nmember delivers a vehement speech in opposition, in the course of which\nhe addresses the officers of the society as: \"Fellow committee\nlenders.\" We will conjecture that some conflicting idea militated in him\nagainst his opposition, an idea which was in some way based on a\nconnection with money lending. As a matter of fact, we learn from our\ninformant that the speaker was in constant money difficulties, and had\nattempted to raise a loan. As a conflicting idea, therefore, we may\nsafely interpolate the idea, \"Be more moderate in your opposition, these\nare the same people who are to grant you the loan.\"\nBut I can give you a wide selection of such circumstantial proof if I\ndelve into the wide field of other kinds of error.\nIf anyone forgets an otherwise familiar proper name, or has difficulty\nin retaining it in his memory despite all efforts, then the conclusion\nlies close at hand, that he has something against the bearer of this\nname and does not like to think of him. Consider in this connection the\nfollowing revelation of the psychic situation in which this error\noccurs:\n\"A Mr. Y. fell in love, without reciprocation, with a lady who soon\nafter married a Mr. X. In spite of the fact that Mr. Y. has known Mr. X.\na long time, and even has business relations with him, he forgets his\nname over and over again, so that he found it necessary on several\noccasions to ask other people the man's name when he wanted to write to\nMr. X.\"[12]\nMr. Y. obviously does not want to have his fortunate rival in mind under\nany condition. \"Let him never be thought of.\"\nAnother example: A lady makes inquiries at her doctor's concerning a\nmutual acquaintance, but speaks of her by her maiden name. She has\nforgotten her married name. She admits that she was much displeased by\nthe marriage, and could not stand this friend's husband.[13]\nLater we shall have much to say in other relations about the matter of\nforgetting names. At present we are predominantly interested in the\npsychic situation in which the lapse of memory occurs.\nThe forgetting of projects can quite commonly be traced to an\nantagonistic current which does not wish to carry out the project. We\npsychoanalysts are not alone in holding this view, but this is the\ngeneral conception to which all persons subscribe the daily affairs, and\nwhich they first deny in theory. The patron who makes apologies to his\nprotege, saying that he has forgotten his requests, has not squared\nhimself with his protege. The protege immediately thinks: \"There's\nnothing to that; he did promise but he really doesn't want to do it.\"\nHence, daily life also proscribes forgetting, in certain connections,\nand the difference between the popular and the psychoanalytic conception\nof these errors appears to be removed. Imagine a housekeeper who\nreceives her guest with the words: \"What, you come to-day? Why, I had\ntotally forgotten that I had invited you for to-day\"; or the young man\nwho might tell his sweetheart that he had forgotten to keep the\nrendezvous which they planned. He is sure not to admit it, it were\nbetter for him to invent the most improbable excuses on the spur of the\nmoment, hindrances which prevented him from coming at that time, and\nwhich made it impossible for him to communicate the situation to her. We\nall know that in military matters the excuse of having forgotten\nsomething is useless, that it protects one from no punishment; and we\nmust consider this attitude justified. Here we suddenly find everyone\nagreed that a certain error is significant, and everyone agrees what its\nmeaning is. Why are they not consistent enough to extend this insight to\nthe other errors, and fully to acknowledge them? Of course, there is\nalso an answer to this.\nIf the meaning of this forgetting of projects leaves room for so little\ndoubt among laymen, you will be less surprised to find that poets make\nuse of these errors in the same sense. Those of you who have seen or\nread Shaw's _Caesar and Cleopatra_ will recall that Caesar, when\ndeparting in the last scene, is pursued by the idea that there was\nsomething more he intended to do, but that he had forgotten it. Finally\nhe discovers what it is: to take leave of Cleopatra. This small device\nof the author is meant to ascribe to the great Caesar a superiority\nwhich he did not possess, and to which he did not at all aspire. You can\nlearn from historical sources that Caesar had Cleopatra follow him to\nRome, and that she was staying there with her little Caesarion when\nCaesar was murdered, whereupon she fled the city.\nThe cases of forgetting projects are as a rule so clear that they are of\nlittle use for our purpose, i.e., discovering in the psychic situation\ncircumstantial evidence of the meaning of the error. Let us, therefore,\nturn to a particularly ambiguous and untransparent error, that of losing\nand mislaying objects. That we ourselves should have a purpose in losing\nan object, an accident frequently so painful, will certainly seem\nincredible to you. But there are many instances similar to the\nfollowing: A young man loses the pencil which he had liked very much.\nThe day before he had received a letter from his brother-in-law, which\nconcluded with the words, \"For the present I have neither the\ninclination nor the time to be a party to your frivolity and your\nidleness.\"[14] It so happened that the pencil had been a present from\nthis brother-in-law. Without this coincidence we could not, of course,\nassert that the loss involved any intention to get rid of the gift.\nSimilar cases are numerous. Persons lose objects when they have fallen\nout with the donors, and no longer wish to be reminded of them. Or\nagain, objects may be lost if one no longer likes the things themselves,\nand wants to supply oneself with a pretext for substituting other and\nbetter things in their stead. Letting a thing fall and break naturally\nshows the same intention toward that object. Can one consider it\naccidental when a school child just before his birthday loses, ruins or\nbreaks his belongings, for example his school bag or his watch?\nHe who has frequently experienced the annoyance of not being able to\nfind something which he has himself put away, will also be unwilling to\nbelieve there was any intent behind the loss. And yet the examples are\nnot at all rare in which the attendant circumstances of the mislaying\npoint to a tendency temporarily or permanently to get rid of the object.\nPerhaps the most beautiful example of this sort is the following: A\nyoung man tells me: \"A few years ago a misunderstanding arose in my\nmarried life. I felt my wife was too cool and even though I willingly\nacknowledged her excellent qualities, we lived without any tenderness\nbetween us. One day she brought me a book which she had thought might\ninterest me. I thanked her for this attention, promised to read the\nbook, put it in a handy place, and couldn't find it again. Several\nmonths passed thus, during which I occasionally remembered this mislaid\nbook and tried in vain to find it. About half a year later my beloved\nmother, who lived at a distance from us, fell ill. My wife left the\nhouse in order to nurse her mother-in-law. The condition of the patient\nbecame serious, and gave my wife an opportunity of showing her best\nside. One evening I came home filled with enthusiasm and gratitude\ntoward my wife. I approached my writing desk, opened a certain drawer\nwith no definite intention but as if with somnambulistic certainty, and\nthe first thing I found is the book so long mislaid.\"\nWith the cessation of the motive, the inability to find the mislaid\nobject also came to an end.\nLadies and gentlemen, I could increase this collection of examples\nindefinitely. But I do not wish to do so here. In my _Psychopathology of\nEveryday Life_ (first published in 1901), you will find only too many\ninstances for the study of errors.[15]\nAll these examples demonstrate the same thing repeatedly: namely, they\nmake it seem probable that errors have a meaning, and show how one may\nguess or establish that meaning from the attendant circumstances. I\nlimit myself to-day because we have confined ourselves to the purpose of\nprofiting in the preparation for psychoanalysis from the study of these\nphenomena. I must, however, still go into two additional groups of\nobservations, into the accumulated and combined errors and into the\nconfirmation of our interpretations by means of subsequent developments.\nThe accumulated and combined errors are surely the fine flower of their\nspecies. If we were interested only in proving that errors may have a\nmeaning, we would limit ourselves to the accumulated and combined errors\nin the first place, for here the meaning is unmistakable, even to the\ndullest intelligence, and can force conviction upon the most critical\njudgment. The accumulation of manifestations betrays a stubbornness such\nas could never come about by accident, but which fits closely the idea\nof design. Finally, the interchange of certain kinds of error with each\nother shows us what is the important and essential element of the error,\nnot its form or the means of which it avails itself, but the purpose\nwhich it serves and which is to be achieved by the most various paths.\nThus I will give you a case of repeated forgetting. Jones recounts that\nhe once allowed a letter to lie on his writing desk several days for\nreasons quite unknown. Finally he made up his mind to mail it; but it\nwas returned from the dead letter office, for he had forgotten to\naddress it. After he had addressed it he took it to the post office, but\nthis time without a stamp. At this point he finally had to admit to\nhimself his aversion against sending the letter at all.\nIn another case a mistake is combined with mislaying an object. A lady\nis traveling to Rome with her brother-in-law, a famous artist. The\nvisitor is much feted by the Germans living in Rome, and receives as a\ngift, among other things, a gold medal of ancient origin. The lady is\nvexed by the fact that her brother-in-law does not sufficiently\nappreciate the beautiful object. After she leaves her sister and reaches\nher home, she discovers when unpacking that she has brought with\nher--how, she does not know--the medal. She immediately informs her\nbrother-in-law of this fact by letter, and gives him notice that she\nwill send the medal back to Rome the next day. But on the following day,\nthe medal has been so cleverly mislaid that it can neither be found nor\nsent, and at this point it begins to dawn upon the lady that her\n\"absent-mindedness\" means, namely, that she wants to keep the object for\nherself.[16]\nI have already given you an example of a combination of forgetfulness\nand error in which someone first forgot a rendezvous and then, with the\nfirm intention of not forgetting it a second time, appeared at the wrong\nhour. A quite analogous case was told me from his own experience, by a\nfriend who pursues literary interests in addition to his scientific\nones. He said: \"A few years ago I accepted the election to the board of\na certain literary society, because I hoped that the society could at\nsome time be of use to me in helping obtain the production of my drama,\nand, despite my lack of interest, I took part in the meetings every\nFriday. A few months ago I received the assurance of a production in the\ntheatre in F., and since that time it happens regularly that I forget\nthe meetings of that society. When I read your article on these things,\nI was ashamed of my forgetfulness, reproached myself with the meanness\nof staying away now that I no longer need these people and determined to\nbe sure not to forget next Friday. I kept reminding myself of this\nresolution until I carried it out and stood before the door of the\nmeeting room. To my astonishment, it was closed, the meeting was already\nover; for I had mistaken the day. It was already Saturday.\"\nIt would be tempting enough to collect similar observations, but I will\ngo no further; I will let you glance instead upon those cases in which\nour interpretation has to wait for its proof upon future developments.\nThe chief condition of these cases is conceivably that the existing\npsychic situation is unknown to us or inaccessible to our inquiries. At\nthat time our interpretation has only the value of a conjecture to which\nwe ourselves do not wish to grant too much weight. Later, however,\nsomething happens which shows us how justified was our interpretation\neven at that time. I was once the guest of a young married couple and\nheard the young wife laughingly tell of a recent experience, of how on\nthe day after her return from her honeymoon she had hunted up her\nunmarried sister again in order to go shopping with her, as in former\ntimes, while her husband went to his business. Suddenly she noticed a\ngentleman on the other side of the street, and she nudged her sister,\nsaying, \"Why look, there goes Mr. K.\" She had forgotten that this\ngentleman was her husband of some weeks' standing. I shuddered at this\ntale but did not dare to draw the inference. The little anecdote did not\noccur to me again until a year later, after this marriage had come to a\nmost unhappy end.\nA. Maeder tells of a lady who, the day before her wedding, forgot to try\non her wedding dress and to the despair of the dressmaker only\nremembered it later in the evening. He adds in connection with this\nforgetfulness the fact that she divorced her husband soon after. I know\na lady now divorced from her husband, who, in managing her fortune,\nfrequently signed documents with her maiden name, and this many years\nbefore she really resumed it. I know of other women who lost their\nwedding rings on their honeymoon and also know that the course of the\nmarriage gave a meaning to this accident. And now one more striking\nexample with a better termination. It is said that the marriage of a\nfamous German chemist did not take place because he forgot the hour of\nthe wedding, and instead of going to the church went to the laboratory.\nHe was wise enough to rest satisfied with this one attempt, and died\nunmarried at a ripe old age.\nPerhaps the idea has also come to you that in these cases mistakes have\ntaken the place of the _Omina_ or omens of the ancients. Some of the\n_Omina_ really were nothing more than mistakes; for example, when a\nperson stumbled or fell down. Others, to be sure, bore the\ncharacteristics of objective occurrences rather than that of subjective\nacts. But you would not believe how difficult it sometimes is to decide\nin a specific instance whether the act belongs to the one or the other\ngroup. It so frequently knows how to masquerade as a passive experience.\nEveryone of us who can look back over a longer or shorter life\nexperience will probably say that he might have spared himself many\ndisappointments and painful surprises if he had found the courage and\ndecision to interpret as omens the little mistakes which he made in his\nintercourse with people, and to consider them as indications of the\nintentions which were still being kept secret. As a rule, one does not\ndare do this. One would feel as though he were again becoming\nsuperstitious via a detour through science. But not all omens come true,\nand you will understand from our theories that they need not all come\ntrue.\nFOURTH LECTURE\nTHE PSYCHOLOGY OF ERRORS--(_Conclusion_)\nWe may certainly put it down as the conclusion of our labors up to this\npoint that errors have a meaning, and we may make this conclusion the\nbasis of our further investigations. Let me stress the fact once more\nthat we do not assert--and for our purposes need not assert--that every\nsingle mistake which occurs is meaningful, although I consider that\nprobable. It will suffice us if we prove the presence of such a meaning\nwith relative frequency in the various forms of errors. These various\nforms, by the way, behave differently in this respect. In the cases of\ntongue slips, pen slips, etc., the occurrences may take place on a\npurely physiological basis. In the group based on forgetfulness\n(forgetting names or projects, mislaying objects, etc.) I cannot believe\nin such a basis. There does very probably exist a type of case in which\nthe loss of objects should be recognized as unintentional. Of the\nmistakes which occur in daily life, only a certain portion can in any\nway be brought within our conception. You must keep this limitation in\nmind when we start henceforth from the assumption that mistakes are\npsychic acts and arise through the mutual interference of two\nintentions.\nHerein we have the first result of psychoanalysis. Psychology hitherto\nknew nothing of the occurrence of such interferences and the possibility\nthat they might have such manifestations as a consequence. We have\nwidened the province of the world of psychic phenomena quite\nconsiderably, and have brought into the province of psychology phenomena\nwhich formerly were not attributed to it.\nLet us tarry a moment longer over the assertion that errors are psychic\nacts. Does such an assertion contain more than the former declaration\nthat they have a meaning? I do not believe so. On the contrary, it is\nrather more indefinite and open to greater misunderstanding. Everything\nwhich can be observed about the psychic life will on occasion be\ndesignated as a psychic phenomenon. But it will depend on whether the\nspecific psychic manifestations resulted directly from bodily, organic,\nmaterial influences, in which case their investigation will not fall\nwithin the province of psychology, or whether it was more immediately\nthe result of other psychic occurrences back of which, somewhere, the\nseries of organic influences then begins. We have the latter condition\nof affairs before us when we designate a phenomenon as a psychic\nmanifestation, and for that reason it is more expedient to put our\nassertion in this form: the phenomena are meaningful; they have a\nmeaning. By \"meaning\" we understand significance, purpose, tendency and\nposition in a sequence of psychic relations.\nThere are a number of other occurrences which are very closely related\nto errors, but which this particular name no longer fits. We call them\n_accidental and symptomatic_ acts. They also have the appearance of\nbeing unmotivated, the appearance of insignificance and unimportance,\nbut in addition, and more plainly, of superfluity. They are\ndifferentiated from errors by the absence of another intention with\nwhich they collide and by which they are disturbed. On the other side\nthey pass over without a definite boundary line into the gestures and\nmovements which we count among expressions of the emotions. Among these\naccidental acts belong all those apparently playful, apparently\npurposeless performances in connection with our clothing, parts of our\nbody, objects within reach, as well as the omission of such\nperformances, and the melodies which we hum to ourselves. I venture the\nassertion that all these phenomena are meaningful and capable of\ninterpretation in the same way as are the errors, that they are small\nmanifestations of other more important psychic processes, valid psychic\nacts. But I do not intend to linger over this new enlargement of the\nprovince of psychic phenomena, but rather to return to the topic of\nerrors, in the consideration of which the important psychoanalytic\ninquiries can be worked out with far greater clarity.\nThe most interesting questions which we formulated while considering\nerrors, and which we have not yet answered, are, I presume, the\nfollowing: We said that the errors are the result of the mutual\ninterference of two different intentions, of which the one can be called\nthe intention interfered with, and the other the interfering intention.\nThe intentions interfered with give rise to no further questions, but\nconcerning the others we want to know, firstly, what kind of intentions\nare these which arise as disturbers of others, and secondly, in what\nproportions are the interfering related to the interfered?\nWill you permit me again to take the slip of the tongue as\nrepresentative of the whole species and allow me to answer the second\nquestion before the first?\nThe interfering intention in the tongue slip may stand in a significant\nrelation to the intention interfered with, and then the former contains\na contradiction of the latter, correcting or supplementing it. Or, to\ntake a less intelligible and more interesting case, the interfering\nintention has nothing to do with the intention interfered with.\nProofs for the first of the two relations we can find without trouble in\nthe examples which we already know and in others similar to those. In\nalmost all cases of tongue slips where one says the contrary of what he\nintended, where the interfering intention expresses the antithesis of\nthe intention interfered with, the error is the presentation of the\nconflict between two irreconcilable strivings. \"I declare the meeting\nopened, but would rather have it closed,\" is the meaning of the\npresident's slip. A political paper which has been accused of\ncorruptibility, defends itself in an article meant to reach a climax in\nthe words: \"Our readers will testify that we have always interceded for\nthe good of all in the most _disinterested_ manner.\" But the editor who\nhad been entrusted with the composition of the defence, wrote, \"in the\nmost _interested_ manner.\" That is, he thinks \"To be sure, I have to\nwrite this way, but I know better.\" A representative of the people who\nurges that the Kaiser should be told the truth \"_rueckhaltlos_,\" hears an\ninner voice which is frightened by his boldness, and which through a\nslip changes the \"_rueckhaltlos_\" into \"_rueckgratlos_.\"[17]\nIn the examples familiar to you, which give the impression of\ncontraction and abbreviation, it is a question of a correction, an\naddition or continuation by which the second tendency manifests itself\ntogether with the first. \"Things were revealed, but better say it right\nout, they were _filthy_, therefore, things were _refiled_.\"[18] \"The\npeople who understand this topic can be counted on the _fingers of one\nhand_, but no, there is really only _one_ who understands it; therefore,\ncounted _on one finger_.\" Or, \"My husband may eat and drink whatever\n_he_ wants. But you know very well that _I_ don't permit him to want\nanything; therefore he may eat and drink whatever _I want_.\" In all\nthese cases, therefore, the slip arises from the content of the\nintention itself, or is connected with it.\nThe other type of relationship between the two interfering intentions\nseems strange. If the interfering intention has nothing to do with the\ncontent of the one interfered with, where then does it come from and how\ndoes it happen to make itself manifest as interference just at that\npoint? The observation which alone can furnish an answer here,\nrecognizes the fact that the interference originates in a thought\nprocess which has just previously occupied the person in question and\nwhich then has that after-effect, irrespective of whether it has already\nfound expression in speech or not. It is therefore really to be\ndesignated as perseveration, but not necessarily as the perseveration of\nspoken words. Here also there is no lack of an associative connection\nbetween the interfering and the interfered with, yet it is not given in\nthe content, but artificially restored, often by means of forced\nconnecting links.\nHere is a simple example of this, which I myself observed. In our\nbeautiful Dolomites, I meet two Viennese ladies who are gotten up as\ntourists. I accompany them a short distance and we discuss the\npleasures, but also the difficulties of the tourist's mode of life. One\nlady admits this way of spending the day entails much discomfort. \"It is\ntrue,\" she says, \"that it is not at all pleasant, when one has tramped\nall day in the sun, and waist and shirt are soaked through.\" At this\npoint in this sentence she suddenly has to overcome a slight hesitancy.\nThen she continues: \"But then, when one gets _nach Hose_, and can\nchange....\"[19] We did not analyze this slip, but I am sure you can\neasily understand it. The lady wanted to make the enumeration more\ncomplete and to say, \"Waist, shirt and drawers.\" From motives of\npropriety, the mention of the drawers (Hose) was suppressed, but in the\nnext sentence of quite independent content the unuttered word came to\nlight as a distortion of the similar word, house (Hause).\nNow we can turn at last to the long delayed main question, namely, what\nkind of intentions are these which get themselves expressed in an\nunusual way as interferences of others, intentions within whose great\nvariety we wish nevertheless to find what is common to them all! If we\nexamine a series of them to this end, we will soon find that they divide\nthemselves into three groups. In the first group belong the cases in\nwhich the interfering tendency is known to the speaker, and which,\nmoreover, was felt by him before the slip. Thus, in the case of the slip\n\"_refilled_,\" the speaker not only admits that he agreed with the\njudgment \"_filthy_,\" on the incidents in question, but also that he had\nthe intention (which he later abandoned) of giving it verbal expression.\nA second group is made up of those cases in which the interfering\ntendency is immediately recognized by the subject as his own, but in\nwhich he is ignorant of the fact that the interfering tendency was\nactive in him just before the slip. He therefore accepts our\ninterpretation, yet remains to a certain extent surprised by it.\nExamples of this situation can perhaps more easily be found among errors\nother than slips of the tongue. In a third group the interpretation of\nthe interfering intention is energetically denied by the speaker. He not\nonly denies that the interfering tendency was active in him before the\nslip, but he wants to assert that it was at all times completely alien\nto him. Will you recall the example of \"hiccough,\" and the absolutely\nimpolite disavowal which I received at the hands of this speaker by my\ndisclosure of the interfering intention. You know that so far we have no\nunity in our conception of these cases. I pay no attention to the\ntoastmaster's disavowal and hold fast to my interpretation; while you, I\nam sure, are yet under the influence of his repudiation and are\nconsidering whether one ought not to forego the interpretation of such\nslips, and let them pass as purely physiological acts, incapable of\nfurther analysis. I can imagine what it is that frightens you off. My\ninterpretation draws the conclusion that intentions of which he himself\nknows nothing may manifest themselves in a speaker, and that I can\ndeduce them from the circumstances. You hesitate before so novel a\nconclusion and one so full of consequences. I understand that, and\nsympathize with you to that extent. But let us make one thing clear: if\nyou want consistently to carry through the conception of errors which\nyou have derived from so many examples, you must decide to accept the\nabove conclusion, even though it be unpleasant. If you cannot do so, you\nmust give up that understanding of errors which you have so recently\nwon.\nLet us tarry a while over the point which unites the three groups, which\nis common to the three mechanisms of tongue slips. Fortunately, that is\nunmistakable. In the first two groups the interfering tendency is\nrecognized by the speaker; in the first there is the additional fact\nthat it showed itself immediately before the slip. In both cases,\nhowever, _it was suppressed. The speaker had made up his mind not to\nconvert the interfering tendency into speech and then the slip of the\ntongue occurred; that is to say, the suppressed tendency obtains\nexpression against the speaker's will, in that it changes the expression\nof the intention which he permits, mixes itself with it or actually puts\nitself in its place._ This is, then, the mechanism of the tongue slip.\nFrom my point of view, I can also best harmonize the processes of the\nthird group with the mechanism here described. I need only assume that\nthese three groups are differentiated by the different degrees of\neffectiveness attending the suppression of an intention. In the first\ngroup, the intention is present and makes itself perceptible before the\nutterance of the speaker; not until then does it suffer the suppression\nfor which it indemnifies itself in the slip. In the second group the\nsuppression extends farther. The intention is no longer perceptible\nbefore the subject speaks. It is remarkable that the interfering\nintention is in no way deterred by this from taking part in the\ncausation of the slip. Through this fact, however, the explanation of\nthe procedure in the third group is simplified for us. I shall be so\nbold as to assume that in the error a tendency can manifest itself which\nhas been suppressed for even a longer time, perhaps a very long time,\nwhich does not become perceptible and which, therefore, cannot be\ndirectly denied by the speaker. But leave the problem of the third\ngroup; from the observation of the other cases, you most draw the\nconclusion that _the suppression of the existing intention to say\nsomething is the indispensable condition of the occurrence of a slip_.\nWe may now claim that we have made further progress in understanding\nerrors. We know not only that they are psychic acts, in which we can\nrecognize meaning and purpose, and that they arise through the mutual\ninterference of two different intentions, but, in addition, we know that\none of these intentions must have undergone a certain suppression in\norder to be able to manifest itself through interference with the other.\nThe interfering intention must itself first be interfered with before it\ncan become interfering. Naturally, a complete explanation of the\nphenomena which we call errors is not attained to by this. We\nimmediately see further questions arising, and suspect in general that\nthere will be more occasions for new questions as we progress further.\nWe might, for example, ask why the matter does not proceed much more\nsimply. If there is an existing purpose to suppress a certain tendency\ninstead of giving it expression, then this suppression should be so\nsuccessful that nothing at all of the latter comes to light; or it could\neven fail, so that the suppressed tendency attains to full expression.\nBut errors are compromise formations. They mean some success and some\nfailure for each of the two purposes. The endangered intention is\nneither completely suppressed nor does it, without regard to individual\ncases, come through wholly intact. We can imagine that special\nconditions must be existent for the occurrence of such interference or\ncompromise formations, but then we cannot even conjecture what sort they\nmay be. Nor do I believe that we can uncover these unknown circumstances\nthrough further penetration into the study of errors. Rather will it be\nnecessary thoroughly to examine other obscure fields of psychic life.\nOnly the analogies which we there encounter can give us the courage to\ndraw those assumptions which are requisite to a more fundamental\nelucidation of errors. And one thing more. Even working with small\nsigns, as we have constantly been in the habit of doing in this\nprovince, brings its dangers with it. There is a mental disease,\ncombined paranoia, in which the utilization of such small signs is\npracticed without restriction and I naturally would not wish to give it\nas my opinion that these conclusions, built up on this basis, are\ncorrect throughout. We can be protected from such dangers only by the\nbroad basis of our observations, by the repetition of similar\nimpressions from the most varied fields of psychic life.\nWe will therefore leave the analysis of errors here. But may I remind\nyou of one thing more: keep in mind, as a prototype, the manner in which\nwe have treated these phenomena. You can see from these examples what\nthe purposes of our psychology are. We do not wish merely to describe\nthe phenomena and to classify them, but to comprehend them as signs of a\nplay of forces in the psychic, as expressions of tendencies striving to\nan end, tendencies which work together or against one another. We seek a\ndynamic conception of psychic phenomena. The perceived phenomena must,\nin our conception, give way to those strivings whose existence is only\nassumed.\nHence we will not go deeper into the problem of errors, but we can still\nundertake an expedition through the length of this field, in which we\nwill reencounter things familiar to us, and will come upon the tracks of\nsome that are new. In so doing we will keep to the division which we\nmade in the beginning of our study, of the three groups of tongue slips,\nwith the related forms of pen slips, misreadings, mishearings,\nforgetfulness with its subdivisions according to the forgotten object\n(proper names, foreign words, projects, impressions), and the other\nfaults of mistaking, mislaying and losing objects. Errors, in so far as\nthey come into our consideration, are grouped in part with\nforgetfulness, in part with mistakes.\nWe have already spoken in such detail of tongue slips, and yet there are\nstill several points to be added. Linked with tongue slips are smaller\neffective phenomena which are not entirely without interest. No one\nlikes to make a slip of the tongue; often one fails to hear his own\nslip, though never that of another. Tongue slips are in a certain sense\ninfectious; it is not at all easy to discuss tongue slips without\nfalling into slips of the tongue oneself. The most trifling forms of\ntongue slips are just the ones which have no particular illumination to\nthrow on the hidden psychic processes, but are nevertheless not\ndifficult to penetrate in their motivation. If, for example, anyone\npronounces a long vowel as a short, in consequence of an interference no\nmatter how motivated, he will for that reason soon after lengthen a\nshort vowel and commit a new slip in compensation for the earlier one.\nThe same thing occurs when one has pronounced a double vowel unclearly\nand hastily; for example, an \"eu\" or an \"oi\" as \"ei.\" The speaker tries\nto correct it by changing a subsequent \"ei\" or \"eu\" to \"oi.\" In this\nconduct the determining factor seems to be a certain consideration for\nthe hearer, who is not to think that it is immaterial to the speaker how\nhe treats his mother tongue. The second, compensating distortion\nactually has the purpose of making the hearer conscious of the first,\nand of assuring him that it also did not escape the speaker. The most\nfrequent and most trifling cases of slips consist in the contractions\nand foresoundings which show themselves in inconspicuous parts of\nspeech. One's tongue slips in a longer speech to such an extent that the\nlast word of the intended speech is said too soon. That gives the\nimpression of a certain impatience to be finished with the sentence and\ngives proof in general of a certain resistance to communicating this\nsentence or speech as a whole. Thus we come to borderline cases in which\nthe differences between the psychoanalytic and the common physiological\nconception of tongue slips are blended. We assume that in these cases\nthere is a tendency which interferes with the intention of the speech.\nBut it can only announce that it is present, and not what its own\nintention is. The interference which it occasions then follows some\nsound influences or associative relationship, and may be considered as a\ndistraction of attention from the intended speech. But neither this\ndisturbance of attention nor the associative tendency which has been\nactivated, strikes the essence of the process. This hints, however, at\nthe existence of an intention which interferes with the purposed speech,\nan intention whose nature cannot (as is possible in all the more\npronounced cases of tongue slips) this time be guessed from its effects.\nSlips of the pen, to which I now turn, are in agreement with those of\nthe tongue to the extent that we need expect to gain no new points of\nview from them. Perhaps we will be content with a small gleaning. Those\nvery common little slips of the pen--contractions, anticipations of\nlater words, particularly of the last words--again point to a general\ndistaste for writing, and to an impatience to be done; the pronounced\neffects of pen slips permit the nature and purpose of the interfering\ntendency to be recognized. One knows in general that if one finds a\nslip of the pen in a letter everything was not as usual with the writer.\nWhat was the matter one cannot always establish. The pen slip is\nfrequently as little noticed by the person who makes it as the tongue\nslip. The following observation is striking: There are some persons who\nhave the habit of always rereading a letter they have written before\nsending it. Others do not do so. But if the latter make an exception and\nreread the letter, they always have the opportunity of finding and\ncorrecting a conspicuous pen slip. How can that be explained? This looks\nas if these persons knew that they had made a slip of the pen while\nwriting the letter. Shall we really believe that such is the case?\nThere is an interesting problem linked with the practical significance\nof the pen slip. You may recall the case of the murderer H., who made a\npractice of obtaining cultures of the most dangerous disease germs from\nscientific institutions, by pretending to be a bacteriologist, and who\nused these cultures to get his close relatives out of the way in this\nmost modern fashion. This man once complained to the authorities of such\nan institution about the ineffectiveness of the culture which had been\nsent to him, but committed a pen slip and instead of the words, \"in my\nattempts on mice and guinea pigs,\" was plainly written, \"in my attempts\non people.\"[20] This slip even attracted the attention of the doctors at\nthe institution, but so far as I know, they drew no conclusion from it.\nNow what do you think? Might not the doctors better have accepted the\nslip as a confession and instituted an investigation through which the\nmurderer's handiwork would have been blocked in time? In this case was\nnot ignorance of our conception of errors to blame for an omission of\npractical importance? Well, I am inclined to think that such a slip\nwould surely seem very suspicious to me, but a fact of great importance\nstands in the way of its utilization as a confession. The thing is not\nso simple. The pen slip is surely an indication, but by itself it would\nnot have been sufficient to instigate an investigation. That the man is\npreoccupied with the thought of infecting human beings, the slip\ncertainly does betray, but it does not make it possible to decide\nwhether this thought has the value of a clear plan of injury or merely\nof a phantasy having no practical consequence. It is even possible that\nthe person who made such a slip will deny this phantasy with the best\nsubjective justification and will reject it as something entirely alien\nto him. Later, when we give our attention to the difference between\npsychic and material reality, you will understand these possibilities\neven better. Yet this is again a case in which an error later attained\nunsuspected significance.\nIn misreading, we encounter a psychic situation which is clearly\ndifferentiated from that of the tongue slips or pen slips. The one of\nthe two rival tendencies is here replaced by a sensory stimulus and\nperhaps for that reason is less resistant. What one is reading is not a\nproduction of one's own psychic activity, as is something which one\nintends to write. In a large majority of cases, therefore, the\nmisreading consists in a complete substitution. One substitutes another\nword for the word to be read, and there need be no connection in meaning\nbetween the text and the product of the misreading. In general, the slip\nis based upon a word resemblance. Lichtenberg's example of reading\n\"_Agamemnon_\" for \"_angenommen_\"[21] is the best of this group. If one\nwishes to discover the interfering tendency which causes the misreading,\none may completely ignore the misread text and can begin the analytic\ninvestigation with the two questions: What is the first idea that occurs\nin free association to the product of the misreading, and, in what\nsituation did the misreading occur? Now and then a knowledge of the\nlatter suffices by itself to explain the misreading. Take, for example,\nthe individual who, distressed by certain needs, wanders about in a\nstrange city and reads the word \"_Closethaus_\" on a large sign on the\nfirst floor of a house. He has just time to be surprised at the fact\nthat the sign has been nailed so high up when he discovers that,\naccurately observed, the sign reads \"_Corset-haus_.\" In other cases the\nmisreadings which are independent of the text require a penetrating\nanalysis which cannot be accomplished without practice and confidence in\nthe psychoanalytic technique. But generally it is not a matter of much\ndifficulty to obtain the elucidation of a misreading. The substituted\nword, as in the example, \"_Agamemnon_,\" betrays without more ado the\nthought sequence from which the interference results. In war times, for\ninstance, it is very common for one to read into everything which\ncontains a similar word structure, the names of the cities, generals and\nmilitary expressions which are constantly buzzing around us. In this\nway, whatever interests and preoccupies one puts itself in the place of\nthat which is foreign or uninteresting. The after-effects of thoughts\nblur the new perceptions.\nThere are other types of misreadings, in which the text itself arouses\nthe disturbing tendency, by means of which it is then most often changed\ninto its opposite. One reads something which is undesired; analysis then\nconvinces one that an intensive wish to reject what has been read should\nbe made responsible for the alteration.\nIn the first mentioned and more frequent cases of misreading, two\nfactors are neglected to which we gave an important role in the\nmechanism of errors: the conflict of two tendencies and the suppression\nof one which then indemnifies itself by producing the error. Not that\nanything like the opposite occurs in misreading, but the importunity of\nthe idea content which leads to misreading is nevertheless much more\nconspicuous than the suppression to which the latter may previously have\nbeen subjected. Just these two factors are most tangibly apparent in the\nvarious situations of errors of forgetfulness.\nForgetting plans is actually uniform in meaning; its interpretation is,\nas we have heard, not denied even by the layman. The tendency\ninterfering with the plan is always an antithetical intention, an\nunwillingness concerning which we need only discover why it does not\ncome to expression in a different and less disguised manner. But the\nexistence of this unwillingness is not to be doubted. Sometimes it is\npossible even to guess something of the motives which make it necessary\nfor this unwillingness to disguise itself, and it always achieves its\npurpose by the error resulting from the concealment, while its rejection\nwould be certain were it to present itself as open contradiction. If an\nimportant change in the psychic situation occurs between the formulation\nof the plan and its execution, in consequence of which the execution of\nthe plan does not come into question, then the fact that the plan was\nforgotten is no longer in the class of errors. One is no longer\nsurprised at it, and one understands that it would have been superfluous\nto have remembered the plan; it was then permanently or temporarily\neffaced. Forgetting a plan can be called an error only when we have no\nreason to believe there was such an interruption.\nThe cases of forgetting plans are in general so uniform and transparent\nthat they do not interest us in our investigation. There are two points,\nhowever, from which we can learn something new. We have said that\nforgetting, that is, the non-execution of a plan, points to an antipathy\ntoward it. This certainly holds, but, according to the results of our\ninvestigations, the antipathy may be of two sorts, direct and indirect.\nWhat is meant by the latter can best be explained by one or two\nexamples. If a patron forgets to say a good word for his protege to a\nthird person, it may be because the patron is not really very much\ninterested in the protege, therefore, has no great inclination to\ncommend him. It is, at any rate, in this sense that the protege will\nconstrue his patron's forgetfulness. But the matter may be more\ncomplicated. The patron's antipathy to the execution of the plan may\noriginate in another quarter and fasten upon quite a different point. It\nneed not have anything to do with the protege, but may be directed\ntoward the third person to whom the good word was to have been said.\nThus, you see what doubts here confront the practical application of our\ninterpretation. The protege, despite a correct interpretation of the\nforgetfulness, stands in danger of becoming too suspicious, and of doing\nhis patron a grave injustice. Or, if an individual forgets a rendezvous\nwhich he has made, and which he had resolved to keep, the most frequent\nbasis will certainly be the direct aversion to encountering this person.\nBut analysis might here supply the information that the interfering\nintention was not directed against that person, but against the place in\nwhich they were to have met, and which was avoided because of a painful\nmemory associated with it. Or, if one forgets to mail a letter, the\ncounter-intention may be directed against the content of that letter,\nyet this does not in any way exclude the possibility that the letter is\nharmless in itself, and only subject to the counter-intention because\nsomething about it reminds the writer of another letter written\npreviously, which, in fact, did afford a basis for the antipathy. One\ncan say in such a case that the antipathy has here transferred itself\nfrom that former letter where it was justified to the present one in\nwhich it really has no meaning. Thus you see that one must always\nexercise restraint and caution in the application of interpretations,\neven though the interpretations are justified. That which is\npsychologically equivalent may nevertheless in practice be very\nambiguous.\nPhenomena such as these will seem very unusual to you. Perhaps you are\ninclined to assume that the \"indirect\" antipathy is enough to\ncharacterize the incident as pathological. Yet I can assure you that it\nalso occurs in a normal and healthy setting. I am in no way willing to\nadmit the unreliability of our analytic interpretation. After all, the\nabove-discussed ambiguity of plan-forgetting exists only so long as we\nhave not attempted an analysis of the case, and are interpreting it only\non the basis of our general suppositions. When we analyze the person in\nquestion, we discover with sufficient certainty in each case whether or\nnot it is a direct antipathy, or what its origin is otherwise.\nA second point is the following: when we find in a large majority of\ncases that the forgetting of a plan goes back to an antipathy, we gain\ncourage to extend this solution to another series of cases in which the\nanalyzed person does not confirm, but denies, the antipathy which we\ninferred. Take as an example the exceedingly frequent incidents of\nforgetting to return books which one has borrowed, or forgetting to pay\none's bills or debts. We will be so bold as to accuse the individual in\nquestion of intending to keep the books and not to pay the debts, while\nhe will deny such an intention but will not be in a position to give us\nany other explanation of his conduct. Thereupon we insist that he has\nthe intention, only he knows nothing about it; all we need for our\ninference is to have the intention betray itself through the effect of\nthe forgetfulness. The subject may then repeat that he had merely\nforgotten it. You now recognize the situation as one in which we once\nbefore found ourselves. If we wish to be consistent in our\ninterpretation, an interpretation which has been proved as manifold as\nit is justified, we will be unavoidably forced to the conclusion that\nthere are tendencies in a human being which can become effective without\nhis being conscious of them. By so doing, however, we place ourselves in\nopposition to all the views which prevail in daily life and in\npsychology.\nForgetting proper names and foreign names as well as foreign words can\nbe traced in the same manner to a counter-intention which aims either\ndirectly or indirectly at the name in question. I have already given you\nan example of such direct antipathy. The indirect causation, however, is\nparticularly frequent and generally necessitates careful analysis for\nits determination. Thus, for example, in war times which force us to\nsacrifice so many of our former inclinations, the ability to recall\nproper names also suffers severely in consequence of the most peculiar\nconnections. A short time ago it happened that I could not reproduce the\nname of that harmless Moravian city of Bisenz, and analysis showed that\nno direct dislike was to blame, but rather the sound resemblance to the\nname of the Bisenzi palace in Orrieto, in which I used to wish I might\nlive. As a motive for the antagonism to remembering the name, we here\nencounter for the first time a principle which will later disclose to us\nits whole tremendous significance in the causation of neurotic symptoms,\nviz., the aversion on the part of the memory to remembering anything\nwhich is connected with unpleasant experience and which would revive\nthis unpleasantness by a reproduction. This intention of avoiding\nunpleasantness in recollections of other psychic acts, the psychic\nflight from unpleasantness, we may recognize as the ultimate effective\nmotive not only for the forgetting of names, but also for many other\nerrors, such as omissions of action, etc.\nForgetting names does, however, seem to be especially facilitated\npsycho-physiologically and therefore also occurs in cases in which the\ninterference of an unpleasantness-motive cannot be established. If\nanyone once has a tendency to forget names, you can establish by\nanalytical investigation that he not only loses names because he himself\ndoes not like them, or because they remind him of something he does not\nlike, but also because the same name in his mind belongs to another\nchain of associations, with which he has more intimate relations. The\nname is anchored there, as it were, and denied to the other associations\nactivated at the moment. If you will recall the tricks of mnemonic\ntechnique you will ascertain with some surprise that one forgets names\nin consequence of the same associations which one otherwise purposely\nforms in order to save them from being forgotten. The most conspicuous\nexample of this is afforded by proper names of persons, which\nconceivably enough must have very different psychic values for different\npeople. For example, take a first name, such as Theodore. To one of you\nit will mean nothing special, to another it means the name of his\nfather, brother, friend, or his own name. Analytic experience will then\nshow you that the first person is not in danger of forgetting that a\ncertain stranger bears this name, while the latter will be constantly\ninclined to withhold from the stranger this name which seems reserved\nfor intimate relationships. Let us now assume that this associative\ninhibition can come into contact with the operation of the\nunpleasantness-principle, and in addition with an indirect mechanism,\nand you will be in a position to form a correct picture of the\ncomplexity of causation of this temporary name-forgetting. An adequate\nanalysis that does justice to the facts, however, will completely\ndisclose these complications.\nForgetting impressions and experiences shows the working of the tendency\nto keep unpleasantness from recollection much more clearly and\nconclusively than does the forgetting of names. It does not, of course,\nbelong in its entirety to the category of errors, but only in so far as\nit seems to us conspicuous and unjustified, measured by the measuring\nstick of our accustomed conception--thus, for example, where the\nforgetfulness strikes fresh or important impressions or impressions\nwhose loss tears a hole in the otherwise well-remembered sequence. Why\nand how it is in general that we forget, particularly why and how we\nforget experiences which have surely left the deepest impressions, such\nas the incidents of our first years of childhood, is quite a different\nproblem, in which the defense against unpleasant associations plays a\ncertain role but is far from explaining everything. That unpleasant\nimpressions are easily forgotten is an indubitable fact. Various\npsychologists have observed it, and the great Darwin was so struck by it\nthat he made the \"golden rule\" for himself of writing down with\nparticular care observations which seemed unfavorable to his theory,\nsince he had convinced himself that they were just the ones which would\nnot stick in his memory.\nThose who hear for the first time of this principle of defense against\nunpleasant recollections by means of forgetting, seldom fail to raise\nthe objection that they, on the contrary, have had the experience that\njust the painful is hard to forget, inasmuch as it always comes back to\nmind to torture the person against his will--as, for example, the\nrecollection of an insult or humiliation. This fact is also correct, but\nthe objection is not valid. It is important that one begin betimes to\nreckon with the fact that the psychic life is the arena of the struggles\nand exercises of antagonistic tendencies, or, to express it in\nnon-dynamic terminology, that it consists of contradictions and paired\nantagonisms. Information concerning one specific tendency is of no avail\nfor the exclusion of its opposite; there is room for both of them. It\ndepends only on how the opposites react upon each other, what effects\nwill proceed from the one and what from the other.\nLosing and mislaying objects is of especial interest to us because of\nthe ambiguity and the multiplicity of tendencies in whose services the\nerrors may act. The common element in all cases is this, that one wished\nto lose something. The reasons and purposes thereof vary. One loses an\nobject when it has become damaged, when one intends to replace it with a\nbetter one, when one has ceased to like it, when it came from a person\nwhose relations to one have become strained, or when it was obtained\nunder circumstances of which one no longer wishes to think. The same\npurpose may be served by letting the object fall, be damaged or broken.\nIn the life of society it is said to have been found that unwelcome and\nillegitimate children are much more often frail than those born in\nwedlock. To reach this result we do not need the coarse technique of the\nso-called angel-maker. A certain remissness in the care of the child is\nsaid to suffice amply. In the preservation of objects, the case might\neasily be the same as with the children.\nBut things may be singled out for loss without their having forfeited\nany of their value, namely, when there exists the intention to sacrifice\nsomething to fate in order to ward off some other dreaded loss. Such\nexorcisings of fate are, according to the findings of analysis, still\nvery frequent among us; therefore, the loss of things is often a\nvoluntary sacrifice. In the same way losing may serve the purposes of\nobstinacy or self-punishment. In short, the more distant motivation of\nthe tendency to get rid of a thing oneself by means of losing it is not\noverlooked.\nMistakes, like other errors, are often used to fulfill wishes which one\nought to deny oneself. The purpose is thus masked as fortunate\naccident; for instance, one of our friends once took the train to make a\ncall in the suburbs, despite the clearest antipathy to so doing, and\nthen, in changing cars, made the mistake of getting into the train which\ntook him back to the city. Or, if on a trip one absolutely wants to make\na longer stay at a half-way station, one is apt to overlook or miss\ncertain connections, so that he is forced to make the desired\ninterruption to the trip. Or, as once happened to a patient of mine whom\nI had forbidden to call up his fiancee on the telephone, \"by mistake\"\nand \"absent-mindedly\" he asked for a wrong number when he wanted to\ntelephone to me, so that he was suddenly connected with the lady. A\npretty example and one of practical significance in making a direct\nmistake is the observation of an engineer at a preliminary hearing in a\ndamage suit:\n\"Some time ago I worked with several colleagues in the laboratory of a\nhigh school on a series of complicated elasticity experiments, a piece\nof work which we had undertaken voluntarily but which began to take more\ntime than we had expected. One day as I went into the laboratory with my\ncolleague F., the latter remarked how unpleasant it was to him to lose\nso much time that day, since he had so much to do at home. I could not\nhelp agreeing with him, and remarked half jokingly, alluding to an\nincident of the previous week: 'Let's hope that the machine gives out\nagain so that we can stop work and go home early.'\n\"In the division of labor it happened that F. was given the regulation\nof the valve of the press, that is to say, he was, by means of a\ncautious opening of the valve, to let the liquid pressure from the\naccumulator flow slowly into the cylinder of the hydraulic press. The\nman who was directing the job stood by the manometer (pressure gauge)\nand when the right pressure had been reached called out in a loud voice:\n'Stop.' At this command F. seized the valve and turned with all his\nmight--to the left! (All valves, without exception, close to the right.)\nThereby the whole pressure of the accumulator suddenly became effective\nin the press, a strain for which the connecting pipes are not designed,\nso that a connecting pipe immediately burst--quite a harmless defect,\nbut one which nevertheless forced us to drop work for the day and go\nhome.\n\"It is characteristic, by the way, that some time afterward when we were\ndiscussing this occurrence, my friend F. had no recollection whatever\nof my remark, which I could recall with certainty.\"\nFrom this point you may reach the conjecture that it is not harmless\naccident which makes the hands of your domestics such dangerous enemies\nto your household property. But you can also raise the question whether\nit is always an accident when one damages himself and exposes his own\nperson to danger. There are interests the value of which you will\npresently be able to test by means of the analysis of observations.\nLadies and gentlemen, this is far from being all that might be said\nabout errors. There is indeed much left to investigate and to discuss.\nBut I am satisfied if, from our investigations to date, your previous\nviews are somewhat shaken and if you have acquired a certain degree of\nliberality in the acceptance of new ones. For the rest, I must content\nmyself with leaving you face to face with an unclear condition of\naffairs. We cannot prove all our axioms by the study of errors and,\nindeed, are by no means solely dependent on this material. The great\nvalue of errors for our purpose lies in the fact that they are very\nfrequent phenomena that can easily be observed on oneself and the\noccurrence of which do not require a pathological condition. I should\nlike to mention just one more of your unanswered questions before\nconcluding: \"If, as we have seen in many examples, people come so close\nto understanding errors and so often act as though they penetrated their\nmeaning, how is it possible that they can so generally consider them\naccidental, senseless and meaningless, and can so energetically oppose\ntheir psychoanalytic elucidation?\"\nYou are right; that is conspicuous and demands an explanation. I shall\nnot give this explanation to you, however, but shall guide you slowly to\nthe connecting links from which the explanation will force itself upon\nyou without any aid from me.\nII\nTHE DREAM\nFIFTH LECTURE\nTHE DREAM\n_Difficulties and Preliminary Approach_\nOne day the discovery was made that the disease symptoms of certain\nnervous patients have a meaning.[22] Thereupon the psychoanalytic method\nof therapy was founded. In this treatment it happened that the patients\nalso presented dreams in place of their symptoms. Herewith originated\nthe conjecture that these dreams also have a meaning.\nWe will not, however, pursue this historical path, but enter upon the\nopposite one. We wish to discover the meaning of dreams as preparation\nfor the study of the neuroses. This inversion is justified, for the\nstudy of dreams is not only the best preparation for that of the\nneuroses, but the dream itself is also a neurotic symptom, and in fact\none which possesses for us the incalculable advantage of occurring in\nall normals. Indeed, if all human beings were well and would dream, we\ncould gain from their dreams almost all the insight to which the study\nof the neuroses has led.\nThus it is that the dream becomes the object of psychoanalytic\nresearch--again an ordinary, little-considered phenomenon, apparently of\nno practical value, like the errors with which, indeed, it shares the\ncharacter of occurring in normals. But otherwise the conditions are\nrather less favorable for our work. Errors had been neglected only by\nscience, which had paid little attention to them; but at least it was no\ndisgrace to occupy one's self with them. People said there are indeed\nmore important things, but perhaps something may come of it.\nPreoccupation with the dream, however, is not merely impractical and\nsuperfluous, but actually ignominious; it carries the odium of the\nunscientific, awakens the suspicion of a personal leaning towards\nmysticism. The idea of a physician busying himself with dreams when even\nin neuropathology and psychiatry there are matters so much more\nserious--tumors the size of apples which incapacitate the organ of the\npsyche, hemorrhages, and chronic inflammations in which one can\ndemonstrate changes in the tissues under the microscope! No, the dream\nis much too trifling an object, and unworthy of Science.\nAnd besides, it is a condition which in itself defies all the\nrequirements of exact research--in dream investigation one is not even\nsure of one's object. A delusion, for example, presents itself in clear\nand definite outlines. \"I am the Emperor of China,\" says the patient\naloud. But the dream? It generally cannot be related at all. If anyone\nrelates a dream, has he any guarantee that he has told it correctly, and\nnot changed it during the telling, or invented an addition which was\nforced by the indefiniteness of his recollection? Most dreams cannot be\nremembered at all, are forgotten except for small fragments. And upon\nthe interpretation of such material shall a scientific psychology or\nmethod of treatment for patients be based?\nA certain excess in judgment may make us suspicious. The objections to\nthe dream as an object of research obviously go too far. The question of\ninsignificance we have already had to deal with in discussing errors. We\nsaid to ourselves that important matters may manifest themselves through\nsmall signs. As concerns the indefiniteness of the dream, it is after\nall a characteristic like any other. One cannot prescribe the\ncharacteristics of an object. Moreover, there are clear and definite\ndreams. And there are other objects of psychiatric research which suffer\nfrom the same trait of indefiniteness, e.g., many compulsion ideas, with\nwhich even respectable and esteemed psychiatrists have occupied\nthemselves. I might recall the last case which occurred in my practice.\nThe patient introduced himself to me with the words, \"I have a certain\nfeeling as though I had harmed or had wished to harm some living\nthing--a child?--no, more probably a dog--perhaps pushed it off a\nbridge--or something else.\" We can overcome to some degree the\ndifficulty of uncertain recollection in the dream if we determine that\nexactly what the dreamer tells us is to be taken as his dream, without\nregard to anything which he has forgotten or may have changed in\nrecollection. And finally, one cannot make so general an assertion as\nthat the dream is an unimportant thing. We know from our own experience\nthat the mood in which one wakes up after a dream may continue\nthroughout the whole day. Cases have been observed by physicians in\nwhich a psychosis begins with a dream and holds to a delusion which\noriginated in it. It is related of historical personages that they drew\ntheir inspiration for important deeds from dreams. So we may ask whence\ncomes the contempt of scientific circles for the dream?\nI think it is the reaction to their over-estimation in former times.\nReconstruction of the past is notoriously difficult, but this much we\nmay assume with certainty--if you will permit me the jest--that our\nancestors of 3000 years ago and more, dreamed much in the way we do. As\nfar as we know, all ancient peoples attached great importance to dreams\nand considered them of practical value. They drew omens for the future\nfrom dreams, sought premonitions in them. In those days, to the Greeks\nand all Orientals, a campaign without dream interpreters must have been\nas impossible as a campaign without an aviation scout to-day. When\nAlexander the Great undertook his campaign of conquests, the most famous\ndream interpreters were in attendance. The city of Tyrus, which was then\nstill situated on an island, put up so fierce a resistance that\nAlexander considered the idea of raising the siege. Then he dreamed one\nnight of a satyr dancing as if in triumph; and when he laid his dream\nbefore his interpreters he received the information that the victory\nover the city had been announced to him. He ordered the attack and took\nTyrus. Among the Etruscans and the Romans other methods of discovering\nthe future were in use, but the interpretation of dreams was practical\nand esteemed during the entire Hellenic-Roman period. Of the literature\ndealing with the topic at least the chief work has been preserved to us,\nnamely, the book of Artemidoros of Daldis, who is supposed to have lived\nduring the lifetime of the Emperor Hadrian. How it happened subsequently\nthat the art of dream interpretation was lost and the dream fell into\ndiscredit, I cannot tell you. Enlightenment cannot have had much part in\nit, for the Dark Ages faithfully preserved things far more absurd than\nthe ancient dream interpretation. The fact is, the interest in dreams\ngradually deteriorated into superstition, and could assert itself only\namong the ignorant. The latest misuse of dream interpretation in our day\nstill tries to discover in dreams the numbers which are going to be\ndrawn in the small lottery. On the other hand, the exact science of\nto-day has repeatedly dealt with dreams, but always only with the\npurpose of applying its physiological theories to the dream. By\nphysicians, of course, the dream was considered as a non-psychic act, as\nthe manifestation of somatic irritations in the psychic life. Binz\n(1876) pronounced the dream \"a bodily process, in all cases useless, in\nmany actually pathological, above which the world-soul and immortality\nare raised as high as the blue ether over the weed-grown sands of the\nlowest plain.\" Maury compared it with the irregular twitchings of St.\nVitus' Dance in contrast to the co-ordinated movements of the normal\nperson. An old comparison makes the content of the dream analogous to\nthe tones which the \"ten fingers of a musically illiterate person would\nbring forth if they ran over the keys of the instrument.\"\nInterpretation means finding a hidden meaning. There can be no question\nof interpretation in such an estimation of the dream process. Look up\nthe description of the dream in Wundt, Jodl and other newer\nphilosophers. You will find an enumeration of the deviations of dream\nlife from waking thought, in a sense disparaging to the dream. The\ndescription points out the disintegration of association, the suspension\nof the critical faculty, the elimination of all knowledge, and other\nsigns of diminished activity. The only valuable contribution to the\nknowledge of the dream which we owe to exact science pertains to the\ninfluence of bodily stimuli, operative during sleep, on the content of\nthe dream. There are two thick volumes of experimental researches on\ndreams by the recently deceased Norwegian author, J. Mourly Vold,\n(translated into German in 1910 and 1912), which deal almost solely with\nthe consequences of changes in the position of the limbs. They are\nrecommended as the prototype of exact dream research. Now can you\nimagine what exact science would say if it discovered that we wish to\nattempt to find the meaning of dreams? It may be it has already said it,\nbut we will not allow ourselves to be frightened off. If errors can have\na meaning, the dream can, too, and errors in many cases have a meaning\nwhich has escaped exact science. Let us confess to sharing the prejudice\nof the ancients and the common people, and let us follow in the\nfootsteps of the ancient dream interpreters.\nFirst of all, we must orient ourselves in our task, and take a bird's\neye view of our field. What is a dream? It is difficult to say in one\nsentence. But we do not want to attempt any definition where a reference\nto the material with which everyone is familiar suffices. Yet we ought\nto select the essential element of the dream. How can that be found?\nThere are such monstrous differences within the boundary which encloses\nour province, differences in every direction. The essential thing will\nvery probably be that which we can show to be common to all dreams.\nWell, the first thing which is common to all dreams is that we are\nasleep during their occurrence. The dream is apparently the psychic life\nduring sleep, which has certain resemblances to that of the waking\ncondition, and on the other hand is distinguished from it by important\ndifferences. That was noted even in Aristotle's definition. Perhaps\nthere are other connections obtaining between the dream and sleep. One\ncan be awakened by a dream, one frequently has a dream when he wakes\nspontaneously or is forcibly awakened from sleep. The dream then seems\nto be an intermediate condition between sleeping and waking. Thus we are\nreferred to the problem of sleep. What, then, is sleep?\nThat is a physiological or biological problem concerning which there is\nstill much controversy. We can form no decision on the point, but I\nthink we may attempt a psychological characterization of sleep. Sleep is\na condition in which I wish to have nothing to do with the external\nworld, and have withdrawn my interest from it. I put myself to sleep by\nwithdrawing myself from the external world and by holding off its\nstimuli. I also go to sleep when I am fatigued by the external world.\nThus, by going to sleep, I say to the external world, \"Leave me in\npeace, for I wish to sleep.\" Conversely, the child says, \"I won't go to\nbed yet, I am not tired, I want to have some more fun.\" The biological\nintention of sleep thus seems to be recuperation; its psychological\ncharacter, the suspension of interest in the external world. Our\nrelation to the world into which we came so unwillingly, seems to\ninclude the fact that we cannot endure it without interruption. For this\nreason we revert from time to time to the pre-natal existence, that is,\nto the intra-uterine existence. At least we create for ourselves\nconditions quite similar to those obtaining at that time--warmth,\ndarkness and the absence of stimuli. Some of us even roll ourselves\ninto tight packages and assume in sleep a posture very similar to the\nintra-uterine posture. It seems as if the world did not wholly possess\nus adults, it has only two-thirds of our life, we are still one-third\nunborn. Each awakening in the morning is then like a new birth. We also\nspeak of the condition after sleep with the words, \"I feel as though I\nhad been born anew,\" by which we probably form a very erroneous idea of\nthe general feeling of the newly born. It may be assumed that the\nlatter, on the contrary, feel very uncomfortable. We also speak of birth\nas \"seeing the light of day.\" If that be sleep, then the dream is not on\nits program at all, rather it seems an unwelcome addition. We think,\ntoo, that dreamless sleep is the best and only normal sleep. There\nshould be no psychic activity in sleep; if the psyche stirs, then just\nto that extent have we failed to reduplicate the foetal condition;\nremainders of psychic activity could not be completely avoided. These\nremainders are the dream. Then it really does seem that the dream need\nhave no meaning. It was different in the case of errors; they were\nactivities of the waking state. But when I am asleep, have quite\nsuspended psychic activity and have suppressed all but certain of its\nremainders, then it is by no means inevitable that these remainders have\na meaning. In fact, I cannot make use of this meaning, in view of the\nfact that the rest of my psyche is asleep. This must, of course, be a\nquestion only of twitching, like spasmodic reactions, a question only of\npsychic phenomena such as follow directly upon somatic stimulation. The\ndream, therefore, appears to be the sleep-disturbing remnant of the\npsychic activity of waking life, and we may make the resolution promptly\nto abandon a theme which is so ill-adapted to psychoanalysis.\nHowever, even if the dream is superfluous, it exists nevertheless and we\nmay try to give an account of its existence. Why does not the psyche go\nto sleep? Probably because there is something which gives it no rest.\nStimuli act upon the psyche, and it must react to them. The dream,\ntherefore, is the way in which the psyche reacts to the stimuli acting\nupon it in the sleeping condition. We note here a point of approach to\nthe understanding of the dream. We can now search through different\ndreams to discover what are the stimuli which seek to disturb the sleep\nand which are reacted to with dreams. Thus far we might be said to have\ndiscovered the first common element.\nAre there other common elements? Yes, it is undeniable that there are,\nbut they are much more difficult to grasp and describe. The psychic\nprocesses of sleep, for example, have a very different character from\nthose of waking. One experiences many things in the dream, and believes\nin them, while one really has experienced nothing but perhaps the one\ndisturbing stimulus. One experiences them predominantly in visual\nimages; feelings may also be interspersed in the dream as well as\nthoughts; the other senses may also have experiences, but after all the\ndream experiences are predominantly pictures. A part of the difficulty\nof dream telling comes from the fact that we have to transpose these\npictures into words. \"I could draw it,\" the dreamer says frequently,\n\"but I don't know how to say it.\" That is not really a case of\ndiminished psychic activity, like that of the feeble-minded in\ncomparison with the highly gifted; it is something qualitatively\ndifferent, but it is difficult to say wherein the difference lies. G. T.\nFechner once hazarded the conjecture that the scene in which dreams are\nplayed is a different one from that of the waking perceptual life. To be\nsure, we do not understand this, do not know what we are to think of it,\nbut the impression of strangeness which most dreams make upon us does\nreally bear this out. The comparison of the dream activity with the\neffects of a hand untrained in music also fails at this point. The\npiano, at least, will surely answer with the same tones, even if not\nwith melodies, as soon as by accident one brushes its keys. Let us keep\nthis second common element of all dreams carefully in mind, even though\nit be not understood.\nAre there still further traits in common? I find none, and see only\ndifferences everywhere, differences indeed in the apparent length as\nwell as the definiteness of the activities, participation of effects,\ndurability, etc. All this really is not what we might expect of a\ncompulsion-driven, irresistible, convulsive defense against a stimulus.\nAs concerns the dimensions of dreams, there are very short ones which\ncontain only one picture or a few, one thought--yes, even one word\nonly--, others which are uncommonly rich in content, seem to dramatize\nwhole novels and to last very long. There are dreams which are as plain\nas an experience itself, so plain that we do not recognize them as\ndreams for a long time after waking; others which are indescribably\nweak, shadowy and vague; indeed in one and the same dream, the\noveremphasized and the scarcely comprehensible, indefinite parts may\nalternate with each other. Dreams may be quite meaningful or at least\ncoherent, yes, even witty, fantastically beautiful. Others, again, are\nconfused, as if feeble-minded, absurd, often actually mad. There are\ndreams which leave us quite cold, others in which all the effects come\nto expression--pain deep enough for tears, fear strong enough to waken\nus, astonishment, delight, etc. Dreams are generally quickly forgotten\nupon waking, or they may hold over a day to such an extent as to be\nfaintly and incompletely remembered in the evening. Others, for example,\nthe dreams of childhood, are so well preserved that they stay in the\nmemory thirty years later, like fresh experiences. Dreams, like\nindividuals, may appear a single time, and never again, or they may\nrepeat themselves unchanged in the same person, or with small\nvariations. In short, this nightly psychic activity can avail itself of\nan enormous repertoire, can indeed compass everything which the psychic\naccomplishes by day, but yet the two are not the same.\nOne might try to give an account of this many-sidedness of the dream by\nassuming that it corresponds to different intermediate stages between\nsleeping and waking, different degrees of incomplete sleep. Yes, but in\nthat case as the psyche nears the waking state, the conviction that it\nis a dream ought to increase along with the value, content and\ndistinctiveness of the dream product, and it would not happen that\nimmediately beside a distinct and sensible dream fragment a senseless\nand indistinct one would occur, to be followed again by a goodly piece\nof work. Surely the psyche could not change its degree of somnolence so\nquickly. This explanation thus avails us nothing; at any rate, it cannot\nbe accepted offhand.\nLet us, for the present, give up the idea of finding the meaning of the\ndream and try instead to clear a path to a better understanding of the\ndream by means of the elements common to all dreams. From the relation\nof dreams to the sleeping condition, we concluded that the dream is the\nreaction to a sleep-disturbing stimulus. As we have heard, this is the\nonly point upon which exact experimental psychology can come to our\nassistance; it gives us the information that stimuli applied during\nsleep appear in the dream. There have been many such investigations\ncarried out, including that of the above mentioned Mourly Vold. Indeed,\neach of us must at some time have been in a position to confirm this\nconclusion by means of occasional personal observations. I shall choose\ncertain older experiments for presentation. Maury had such experiments\nmade on his own person. He was allowed to smell cologne while dreaming.\nHe dreamed that he was in Cairo in the shop of Johann Marina Farina, and\ntherewith were linked further extravagant adventures. Or, he was\nslightly pinched in the nape of the neck; he dreamed of having a mustard\nplaster applied, and of a doctor who had treated him in childhood. Or, a\ndrop of water was poured on his forehead. He was then in Italy,\nperspired profusely, and drank the white wine of Orvieto.\nWhat strikes us about these experimentally induced dreams we may perhaps\nbe able to comprehend still more clearly in another series of stimulated\ndreams. Three dreams have been recounted by a witty observer,\nHildebrand, all of them reactions to the sound of the alarm clock:\n\"I go walking one spring morning and saunter through the green fields to\na neighboring village. There I see the inhabitants in gala attire, their\nhymn books under their arms, going church-ward in great numbers. To be\nsure, this is Sunday, and the early morning service will soon begin. I\ndecide to attend, but since I am somewhat overheated, decide to cool off\nin the cemetery surrounding the church. While I am there reading several\ninscriptions, I hear the bell ringer ascend the tower, and now see the\nlittle village church bell which is to give the signal for the beginning\nof the service. The bell hangs a good bit longer, then it begins to\nswing, and suddenly its strokes sound clear and penetrating, so clear\nand penetrating that they make an end of--my sleep. The bell-strokes,\nhowever, come from my alarm clock.\n\"A second combination. It is a clear winter day. The streets are piled\nhigh with snow. I agree to go on a sleighing party, but must wait a long\ntime before the announcement comes that the sleigh is at the door. Then\nfollow the preparations for getting in--the fur coat is put on, the\nfootwarmer dragged forth--and finally I am seated in my place. But the\ndeparture is still delayed until the reins give the waiting horses the\ntangible signal. Now they pull; the vigorously shaken bells begin their\nfamiliar Janizary music so powerfully that instantly the spider web of\nthe dream is torn. Again it is nothing but the shrill tone of the alarm\nclock.\n\"And still a third example. I see a kitchen maid walking along the\ncorridor to the dining room with some dozens of plates piled high. The\npillar of porcelain in her arms seems to me in danger of losing its\nbalance. 'Take care!' I warn her. 'The whole load will fall to the\nground.' Naturally, the inevitable retort follows: one is used to that,\netc., and I still continue to follow the passing figure with\napprehensive glances. Sure enough, at the threshold she stumbles--the\nbrittle dishes fall and rattle and crash over the floor in a thousand\npieces. But--the endless racket is not, as I soon notice, a real\nrattling, but really a ringing and with this ringing, as the awakened\nsubject now realizes, the alarm has performed its duty.\"\nThese dreams are very pretty, quite meaningful, not at all incoherent,\nas dreams usually are. We will not object to them on that score. That\nwhich is common to them all is that the situation terminates each time\nin a noise, which one recognizes upon waking up as the sound of the\nalarm. Thus we see here how a dream originates, but also discover\nsomething else. The dream does not recognize the alarm--indeed the alarm\ndoes not appear in the dream--the dream replaces the alarm sound with\nanother, it interprets the stimulus which interrupts the sleep, but\ninterprets it each time in a different way. Why? There is no answer to\nthis question, it seems to be something arbitrary. But to understand the\ndream means to be able to say why it has chosen just this sound and no\nother for the interpretation of the alarm-clock stimulus. In quite\nanalogous fashion, we must raise the objection to the Maury experiment\nthat we see well enough that the stimulus appears in the dream, but that\nwe do not discover why it appears in just this form; and that the form\ntaken by the dream does not seem to follow from the nature of the\nsleep-disturbing stimulus. Moreover, in the Maury experiments a mass of\nother dream material links itself to the direct stimulus product; as,\nfor example, the extravagant adventures in the cologne dream, for which\none can give no account.\nNow I shall ask you to consider the fact that the waking dreams offer by\nfar the best chances for determining the influence of external\nsleep-disturbing stimuli. In most of the other cases it will be more\ndifficult. One does not wake up in all dreams, and in the morning, when\none remembers the dream of the night, how can one discover the\ndisturbing stimulus which was perhaps in operation at night? I did\nsucceed once in subsequently establishing such a sound stimulus, though\nnaturally only in consequence of special circumstances. I woke up one\nmorning in a place in the Tyrolese Mountains, with the certainty that I\nhad dreamt the Pope had died. I could not explain the dream, but then my\nwife asked me: \"Did you hear the terrible bell ringing that broke out\nearly this morning from all the churches and chapels?\" No, I had heard\nnothing, my sleep is a sound one, but thanks to this information I\nunderstood my dream. How often may such stimuli incite the sleeper to\ndream without his knowing of them afterward? Perhaps often, perhaps\ninfrequently; when the stimulus can no longer be traced, one cannot be\nconvinced of its existence. Even without this fact we have given up\nevaluating the sleep disturbing stimuli, since we know that they can\nexplain only a little bit of the dream, and not the whole dream\nreaction.\nBut we need not give up this whole theory for that reason. In fact, it\ncan be extended. It is clearly immaterial through what cause the sleep\nwas disturbed and the psyche incited to dream. If the sensory stimulus\nis not always externally induced, it may be instead a stimulus\nproceeding from the internal organs, a so-called somatic stimulus. This\nconjecture is obvious, and it corresponds to the most popular conception\nof the origin of dreams. Dreams come from the stomach, one often hears\nit said. Unfortunately it may be assumed here again that the cases are\nfrequent in which the somatic stimulus which operated during the night\ncan no longer be traced after waking, and has thus become unverifiable.\nBut let us not overlook the fact that many recognized experiences\ntestify to the derivation of dreams from the somatic stimulus. It is in\ngeneral indubitable that the condition of the internal organs can\ninfluence the dream. The relation of many a dream content to a\ndistention of the bladder or to an excited condition of the genital\norgans, is so clear that it cannot be mistaken. From these transparent\ncases one can proceed to others in which, from the content of the dream,\nat least a justifiable conjecture may be made that such somatic stimuli\nhave been operative, inasmuch as there is something in this content\nwhich may be conceived as elaboration, representation, interpretation\nof the stimuli. The dream investigator Schirmer (1861) insisted with\nparticular emphasis on the derivation of the dream from organic stimuli,\nand cited several splendid examples in proof. For example, in a dream he\nsees \"two rows of beautiful boys with blonde hair and delicate\ncomplexions stand opposite each other in preparation for a fight, fall\nupon each other, seize each other, take up the old position again, and\nrepeat the whole performance;\" here the interpretation of these rows of\nboys as teeth is plausible in itself, and it seems to become convincing\nwhen after this scene the dreamer \"pulls a long tooth out of his jaws.\"\nThe interpretation of \"long, narrow, winding corridors\" as intestinal\nstimuli, seems sound and confirms Schirmer's assertion that the dream\nabove all seeks to represent the stimulus-producing organ by means of\nobjects resembling it.\nThus we must be prepared to admit that the internal stimuli may play the\nsame role in the dream as the external. Unfortunately, their evaluation\nis subject to the same difficulties as those we have already\nencountered. In a large number of cases the interpretation of the\nstimuli as somatic remains uncertain and undemonstrable. Not all dreams,\nbut only a certain portion of them, arouse the suspicion that an\ninternal organic stimulus was concerned in their causation. And finally,\nthe internal stimuli will be as little able as the external sensory\nstimuli to explain any more of the dream than pertains to the direct\nreaction to the stimuli. The origin, therefore, of the rest of the dream\nremains obscure.\nLet us, however, notice a peculiarity of dream life which becomes\napparent in the study of these effects of stimuli. The dream does not\nsimply reproduce the stimulus, but it elaborates it, it plays upon it,\nplaces it in a sequence of relationships, replaces it with something\nelse. That is a side of dream activity which must interest us because it\nmay lead us closer to the nature of the dream. If one does something\nunder stimulation, then this stimulation need not exhaust the act.\nShakespeare's _Macbeth_, for example, is a drama created on the occasion\nof the coronation of the King who for the first time wore upon his head\nthe crown symbolizing the union of three countries. But does this\nhistorical occasion cover the content of the drama, does it explain its\ngreatness and its riddle? Perhaps the external and internal stimuli,\nacting upon the sleeper, are only the incitors of the dream, of whose\nnature nothing is betrayed to us from our knowledge of that fact.\nThe other element common to dreams, their psychic peculiarity, is on the\none hand hard to comprehend, and on the other hand offers no point for\nfurther investigation. In dreams we perceive a thing for the most part\nin visual forms. Can the stimuli furnish a solution for this fact? Is it\nactually the stimulus which we experience? Why, then, is the experience\nvisual when optic stimulation incited the dream only in the rarest\ncases? Or can it be proved, when we dream speeches, that during sleep a\nconversation or sounds resembling it reached our ear? This possibility I\nventure decisively to reject.\nIf, from the common elements of dreams, we get no further, then let us\nsee what we can do with their differences. Dreams are often senseless,\nblurred, absurd; but there are some that are meaningful, sober,\nsensible. Let us see if the latter, the sensible dreams, can give some\ninformation concerning the senseless ones. I will give you the most\nrecent sensible dream which was told me, the dream of a young man: \"I\nwas promenading in Kaertner Street, met Mr. X. there, whom I accompanied\nfor a bit, and then I went to a restaurant. Two ladies and a gentleman\nseated themselves at my table. I was annoyed at this at first, and would\nnot look at them. Then I did look, and found that they were quite\npretty.\" The dreamer adds that the evening before the dream he had\nreally been in Kaertner Street, which is his usual route, and that he had\nmet Mr. X. there. The other portion of the dream is no direct\nreminiscence, but bears a certain resemblance to a previous experience.\nOr another meaningful dream, that of a lady. \"Her husband asks, 'Doesn't\nthe piano need tuning?' She: 'It is not worth while; it has to be newly\nlined.'\" This dream reproduces without much alteration a conversation\nwhich took place the day before between herself and her husband. What\ncan we learn from these two sober dreams? Nothing but that you find them\nto be reproductions of daily life or ideas connected therewith. This\nwould at least be something if it could be stated of all dreams. There\nis no question, however, that this applies to only a minority of dreams.\nIn most dreams there is no sign of any connection with the previous day,\nand no light is thereby cast on the senseless and absurd dream. We know\nonly that we have struck a new problem. We wish to know not only what it\nis that the dream says, but when, as in our examples, the dream speaks\nplainly, we also wish to know why and wherefore this recent experience\nis repeated in the dream.\nI believe you are as tired as I am of continuing attempts like these. We\nsee, after all, that the greatest interest in a problem is inadequate if\none does not know a path which will lead to a solution. Up to this point\nwe have not found this path. Experimental psychology gave us nothing but\na few very valuable pieces of information concerning the meaning of\nstimuli as dream incitors. We need expect nothing from philosophy except\nthat lately it has taken haughtily to pointing out to us the\nintellectual inferiority of our object. Let us not apply to the occult\nsciences for help. History and popular tradition tell us that the dream\nis meaningful and significant; it sees into the future. Yet that is hard\nto accept and surely not demonstrable. Thus our first efforts end in\nentire helplessness.\nUnexpectedly we get a hint from a quarter toward which we have not yet\nlooked. Colloquial usage--which after all is not an accidental thing but\nthe remnant of ancient knowledge, though it should not be made use of\nwithout caution--our speech, that is to say, recognizes something which\ncuriously enough it calls \"day dreaming.\" Day dreams are phantasies.\nThey are very common phenomena, again observable in the normal as well\nas in the sick, and access to their study is open to everyone in his own\nperson. The most conspicuous feature about these phantastic productions\nis that they have received the name \"day dreams,\" for they share neither\nof the two common elements of dreams. Their name contradicts the\nrelation to the sleeping condition, and as regards the second common\nelement, one does not experience or hallucinate anything, one only\nimagines it. One knows that it is a phantasy, that one is not seeing but\nthinking the thing. These day dreams appear in the period before\npuberty, often as early as the last years of childhood, continue into\nthe years of maturity, are then either given up or retained through\nlife. The content of these phantasies is dominated by very transparent\nmotives. They are scenes and events in which the egoistic, ambitious and\npower-seeking desires of the individual find satisfaction. With young\nmen the ambition phantasies generally prevail; in women, the erotic,\nsince they have banked their ambition on success in love. But often\nenough the erotic desire appears in the background with men too; all the\nheroic deeds and incidents are after all meant only to win the\nadmiration and favor of women. Otherwise these day dreams are very\nmanifold and undergo changing fates. They are either, each in turn,\nabandoned after a short time and replaced by a new one, or they are\nretained, spun out into long stories, and adapted to changes in daily\ncircumstances. They move with the time, so to speak, and receive from it\na \"time mark\" which testifies to the influence of the new situation.\nThey are the raw material of poetic production, for out of his day\ndreams the poet, with certain transformations, disguises and omissions,\nmakes the situations which he puts into his novels, romances and dramas.\nThe hero of the day dreams, however, is always the individual himself,\neither directly or by means of a transparent identification with\nanother.\nPerhaps day dreams bear this name because of the similarity of their\nrelation to reality, in order to indicate that their content is as\nlittle to be taken for real as that of dreams. Perhaps, however, this\nidentity of names does nevertheless rest on a characteristic of the\ndream which is still unknown to us, perhaps even one of those\ncharacteristics which we are seeking. It is possible, on the other hand,\nthat we are wrong in trying to read a meaning into this similarity of\ndesignation. Yet that can only be cleared up later.\nSIXTH LECTURE\nTHE DREAM\n_Hypothesis and Technique of Interpretation_\nWe must find a new path, a new method, in order to proceed with the\ninvestigation of the dream. I shall now make an obvious suggestion. Let\nus assume as a hypothesis for everything which follows, that _the dream\nis not a somatic but a psychic phenomenon_. You appreciate the\nsignificance of that statement, but what justification have we for\nmaking it? None; but that alone need not deter us from making it. The\nmatter stands thus: If the dream is a somatic phenomenon, it does not\nconcern us. It can be of interest to us only on the supposition that it\nis a _psychic_ phenomenon. Let us therefore work upon that assumption in\norder to see what comes of it. The result of our labor will determine\nwhether we are to hold to this assumption and whether we may, in fact,\nconsider it in turn a result. What is it that we really wish to achieve,\nto what end are we working? It is what one usually seeks to attain in\nthe sciences, an understanding of phenomena, the creation of\nrelationships between them, and ultimately, if possible, the extension\nof our control over them.\nLet us then proceed with the work on the assumption that the dream is a\npsychic phenomenon. This makes it an achievement and expression of the\ndreamer, but one that tells us nothing, one that we do not understand.\nWhat do you do when I make a statement you do not understand? You ask\nfor an explanation, do you not? Why may we not do the same thing here,\n_ask the dreamer to give us the meaning of his dream_?\nIf you will remember, we were in this same situation once before. It was\nwhen we were investigating errors, a case of a slip of the tongue.\nSomeone said: \"_Da sind dinge zum vorschwein gekommen_,\" whereupon we\nasked--no, luckily, not we, but others, persons in no way associated\nwith psychoanalysis--these persons asked him what he meant by this\nunintelligible talk. He immediately answered that he had intended to say\n\"_Das waren schweinereien_,\" but that he had suppressed this intention,\nin favor of the other, more gentle \"_Da sind dinge zum vorschein\ngekommen_.\"[23] I explained to you at the time that this inquiry was\ntypical of every psychoanalytical investigation, and now you understand\nthat psychoanalysis follows the technique, as far as possible, of having\nthe subjects themselves discover the solutions of their riddles. The\ndreamer himself, then, is to tell us the meaning of his dream.\nIt is common knowledge, however, that this is not such an easy matter\nwith dreams. In the case of slips, our method worked in a number of\ncases, but we encountered some where the subject did not wish to say\nanything--in fact, indignantly rejected the answer that we suggested.\nInstances of the first method are entirely lacking in the case of\ndreams; the dreamer always says he knows nothing. He cannot deny our\ninterpretation, for we have none. Shall we then give up the attempt?\nSince he knows nothing and we know nothing and a third person surely\nknows nothing, it looks as though there were no possibility of\ndiscovering anything. If you wish, discontinue the investigation. But if\nyou are of another mind, you can accompany me on the way. For I assure\nyou, it is very possible, in fact, probable, that the dreamer does know\nwhat his dream means, but does _not know that he knows, and therefore\nbelieves he does not know_.\nYou will point out to me that I am again making an assumption, the\nsecond in this short discourse, and that I am greatly reducing the\ncredibility of my claim. On the assumption that the dream is a psychic\nphenomenon, on the further assumption that there are unconscious things\nin man which he knows without knowing that he knows, etc.--we need only\nrealize clearly the intrinsic improbability of each of these two\nassumptions, and we shall calmly turn our attention from the conclusions\nto be derived from such premises.\nYet, ladies and gentlemen, I have not invited you here to delude you or\nto conceal anything from you. I did, indeed, announce a _General\nIntroduction to Psychoanalysis_, but I did not intend the title to\nconvey that I was an oracle, who would show you a finished product with\nall the difficulties carefully concealed, all the gaps filled in and all\nthe doubts glossed over, so that you might peacefully believe you had\nlearned something new. No, precisely because you are beginners, I wanted\nto show you our science as it is, with all its hills and pitfalls,\ndemands and considerations. For I know that it is the same in all\nsciences, and must be so in their beginnings particularly. I know, too,\nthat teaching as a rule endeavors to hide these difficulties and these\nincompletely developed phases from the student. But that will not do in\npsychoanalysis. I have, as a matter of fact, made two assumptions, one\nwithin the other, and he who finds the whole too troublesome and too\nuncertain or is accustomed to greater security or more elegant\nderivations, need go no further with us. What I mean is, he should leave\npsychological problems entirely alone, for it must be apprehended that\nhe will not find the sure and safe way he is prepared to go,\ntraversable. Then, too, it is superfluous for a science that has\nsomething to offer to plead for auditors and adherents. Its results must\ncreate its atmosphere, and it must then bide its time until these have\nattracted attention to themselves.\nI would warn those of you, however, who care to continue, that my two\nassumptions are not of equal worth. The first, that the dream is a\npsychic phenomenon, is the assumption we wish to prove by the results of\nour work. The other has already been proved in another field, and I take\nthe liberty only of transferring it from that field to our problem.\nWhere, in what field of observation shall we seek the proof that there\nis in man a knowledge of which he is not conscious, as we here wish to\nassume in the case of the dreamer? That would be a remarkable, a\nsurprising fact, one which would change our understanding of the psychic\nlife, and which would have no need to hide itself. To name it would be\nto destroy it, and yet it pretends to be something real, a contradiction\nin terms. Nor does it hide itself. It is no result of the fact itself\nthat we are ignorant of its existence and have not troubled sufficiently\nabout it. That is just as little our fault as the fact that all these\npsychological problems are condemned by persons who have kept away from\nall observations and experiments which are decisive in this respect.\nThe proof appeared in the field of hypnotic phenomena. When, in the year\n1889, I was a witness to the extraordinarily enlightening demonstrations\nof Siebault and Bernheim in Nancy, I witnessed also the following\nexperiment: If one placed a man in the somnambulistic state, allowed him\nto have all manner of hallucinatory experience, and then woke him up, it\nappeared in the first instance that he knew nothing about what had\nhappened during his hypnotic sleep. Bernheim then directly invited him\nto relate what had happened to him during the hypnosis. He maintained he\nwas unable to recall anything. But Bernheim insisted, he persisted, he\nassured him he did know, that he must recall, and, incredible though it\nmay seem, the man wavered, began to rack his memory, recalled in a\nshadowy way first one of the suggested experiences, then another; the\nrecollection became more and more complete and finally was brought forth\nwithout a gap. The fact that he had this knowledge finally, and that he\nhad had no experiences from any other source in the meantime, permits\nthe conclusion that he knew of these recollections in the beginning.\nThey were merely inaccessible, he did not know that he knew them; he\nbelieved he did not know them. This is exactly what we suspect in the\ndreamer.\nI trust you are taken by surprise by the establishment of this fact, and\nthat you will ask me why I did not refer to this proof before in the\ncase of the slips, where we credited the man who made a mistake in\nspeech with intentions he knew nothing about and which he denied. \"If a\nperson believes he knows nothing concerning experiences, the memory of\nwhich, however, he retains,\" you might say, \"it is no longer so\nimprobable that there are also other psychic experiences within him of\nwhose existence he is ignorant. This argument would have impressed us\nand advanced us in the understanding of errors.\" To be sure, I might\nthen have referred to this but I reserved it for another place, where it\nwas more necessary. Errors have in a measure explained themselves, have,\nin part, furnished us with the warning that we must assume the existence\nof psychic processes of which we know nothing, for the sake of the\nconnection of the phenomena. In dreams we are compelled to look to other\nsources for explanations; and besides, I count on the fact that you will\npermit the inference I draw from hypnotism more readily in this\ninstance. The condition in which we make mistakes most seem to you to\nbe the normal one. It has no similarity to the hypnotic. On the other\nhand, there is a clear relationship between the hypnotic state and\nsleep, which is the essential condition of dreams. Hypnotism is known as\nartificial sleep; we say to the person whom we hypnotize, \"Sleep,\" and\nthe suggestions which we throw out are comparable to the dreams of\nnatural sleep. The psychical conditions are in both cases really\nanalogous. In natural sleep we withdraw our attention from the entire\noutside world; in the hypnotic, on the other hand, from the whole world\nwith the exception of the one person who has hypnotized us, with whom we\nremain in touch. Furthermore, the so-called nurse's sleep in which the\nnurse remains in touch with the child, and can be waked only by him, is\na normal counterpart of hypnotism. The transference of one of the\nconditions of hypnotism to natural sleep does not appear to be such a\ndaring proceeding. The inferential assumption that there is also present\nin the case of the dreamer a knowledge of his dream, a knowledge which\nis so inaccessible that he does not believe it himself, does not seem to\nbe made out of whole cloth. Let us note that at this point there appears\na third approach to the study of the dream; from the sleep-disturbing\nstimuli, from the day-dreams, and now in addition, from the suggested\ndreams of the hypnotic state.\nNow we return, perhaps with increased faith, to our problem. Apparently\nit is very probable that the dreamer knows of his dream; the question\nis, how to make it possible for him to discover this knowledge, and to\nimpart it to us? We do not demand that he give us the meaning of his\ndream at once, but he will be able to discover its origin, the thought\nand sphere of interest from which it springs. In the case of the errors,\nyou will remember, the man was asked how he happened to use the wrong\nword, \"_vorschwein_,\" and his next idea gave us the explanation. Our\ndream technique is very simple, an imitation of this example. We again\nask how the subject happened to have the dream, and his next statement\nis again to be taken as an explanation. We disregard the distinction\nwhether the dreamer believes or does not believe he knows, and treat\nboth cases in the same way.\nThis technique is very simple indeed, but I am afraid it will arouse\nyour sharpest opposition. You will say, \"a new assumption. The third!\nAnd the most improbable of all! If I ask the dreamer what he considers\nthe explanation of his dream to be, his very next association is to be\nthe desired explanation? But it may be he thinks of nothing at all, or\nhis next thought may be anything at all. We cannot understand upon what\nwe can base such anticipation. This, really, is putting too much faith\nin a situation where a slightly more critical attitude would be more\nsuitable. Furthermore, a dream is not an isolated error, but consists of\nmany elements. To which idea should we pin our faith?\"\nYou are right in all the non-essentials. A dream must indeed be\ndistinguished from a word slip, even in the number of its elements. The\ntechnique is compelled to consider this very carefully. Let me suggest\nthat we separate the dream into its elements, and carry on the\ninvestigation of each element separately; then the analogy to the\nword-slip is again set up. You are also correct when you say that in\nanswer to the separate dream elements no association may occur to the\ndreamer. There are cases in which we accept this answer, and later you\nwill hear what those cases are. They are, oddly enough, cases in which\nwe ourselves may have certain associations. But in general we shall\ncontradict the dreamer when he maintains he has no associations. We\nshall insist that he must have some association and--we shall be\njustified. He will bring forth some association, any one, it makes no\ndifference to us. He will be especially facile with certain information\nwhich might be designated as historical. He will say, \"that is something\nthat happened yesterday\" (as in the two \"prosaic\" dreams with which we\nare acquainted); or, \"that reminds me of something that happened\nrecently,\" and in this manner we shall notice that the act of\nassociating the dreams with recent impressions is much more frequent\nthan we had at first supposed. Finally, the dreamer will remember\noccurrences more remote from the dream, and ultimately even events in\nthe far past.\nBut in the essential matters you are mistaken. If you believe that we\nassume arbitrarily that the dreamer's next association will disclose\njust what we are seeking, or must lead to it, that on the contrary the\nassociation is just as likely to be entirely inconsequential, and\nwithout any connection with what we are seeking, and that it is an\nexample of my unbounded optimism to expect anything else, then you are\ngreatly mistaken. I have already taken the liberty of pointing out that\nin each one of you there is a deep-rooted belief in psychic freedom and\nvolition, a belief which is absolutely unscientific, and which must\ncapitulate before the claims of a determinism that controls even the\npsychic life. I beg of you to accept it as a fact that only this one\nassociation will occur to the person questioned. But I do not put one\nbelief in opposition to another. It can be proved that the association,\nwhich the subject produces, is not voluntary, is not indeterminable, not\nunconnected with what we seek. Indeed, I discovered long ago--without,\nhowever, laying too much stress on the discovery--that even experimental\npsychology has brought forth this evidence.\nI ask you to give your particular attention to the significance of this\nsubject. If I invite a person to tell me what occurs to him in relation\nto some certain element of his dream I am asking him to abandon himself\nto free association, _controlled by a given premise_. This demands a\nspecial delimitation of the attention, quite different from cogitation,\nin fact, exclusive of cogitation. Many persons put themselves into such\na state easily; others show an extraordinarily high degree of\nclumsiness. There is a higher level of free association again, where I\nomit this original premise and designate only the manner of the\nassociation, e.g., rule that the subject freely give a proper name or a\nnumber. Such an association would be more voluntary, more\nindeterminable, than the one called forth by our technique. But it can\nbe shown that it is strongly determined each time by an important inner\nmental set which, at the moment at which it is active, is unknown to us,\njust as unknown as the disturbing tendencies in the case of errors and\nthe provocative tendencies in the case of accidental occurrences.\nI, and many others after me, have again and again instigated such\ninvestigations for names and numbers which occur to the subject without\nany restraint, and have published some results. The method is the\nfollowing: Proceeding from the disclosed names, we awaken continuous\nassociations which then are no longer entirely free, but rather are\nlimited as are the associations to the dream elements, and this is true\nuntil the impulse is exhausted. By that time, however, the motivation\nand significance of the free name associations is explained. The\ninvestigations always yield the same results, the information often\ncovers a wealth of material and necessitates lengthy elaboration. The\nassociations to freely appearing numbers are perhaps the most\nsignificant. They follow one another so quickly and approach a hidden\ngoal with such inconceivable certainty, that it is really startling. I\nwant to give you an example of such a name analysis, one that, happily,\ninvolves very little material.\nIn the course of my treatment of a young man, I referred to this subject\nand mentioned the fact that despite the apparent volition it is\nimpossible to have a name occur which does not appear to be limited by\nthe immediate conditions, the peculiarities of the subject, and the\nmomentary situation. He was doubtful, and I proposed that he make such\nan attempt immediately. I know he has especially numerous relations of\nevery sort with women and girls, and so am of the opinion that he will\nhave an unusually wide choice if he happens to think of a woman's name.\nHe agrees. To my astonishment, and perhaps even more to his, no\navalanche of women's names descends upon my head, but he is silent for a\ntime, and then admits that a single name has occurred to him--and no\nother: _Albino_. How extraordinary, but what associations have you with\nthis name? How many albinoes do you know? Strangely enough, he knew no\nalbinoes, and there were no further associations with the name. One\nmight conclude the analysis had proved a failure; but no--it was already\ncomplete; no further association was necessary. The man himself had\nunusually light coloring. In our talks during the cure I had frequently\ncalled him an albino in fun. We were at the time occupied in determining\nthe feminine characteristics of his nature. He himself was the Albino,\nwho at that moment was to him the most interesting feminine person.\nIn like manner, melodies, which come for no reason, show themselves\nconditioned by and associated with a train of thought which has a right\nto occupy one, yet of whose activity one is unconscious. It is easily\ndemonstrable that the attraction to the melody is associated with the\ntext, or its origin. But I must take the precaution not to include in\nthis assertion really musical people, with whom, as it happens, I have\nhad no experience. In their cases the musical meaning of the melody may\nhave occasioned its occurrence. More often the first reason holds. I\nknow of a young man who for a time was actually haunted by the really\ncharming melody of the song of Paris, from _The Beautiful Helen_, until\nthe analysis brought to his attention the fact that at that time his\ninterest was divided between an Ida and a Helen.\nIf then the entirely unrestrained associations are conditioned in such a\nmanner and are arranged in a distinct order, we are justified in\nconcluding that associations with a single condition, that of an\noriginal premise, or starting point, may be conditioned to no less\ndegree. The investigation does in fact show that aside from the\nconditioning which we have established by the premise, a second farther\ndependence is recognizable upon powerful affective thoughts, upon cycles\nof interest and complexes of whose influence we are ignorant, therefore\nunconscious at the time.\nAssociations of this character have been the subject matter of very\nenlightening experimental investigations, which have played a noteworthy\nrole in the history of psychoanalysis. The Wundt school proposed the\nso-called association-experiment, wherein the subject is given the task\nof answering in the quickest possible time, with any desired reaction,\nto a given stimulus-word. It is then possible to study the interval of\ntime that elapses between the stimulus and the reaction, the nature of\nthe answer given as reaction, the possible mistake in a subsequent\nrepetition of the same attempt, and similar matters. The Zurich School\nunder the leadership of Bleuler and Jung, gave the explanation of the\nreactions following the association-experiment, by asking the subject to\nexplain a given reaction by means of further associations, in the cases\nwhere there was anything extraordinary in the reaction. It then became\napparent that these extraordinary reactions were most sharply determined\nby the complexes of the subject. In this matter Bleuler and Jung built\nthe first bridge from experimental psychology to psychoanalysis.\nThus instructed, you will be able to say, \"We recognize now that free\nassociations are predetermined, not voluntary, as we had believed. We\nadmit this also as regards the associations connected with the elements\nof the dream, but that is not what we are concerned with. You maintain\nthat the associations to the dream element are determined by the unknown\npsychic background of this very element. We do not think that this is a\nproven fact. We expect, to be sure, that the association to the dream\nelement will clearly show itself through one of the complexes of the\ndreamer, but what good is that to us? That does not lead us to\nunderstand the dream, but rather, as in the case of the\nassociation-experiment, to a knowledge of the so-called complexes. What\nhave these to do with the dream?\"\nYou are right, but you overlook one point, in fact, the very point\nbecause of which I did not choose the association-experiment as the\nstarting point for this exposition. In this experiment the one\ndeterminate of the reaction, viz., the stimulus word, is voluntarily\nchosen. The reaction is then an intermediary between this stimulus word\nand the recently aroused complex of the subject. In the dream the\nstimulus word is replaced by something that itself has its origin in the\npsychic life of the dreamer, in sources unknown to him, hence very\nlikely itself a product of the complex. It is not an altogether\nfantastic hypothesis, then, that the more remote associations, even\nthose that are connected with the dream element, are determined by no\nother complex than the one which determines the dream element itself,\nand will lead to the disclosure of the complex.\nLet me show you by another case that the situation is really as we\nexpect it to be. Forgetting proper names is really a splendid example\nfor the case of dream analysis; only here there is present in one person\nwhat in the dream interpretation is divided between two persons. Though\nI have forgotten a name temporarily I still retain the certainty that I\nknow the name; that certainty which we could acquire for the dreamer\nonly by way of the Bernheim experiment. The forgotten name, however, is\nnot accessible. Cogitation, no matter how strenuous, does not help.\nExperience soon tells me that. But I am able each time to find one or\nmore substitute names for the forgotten name. If such a substitute name\noccurs to me spontaneously then the correspondence between this\nsituation and that of the dream analysis first becomes evident. Nor is\nthe dream element the real thing, but only a substitute for something\nelse, for what particular thing I do not know, but am to discover by\nmeans of the dream analysis. The difference lies only in this, that in\nforgetting a name I recognize the substitute automatically as\nunsuitable, while in the dream element we must acquire this\ninterpretation with great labor. When a name is forgotten, too, there\nis a way to go from the substitute to the unknown reality, to arrive at\nthe forgotten name. If I centre my attention on the substitute name and\nallow further associations to accumulate, I arrive in a more or less\nroundabout way at the forgotten name, and discover that the spontaneous\nsubstitute names, together with those called up by me, have a certain\nconnection with the forgotten name, were conditioned by it.\nI want to show you an analysis of this type. One day I noticed that I\ncould not recall the name of the little country in the Riviera of which\nMonte Carlo is the capital. It is very annoying, but it is true. I steep\nmyself in all my knowledge about this country, think of Prince Albert,\nof the house of Lusignan, of his marriages, his preference for deep-sea\nstudy, and anything else I can think of, but to no avail. So I give up\nthe thinking, and in place of the lost name allow substitute names to\nsuggest themselves. They come quickly--Monte Carlo itself, then\nPiedmont, Albania, Montevideo, Colico. Albania is the first to attract\nmy attention, it is replaced by Montenegro, probably because of the\ncontrast between black and white. Then I see that four of these\nsubstitutes contain the same syllable _mon_. I suddenly have the\nforgotten word, and cry aloud, \"_Monaco_.\" The substitutes really\noriginated in the forgotten word, the four first from the first\nsyllable, the last brings back the sequence of syllables and the entire\nfinal syllable. In addition, I am also able easily to discover what it\nwas that took the name from my memory for a time. Monaco is also the\nItalian name of Munich; this latter town exerted the inhibiting\ninfluence.\nThe example is pretty enough, but too simple. In other cases we must add\nto the first substitute names a long line of associations, and then the\nanalogy to the dream interpretation becomes clearer. I have also had\nsuch experiences. Once when a stranger invited me to drink Italian wine\nwith him, it so happened in the hostelry that he forgot the name of the\nwine he had intended to order just because he had retained a most\npleasant memory of it. Out of a profusion of dissimilar substitute\nassociations which came to him in the place of the forgotten name, I was\nable to conclude that the memory of some one named Hedwig had deprived\nhim of the name of the wine, and he actually confirmed not only that he\nhad first tasted this wine in the company of a Hedwig, but he also, as\na result of this declaration, recollected the name again. He was at the\ntime happily married, and this Hedwig belonged to former times, not now\nrecalled with pleasure.\nWhat is possible in forgetting names must work also in dream\ninterpretation, viz., making the withheld actuality accessible by means\nof substitutions and through connecting associations. As exemplified by\nname-forgetting, we may conclude that in the case of the associations to\nthe dream element they will be determined as well by the dream element\nas by its unknown essential. Accordingly, we have advanced a few steps\nin the formulation of our dream technique.\nSEVENTH LECTURE\nTHE DREAM\n_Manifest Dream Content and Latent Dream Thought_\nWe have not studied the problem of errors in vain. Thanks to our efforts\nin this field, under the conditions known to you, we have evolved two\ndifferent things, a conception of the elements of the dream and a\ntechnique for dream interpretation. The conception of the dream element\ngoes to show something unreal, a substitute for something else, unknown\nto the dreamer, similar to the tendency of errors, a substitute for\nsomething the dreamer knows but cannot approach. We hope to transfer the\nsame conception to the whole dream, which consists of just such\nelements. Our method consists of calling up, by means of free\nassociations, other substitute formations in addition to these elements,\nfrom which we divine what is hidden.\nLet me ask you to permit a slight change in our nomenclature which will\ngreatly increase the flexibility of our vocabulary. Instead of hidden,\nunapproachable, unreal, let us give a truer description and say\ninaccessible or unknown to the consciousness of the dreamer. By this we\nmean only what the connection with the lost word or with the interfering\nintention of the error can suggest to you, namely, unconscious _for the\ntime being_. Naturally in contrast to this we may term _conscious_ the\nelements of the dream itself and the substitute formations just gained\nby association. As yet there is absolutely no theoretical construction\nimplied in this nomenclature. The use of the word unconscious as a\nsuitable and intelligible descriptive epithet is above criticism.\nIf we transfer our conception from a single element to the entire dream,\nwe find that the dream as a whole is a distorted substitute for\nsomething else, something unconscious. To discover this unconscious\nthing is the task of dream interpretation. From this, three important\nrules, which we must observe in the work of dream interpretation, are\nstraightway derived:\n1. What the dream seems to say, whether it be sensible or absurd, clear\nor confused is not our concern, since it can under no condition be that\nunconscious content we are seeking. Later we shall have to observe an\nobvious limitation of this rule. 2. The awakening of substitute\nformations for each element shall be the sole object of our work. We\nshall not reflect on these, test their suitability or trouble how far\nthey lead away from the element of the dream. 3. We shall wait until the\nhidden unconscious we are seeking appears of itself, as the missing word\n_Monaco_ in the experiment which we have described.\nNow we can understand, too, how unimportant it is how much, how little,\nabove all, how accurately or how indifferently the dream is remembered.\nFor the dream which is remembered is not the real one, but a distorted\nsubstitute, which is to help us approach the real dream by awakening\nother substitute formations and by making the unconscious in the dream\nconscious. Therefore if our recollection of the dream was faulty, it has\nsimply brought about a further distortion of this substitute, a\ndistortion which cannot, however, be unmotivated.\nOne can interpret one's own dreams as well as those of others. One\nlearns even more from these, for the process yields more proof. If we\ntry this, we observe that something impedes the work. Haphazard ideas\narise, but we do not let them have their way. Tendencies to test and to\nchoose make themselves felt. As an idea occurs, we say to ourselves \"No,\nthat does not fit, that does not belong here\"; of a second \"that is too\nsenseless\"; of a third, \"this is entirely beside the point\"; and one can\neasily observe how the ideas are stifled and suppressed by these\nobjections, even before they have become entirely clear. On the one\nhand, therefore, too much importance is attached to the dream elements\nthemselves; on the other, the result of free association is vitiated by\nthe process of selection. If you are not interpreting the dream alone,\nif you allow someone else to interpret it for you, you will soon\ndiscover another motive which induces you to make this forbidden choice.\nAt times you say to yourself, \"No, this idea is too unpleasant, I either\nwill not or cannot divulge this.\"\nClearly these objections are a menace to the success of our work. We\nmust guard against them, in our own case by the firm resolve not to give\nway to them; and in the interpretation of the dreams of others by making\nthe hard and fast rule for them, never to omit any idea from their\naccount, even if one of the following four objections should arise: that\nis, if it should seem too unimportant, absurd, too irrelevant or too\nembarrassing to relate. The dreamer promises to obey this rule, but it\nis annoying to see how poorly he keeps his promise at times. At first we\naccount for this by supposing that in spite of the authoritative\nassurance which has been given to the dreamer, he is not impressed with\nthe importance of free association, and plan perhaps to win his\ntheoretic approval by giving him papers to read or by sending him to\nlectures which are to make him a disciple of our views concerning free\nassociation. But we are deterred from such blunders by the observation\nthat, in one's own case, where convictions may certainly be trusted, the\nsame critical objections arise against certain ideas, and can only be\nsuppressed subsequently, upon second thought, as it were.\nInstead of becoming vexed at the disobedience of the dreamer, these\nexperiences can be turned to account in teaching something new,\nsomething which is the more important the less we are prepared for it.\nWe understand that the task of interpreting dreams is carried on against\na certain _resistance_ which manifests itself by these critical\nobjections. This resistance is independent of the theoretical conviction\nof the dreamer. Even more is apparent. We discover that such a critical\nobjection is never justified. On the contrary, those ideas which we are\nso anxious to suppress, prove _without exception_ to be the most\nimportant, the most decisive, in the search for the unconscious. It is\neven a mark of distinction if an idea is accompanied by such an\nobjection.\nThis resistance is something entirely new, a phenomenon which we have\nfound as a result of our hypotheses although it was not originally\nincluded in them. We are not too pleasantly surprised by this new factor\nin our problem. We suspect that it will not make our work any easier. It\nmight even tempt us to abandon our entire work in connection with the\ndream. Such an unimportant thing as the dream and in addition such\ndifficulties instead of a smooth technique! But from another point of\nview, these same difficulties may prove fascinating, and suggest that\nthe work is worth the trouble. Whenever we try to penetrate to the\nhidden unconscious, starting out from the substitute which the dream\nelement represents, we meet with resistance. Hence, we are justified in\nsupposing that something of weight must be hidden behind the substitute.\nWhat other reason could there be for the difficulties which are\nmaintained for purposes of concealment? If a child does not want to open\nhis clenched fist, he is certainly hiding something he ought not to\nhave.\nJust as soon as we bring the dynamic representation of resistance into\nour consideration of the case, we must realize that this factor is\nsomething quantitatively variable. There may be greater or lesser\nresistances and we are prepared to see these differences in the course\nof our work. We may perhaps connect this with another experience found\nin the work of dream interpretation. For sometimes only one or two ideas\nserve to carry us from the dream element to its unconscious aspect,\nwhile at other times long chains of associations and the suppression of\nmany critical objections are necessary. We shall note that these\nvariations are connected with the variable force of resistance. This\nobservation is probably correct. If resistance is slight, then the\nsubstitute is not far removed from the unconscious, but strong\nresistance carries with it a great distortion of the unconscious and in\naddition a long journey back to it.\nPerhaps the time has come to take a dream and try out our method to see\nif our faith in it shall be confirmed. But which dream shall we choose?\nYou cannot imagine how hard it is for me to decide, and at this point I\ncannot explain the source of the difficulty. Of course, there must be\ndreams which, as a whole, have suffered slight distortion, and it would\nbe best to start with one of these. But which dreams are the least\ndistorted? Those which are sensible and not confused, of which I have\nalready given you two examples? This would be a gross misunderstanding.\nTesting shows that these dreams have suffered by distortion to an\nexceptionally high degree. But if I take the first best dream,\nregardless of certain necessary conditions, you would probably be very\nmuch disappointed. Perhaps we should have to note such an abundance of\nideas in connection with single elements of dream that it would be\nabsolutely impossible to review the work in perspective. If we write the\ndream out and confront it with the written account of all the ideas\nwhich arise in connection with it, these may easily amount to a\nreiteration of the text of the dream. It would therefore seem most\npractical to choose for analysis several short dreams of which each one\ncan at least reveal or confirm something. This is what we shall decide\nupon, provided experience should not point out where we shall really\nfind slightly distorted dreams.\nBut I know of another way to simplify matters, one which, moreover, lies\nin our path. Instead of attempting the interpretation of entire dreams,\nwe shall limit ourselves to single dream elements and by observing a\nseries of examples we shall see how these are explained by the\napplication of our method.\n1. A lady relates that as a child she often dreamt \"_that God had a\npointed paper hat on his head_.\" How do you expect to understand that\nwithout the help of the dreamer? Why, it sounds quite absurd. It is no\nlonger absurd when the lady testifies that as a child she was frequently\nmade to wear such a hat at the table, because she could not help\nstealing glances at the plates of her brothers and sisters to see if one\nof them had gotten more than she. The hat was therefore supposed to act\nas a sort of blinder. This explanation was moreover historic, and given\nwithout the least difficulty. The meaning of this fragment and of the\nwhole brief dream, is clear with the help of a further idea of the\ndreamer. \"Since I had heard that God was all-knowing and all-seeing,\"\nshe said, \"the dream can only mean that I know everything and see\neverything just as God does, even when they try to prevent me.\" This\nexample is perhaps too simple.\n2. A sceptical patient has a longer dream, in which certain people\nhappen to tell her about my book concerning laughter and praise it\nhighly. Then something is mentioned about a certain \"_'canal,' perhaps\nanother book in which 'canal' occurs, or something else with the word\n'canal' ... she doesn't know ... it is all confused_.\"\nNow you will be inclined to think that the element \"canal\" will evade\ninterpretation because it is so vague. You are right as to the supposed\ndifficulty, but it is not difficult because it is vague, but rather it\nis vague for a different reason, the same reason which also makes the\ninterpretation difficult. The dreamer can think of nothing concerning\nthe word canal, I naturally can think of nothing. A little while later,\nas a matter of fact on the next day, she tells me that something\noccurred to her that _may perhaps_ be related to it, a joke that she has\nheard. On a ship between Dover and Calais a well-known author is\nconversing with an Englishman, who quoted the following proverb in a\ncertain connection: \"_Du sublime au ridicule, il n'y a qu'un pas_.\"[24]\nThe author answers, \"_Oui, le pas de Calais_,\"[25] with which he wishes\nto say that he finds France sublime and England ridiculous. But the\n\"_Pas de Calais_\" is really a canal, namely, the English Channel. Do I\nthink that this idea has anything to do with the dream? Certainly, I\nbelieve that it really gives the solution to the puzzling dream\nfragments. Or can you doubt that this joke was already present in the\ndream, as the unconscious factor of the element, \"canal.\" Can you take\nit for granted that it was subsequently added to it? The idea testifies\nto the scepticism which is concealed behind her obtrusive admiration,\nand the resistance is probably the common reason for both phenomena, for\nthe fact that the idea came so hesitatingly and that the decisive\nelement of the dream turned out to be so vague. Kindly observe at this\npoint the relation of the dream element to its unconscious factor. It is\nlike a small part of the unconscious, like an allusion to it; through\nits isolation it became quite unintelligible.\n3. A patient dreams, in the course of a longer dream: \"_Around a table\nof peculiar shape several members of his family are sitting, etc._\" In\nconnection with this table, it occurs to him that he saw such a piece of\nfurniture during a visit to a certain family. Then his thoughts\ncontinue: In this family a peculiar relation had existed between father\nand son, and soon he adds to this that as a matter of fact the same\nrelation exists between himself and his father. The table is therefore\ntaken up into the dream to designate this parallel.\nThis dreamer had for a long time been familiar with the claims of dream\ninterpretation. Otherwise he might have taken exception to the fact that\nso trivial a detail as the shape of a table should be taken as the\nbasis of the investigation. As a matter of fact we judge nothing in the\ndream as accidental or indifferent, and we expect to reach our\nconclusion by the explanation of just such trivial and unmotivated\ndetails. Perhaps you will be surprised that the dream work should arouse\nthe thought \"we are in exactly the same position as they are,\" just by\nthe choice of the table. But even this becomes clear when you learn that\nthe name of the family in question is _Tischler_. By permitting his own\nfamily to sit at such a table, he intends to express that they too are\n_Tischler_. Please note how, in relating such a dream interpretation,\none must of necessity become indiscreet. Here you have arrived at one of\nthe difficulties in the choice of examples that I indicated before. I\ncould easily have substituted another example for this one, but would\nprobably have avoided this indiscretion at the cost of committing\nanother one in its place.\nThe time has come to introduce two new terms, which we could have used\nlong ago. We shall call that which the dream relates, the manifest\ncontent of the dream; that which is hidden, which we can only reach by\nthe analysis of ideas we shall call latent dream thoughts. We may now\nconsider the connection between the manifest dream content and the\nlatent dream thoughts as they are revealed in these examples. Many\ndifferent connections can exist. In examples 1 and 2 the manifest\ncontent is also a constituent part of the latent thought, but only a\nvery small part of it. A small piece of a great composite psychic\nstructure in the unconscious dream thought has penetrated into the\nmanifest dream, like a fragment of it, or in other cases, like an\nallusion to it, like a catchword or an abbreviation in the telegraphic\ncode. The interpretation must mould this fragment, or indication, into a\nwhole, as was done most successfully in example 2. One sort of\ndistortion of which the dream mechanism consists is therefore\nsubstitution by means of a fragment or an allusion. In the third,\nmoreover, we must recognize another relation which we shall see more\nclearly and distinctly expressed in the following examples:\n4. The dreamer \"_pulls a certain woman of his acquaintance from behind a\nbed_.\" He finds the meaning of this dream element himself by his first\nassociation. It means: This woman \"has a pull\" with him.[26]\n5. Another man dreams that \"_his brother is in a closet_.\" The first\nassociation substitutes _clothes-press_ for closet, and the second gives\nthe meaning: his brother is _close-pressed_ for money.[27]\n6. The dreamer \"_climbs a mountain from the top of which he has an\nextraordinarily distant view_.\" This sounds quite sensible; perhaps\nthere is nothing about it that needs interpretation, and it is simply\nnecessary to find out which reminiscence this dream touches upon and why\nit was recalled. But you are mistaken; it is evident that this dream\nrequires interpretation as well as any other which is confused. For no\nprevious mountain climbing of his own occurs to the dreamer, but he\nremembers that an acquaintance of his is publishing a \"_Rundschau_,\"\nwhich deals with our relation to the furthermost parts of the earth. The\nlatent dream thought is therefore in this case an identification of the\ndreamer with the \"_Rundschauer_.\"\nHere you find a new type of connection between the manifest content and\nthe latent dream element. The former is not so much a distortion of the\nlatter as a representation of it, a plastic concrete perversion that is\nbased on the sound of the word. However, it is for this very reason\nagain a distortion, for we have long ago forgotten from which concrete\npicture the word has arisen, and therefore do not recognize it by the\nimage which is substituted for it. If you consider that the manifest\ndream consists most often of visual images, and less frequently of\nthoughts and words, you can imagine that a very particular significance\nin dream formation is attached to this sort of relation. You can also\nsee that in this manner it becomes possible to create substitute\nformations for a great number of abstract thoughts in the manifest\ndream, substitutions that serve the purpose of further concealment all\nthe same. This is the technique of our picture puzzle. What the origin\nis of the semblance of wit which accompanies such representations is a\nparticular question which we need not touch upon at this time.\nA fourth type of relation between the manifest and the latent dream\ncannot be dealt with until its cue in the technique has been given. Even\nthen I shall not have given you a complete enumeration, but it will be\nsufficient for our purpose.\nHave you the courage to venture upon the interpretation of an entire\ndream? Let us see if we are well enough equipped for this undertaking.\nOf course, I shall not choose one of the most obscure, but one\nnevertheless that shows in clear outline the general characteristics of\na dream.\nA young woman who has been married for many years dreams: \"_She is\nsitting in the theatre with her husband; one side of the orchestra is\nentirely unoccupied. Her husband tells her that Elise L. and her\nbridegroom had also wished to come, but had only been able to procure\npoor seats, three for_ 1 _Fl.,_ 50 _Kr. and those of course they could\nnot take. She thinks this is no misfortune for them._\"\nThe first thing that the dreamer has to testify is that the occasion for\nthe dream is touched upon in its manifest content. Her husband had\nreally told her that Elise L., an acquaintance of about her age, had\nbecome engaged. The dream is the reaction to this news. We already know\nthat in the case of many dreams it is easy to trace such a cause to the\npreceding day, and that the dreamer often gives these deductions without\nany difficulty. The dreamer also places at our disposal further\ninformation for other parts of the manifest dream content. Whence the\ndetail that one side of the orchestra is unoccupied? It is an allusion\nto an actual occurrence of the previous week. She had made up her mind\nto go to a certain performance and had procured tickets in advance, so\nmuch in advance that she had been forced to pay a preference tax.[28]\nWhen she arrived at the theatre, she saw how needless had been her\nanxiety, for _one side of the orchestra was almost empty_. She could\nhave bought the tickets on the day of the performance itself. Her\nhusband would not stop teasing her about her excessive haste. Whence the\n1 Fl. 50 Kr.? From a very different connection that has nothing to do\nwith the former, but which also alludes to an occurrence of the previous\nday. Her sister-in-law had received 150 florins as a present from her\nhusband, and knew no better, the poor goose, than to hasten to the\njeweler and spend the money on a piece of jewelry. Whence the number 3?\nShe can think of nothing in connection with this unless one stresses the\nassociation that the bride, Elise L., is only three months younger than\nshe herself, who has been married for almost ten years. And the\nabsurdity of buying three tickets for two people? She says nothing of\nthis, and indeed denies all further associations or information.\nBut she has given us so much material in her few associations, that it\nbecomes possible to derive the latent dream thought from it. It must\nstrike us that in her remarks concerning the dream, time elements which\nconstitute a common element in the various parts of this material appear\nat several points. She attended to the tickets _too soon_, took them\n_too hastily_, so that she had to pay more than usual for them; her\nsister-in-law likewise _hastened_ to carry her money to the jeweler's to\nbuy a piece of jewelry, just as if she might _miss_ it. Let us add to\nthe expressions \"_too early_,\" \"_precipitately_,\" which are emphasized\nso strongly, the occasion for the dream, namely, that her friend only\nthree months younger than herself had even now gotten a good husband,\nand the criticism expressed in the condemnation of her sister-in-law,\nthat it was _foolish_ to hurry so. Then the following construction of\nthe latent dream thought, for which the manifest dream is a badly\ndistorted substitute, comes to us almost spontaneously:\n\"How _foolish_ it was of me to hurry so in marrying! Elise's example\nshows me that I could have gotten a husband later too.\" (The\nprecipitateness is represented by her own behavior in buying the\ntickets, and that of her sister-in-law in purchasing jewelry. Going to\nthe theatre was substituted for getting married. This appears to have\nbeen the main thought; and perhaps we may continue, though with less\ncertainty, because the analysis in these parts is not supported by\nstatements of the dreamer.) \"And I would have gotten 100 times as much\nfor my money.\" (150 Fl. is 100 times as much as 1 Fl. 50 Kr.). If we\nmight substitute the dowry for the money, then it would mean that one\nbuys a husband with a dowry; the jewelry as well as the poor seats would\nrepresent the husband. It would be even more desirable if the fragment\n\"3 seats\" had something to do with a husband. But our understanding does\nnot penetrate so far. We have only guessed that the dream expresses her\n_disparagement_ of her own husband, and her regret at having _married so\nearly_.\nIt is my opinion that we are more surprised and confused than satisfied\nby the result of this first dream interpretation. We are swamped by more\nimpressions than we can master. We see that the teachings of dream\ninterpretation are not easily exhausted. Let us hasten to select those\npoints that we recognize as giving us new, sound insight.\nIn the first place, it is remarkable that in the latent thought the main\nemphasis falls on the element of haste; in the manifest dream there is\nabsolutely no mention of this to be found. Without the analysis we\nshould not have had any idea that this element was of any importance at\nall. So it seems possible that just the main thing, the central point of\nthe unconscious thoughts, may be absent in the manifest dream. Because\nof this, the original impression in the dream must of necessity be\nentirely changed. Secondly: In the dream there is a senseless\ncombination, 3 for 1 Fl. 50 Kr.; in the dream thought we divine the\nsentence, \"It was senseless (to marry so early).\" Can one deny that this\nthought, \"It was senseless,\" was represented in the manifest dream by\nthe introduction of an absurd element? Thirdly: Comparison will show\nthat the relation between the manifest and latent elements is not\nsimple, certainly not of such a sort that a manifest element is always\nsubstituted for the latent. There must rather be a quantitative\nrelationship between the two groups, according to which a manifest\nelement may represent several latent ones, or a latent element\nrepresented by several manifest elements.\nMuch that is surprising might also be said of the sense of the dream and\nthe dreamer's reaction to it. She acknowledges the interpretation but\nwonders at it. She did not know that she disparaged her husband so, and\nshe did not know why she should disparage him to such a degree. There is\nstill much that is incomprehensible. I really believe that we are not\nyet fully equipped for dream interpretation, and that we must first\nreceive further instruction and preparation.\nEIGHTH LECTURE\nTHE DREAM\n_Dreams of Childhood_\nWe think we have advanced too rapidly. Let us go back a little. Before\nour last attempt to overcome the difficulties of dream distortion\nthrough our technique, we had decided that it would be best to avoid\nthem by limiting ourselves only to those dreams in which distortion is\neither entirely absent or of trifling importance, if there are such. But\nhere again we digress from the history of the evolution of our\nknowledge, for as a matter of fact we become aware of dreams entirely\nfree of distortion only after the consistent application of our method\nof interpretation and after complete analysis of the distorted dream.\nThe dreams we are looking for are found in children. They are short,\nclear, coherent, easy to understand, unambiguous, and yet unquestionable\ndreams. But do not think that all children's dreams are like this. Dream\ndistortion makes its appearance very early in childhood, and dreams of\nchildren from five to eight years of age have been recorded that showed\nall the characteristics of later dreams. But if you will limit\nyourselves to the age beginning with conscious psychic activity, up to\nthe fourth or fifth year, you will discover a series of dreams that are\nof a so-called infantile character. In a later period of childhood you\nwill be able to find some dreams of this nature occasionally. Even among\nadults, dreams that closely resemble the typically infantile ones occur\nunder certain conditions.\nFrom these children's dreams we gain information concerning the nature\nof dreams with great ease and certainty, and we hope it will prove\ndecisive and of universal application.\n1. For the understanding of these dreams we need no analysis, no\ntechnical methods. We need not question the child that is giving an\naccount of his dream. But one must add to this a story taken from the\nlife of the child. An experience of the previous day will always explain\nthe dream to us. The dream is a sleep-reaction of psychic life upon\nthese experiences of the day.\nWe shall now consider a few examples so that we may base our further\ndeductions upon them.\n_a_). A boy of 22 months is to present a basket of cherries as a\nbirthday gift. He plainly does so very unwillingly, although they\npromise him that he will get some of them himself. The next morning he\nrelates as his dream, \"_Hermann eat all cherries_.\"\n_b_). A little girl of three and a quarter years makes her first trip\nacross a lake. At the landing she does not want to leave the boat and\ncries bitterly. The time of the trip seems to her to have passed\nentirely too rapidly. The next morning she says, \"_Last night I rode on\nthe lake_.\" We may add the supplementary fact that this trip lasted\nlonger.\n_c_). A boy of five and a quarter years is taken on an excursion into\nthe Escherntal near Hallstatt. He had heard that Hallstatt lay at the\nfoot of the Dachstein, and had shown great interest in this mountain.\nFrom his home in Aussee there was a beautiful view of the Dachstein, and\nwith a telescope one could discern the Simonyhuette upon it. The child\nhad tried again and again to see it through the telescope, with what\nresult no one knew. He started on the excursion in a joyously expectant\nmood. Whenever a new mountain came in sight the boy asked, \"Is that the\nDachstein?\" The oftener this question was answered in the negative, the\nmore moody he became; later he became entirely silent and would not take\npart in a small climb to a waterfall. They thought he was overtired, but\nthe next morning, he said quite happily, \"_Last night I dreamed that we\nwere in the Simonyhuette_.\" It was with this expectation, therefore, that\nhe had taken part in the excursion. The only detail he gave was one he\nhad heard before, \"you had to climb steps for six hours.\"\nThese three dreams will suffice for all the information we desire.\n2. We see that children's dreams are not meaningless; they are\n_intelligible, significant, psychic acts_. You will recall what I\nrepresented to you as the medical opinion concerning the dream, the\nsimile of untrained fingers wandering aimlessly over the keys of the\npiano. You cannot fail to see how decidedly these dreams of childhood\nare opposed to this conception. But it would be strange indeed if the\nchild brought forth complete psychic products in sleep, while the adult\nin the same condition contents himself with spasmodic reactions. Indeed,\nwe have every reason to attribute the more normal and deeper sleep to\nthe child.\n3. Dream distortion is lacking in these dreams, therefore they need no\ninterpretation. The manifest and latent dreams are merged. _Dream\ndistortion is therefore not inherent in the dream._ I may assume that\nthis relieves you of a great burden. But upon closer consideration we\nshall have to admit of a tiny bit of distortion, a certain\ndifferentiation between manifest dream content and latent dream thought,\neven in these dreams.\n4. The child's dream is a reaction to an experience of the day, which\nhas left behind it a regret, a longing or an unfulfilled desire. _The\ndream brings about the direct unconcealed fulfillment of this wish._ Now\nrecall our discussions concerning the importance of the role of external\nor internal bodily stimuli as disturbers of sleep, or as dream\nproducers. We learned definite facts about this, but could only explain\na very small number of dreams in this way. In these children's dreams\nnothing points to the influence of such somatic stimuli; we cannot be\nmistaken, for the dreams are entirely intelligible and easy to survey.\nBut we need not give up the theory of physical causation entirely on\nthis account. We can only ask why at the outset we forgot that besides\nthe physical stimuli there are also psychic sleep-disturbing stimuli.\nFor we know that it is these stimuli that commonly cause the disturbed\nsleep of adults by preventing them from producing the ideal condition of\nsleep, the withdrawal of interest from the world. The dreamer does not\nwish to interrupt his life, but would rather continue his work with the\nthings that occupy him, and for this reason he does not sleep. The\nunfulfilled wish, to which he reacts by means of the dream, is the\npsychic sleep-disturbing stimulus for the child.\n5. From this point we easily arrive at an explanation of the function of\nthe dream. The dream, as a reaction to the psychic stimulus, must have\nthe value of a release of this stimulus which results in its elimination\nand in the continuation of sleep. We do not know how this release is\nmade possible by the dream, but we note that _the dream is not a\ndisturber of sleep_, as calumny says, _but a guardian of sleep, whose\nduty it is to quell disturbances_. It is true, we think we would have\nslept better if we had not dreamt, but here we are wrong; as a matter of\nfact, we would not have slept at all without the help of the dream. That\nwe have slept so soundly is due to the dream alone. It could not help\ndisturbing us slightly, just as the night watchman often cannot avoid\nmaking a little noise while he drives away the rioters who would awaken\nus with their noise.\n6. One main characteristic of the dream is that a wish is its source,\nand that the content of the dream is the gratification of this wish.\nAnother equally constant feature is that the dream does not merely\nexpress a thought, but also represents the fulfillment of this wish in\nthe form of a hallucinatory experience. \"_I should like to travel on the\nlake_,\" says the wish that excites the dream; the dream itself has as\nits content \"_I travel on the lake_.\" One distinction between the latent\nand manifest dream, a distortion of the latent dream thought, therefore\nremains even in the case of these simple children's dreams, namely, _the\ntranslation of the thought into experience_. In the interpretation of\nthe dream it is of utmost importance that this change be traced back. If\nthis should prove to be an extremely common characteristic of the dream,\nthen the above mentioned dream fragment, \"_I see my brother in a\ncloset_\" could not be translated, \"_My brother is close-pressed_,\" but\nrather, \"I wish that my brother were close-pressed, _my brother should\nbe close-pressed_.\" Of the two universal characteristics of the dream we\nhave cited, the second plainly has greater prospects of unconditional\nacknowledgment than the first. Only extensive investigation can\nascertain that the cause of the dream must always be a wish, and cannot\nalso be an anxiety, a plan or a reproach; but this does not alter the\nother characteristic, that the dream does not simply reproduce the\nstimulus but by experiencing it anew, as it were, removes, expells and\nsettles it.\n7. In connection with these characteristics of the dream we can again\nresume the comparison between the dream and the error. In the case of\nthe latter we distinguish an interfering tendency and one interfered\nwith, and the error is the compromise between the two. The dream fits\ninto the same scheme. The tendency interfered with, in this case, can\nbe no other than that of sleep. For the interfering tendency we\nsubstitute the psychic stimulus, the wish which strives for its\nfulfillment, let us say, for thus far we are not familiar with any other\nsleep-disturbing psychic stimulus. In this instance also the dream is\nthe result of compromise. We sleep, and yet we experience the removal of\na wish; we gratify the wish, but at the same time continue to sleep.\nBoth are partly carried out and partly given up.\n8. You will remember that we once hoped to gain access to the\nunderstanding of the dream problem by the fact that certain very\ntransparent phantasy formations are called _day dreams_. Now these day\ndreams are actual wish fulfillments, fulfillments of ambitious or erotic\nwishes with which we are familiar; but they are conscious, and though\nvividly imagined, they are never hallucinatory experiences. In this\ninstance, therefore, the less firmly established of the two main\ncharacteristics of the dream holds, while the other proves itself\nentirely dependent upon the condition of sleep and impossible to the\nwaking state. In colloquial usage, therefore, there is a presentment of\nthe fact that the fulfillment of a wish is a main characteristic of the\ndream. Furthermore, if the experience in the dream is a transformed\nrepresentation only made possible by the condition of sleep--in other\nwords, a sort of nocturnal day dream--then we can readily understand\nthat the occurrence of phantasy formations can release the nocturnal\nstimulus and bring satisfaction. For day dreaming is an activity closely\nbound up in gratification and is, indeed, pursued only for this reason.\nNot only this but other colloquial usages also express the same feeling.\nWell-known proverbs say, \"The pig dreams of acorns, the goose of maize,\"\nor ask, \"Of what does the hen dream? Of millet.\" So the proverb descends\neven lower than we do, from the child to the animal, and maintains that\nthe content of a dream is the satisfaction of a need. Many turns of\nspeech seem to point to the same thing--\"dreamlike beauty,\" \"I should\nnever have dreamed of that,\" \"in my wildest dreams I hadn't imagined\nthat.\" This is open partisanship on the part of colloquial usage. For\nthere are also dreams of fear and dreams of embarrassing or indifferent\ncontent, but they have not been drawn into common usage. It is true that\ncommon usage recognizes \"bad\" dreams, but still the dream plainly\nconnotates to it only the beautiful wish fulfillment. There is indeed\nno proverb that tells us that the pig or the goose dreams of being\nslaughtered.\nOf course it is unbelievable that the wish-fulfillment characteristic\nhas not been noted by writers on the dream. Indeed, this was very often\nthe case, but none of them thought of acknowledging this characteristic\nas universal and of making it the basis of an explanation of the dream.\nWe can easily imagine what may have deterred them and shall discuss it\nsubsequently.\nSee what an abundance of information we have gained, with almost no\neffort, from the consideration of children's dreams--the function of the\ndream as a guardian of sleep; its origin from two rival tendencies, of\nwhich the one, the longing for sleep, remains constant, while the other\ntries to satisfy a psychic stimulus; the proof that the dream is a\nsignificant psychic act; its two main characteristics: wish fulfillment\nand hallucinatory experience. And we were almost able to forget that we\nare engaged in psychoanalysis. Aside from its connection with errors our\nwork has no specific connotation. Any psychologist, who is entirely\nignorant of the claims of psychoanalysis, could have given this\nexplanation of children's dreams. Why has no one done so?\nIf there were only infantile dreams, our problem would be solved, our\ntask accomplished, and that without questioning the dreamer, or\napproaching the unconscious, and without taking free association into\nconsideration. The continuation of our task plainly lies in this\ndirection. We have already repeatedly had the experience that\ncharacteristics that at first seemed universally true, have subsequently\nheld good only for a certain kind and for a certain number of dreams. It\nis therefore for us to decide whether the common characteristics which\nwe have gathered from children's dreams can be applied universally,\nwhether they also hold for those dreams that are not transparent, whose\nmanifest content shows no connection with wishes left over from the\nprevious day. We think that these dreams have undergone considerable\ndistortion and for this reason are not to be judged superficially. We\nalso suspect that for the explanation of this distortion we shall need\nthe psychoanalytic method which we could dispense with in the\nunderstanding of children's dreams.\nThere is at any rate a class of dreams that are undistorted, and, just\nlike children's dreams, are easily recognizable as wish fulfillments. It\nis those that are called up throughout life by the imperative needs of\nthe body--hunger, thirst, sexual desire--hence wish fulfillments in\nreaction to internal physical stimuli. For this reason, I have noted the\ndream of a young girl, that consisted of a menu following her name (Anna\nF......, strawberry, huckleberry, egg-dish, pap), as a reaction to an\nenforced day of fasting on account of a spoiled stomach, which was\ndirectly traceable to the eating of the fruits twice mentioned in the\ndream. At the same time, the grandmother, whose age added to that of her\ngrandchild would make a full seventy, had to go without food for a day\non account of kidney-trouble, and dreamed the same night that she had\nbeen invited out and that the finest tid-bits had been set before her.\nObservations with prisoners who are allowed to go hungry, or with people\nwho suffer privations on travels or expeditions, show that under these\nconditions the dreams regularly deal with the satisfaction of these\nneeds. Otto Nordenskjold, in his book _Antarctic_ (1904), testifies to\nthe same thing concerning his crew, who were ice-bound with him during\nthe winter (Vol. 1, page 336). \"Very significant in determining the\ntrend of our inmost thoughts were our dreams, which were never more\nvivid and numerous than just at this time. Even those of our comrades\nwho ordinarily dreamed but seldom, now had long stories to tell, when in\nthe morning we exchanged our latest experiences in that realm of\nphantasy. All of them dealt with that outside world that now was so far\naway from us, but often they fitted into our present condition. Food and\ndrink were most often the pivots about which our dreams revolved. One of\nus, who excelled in going to great dinners in his sleep, was most happy\nwhenever he could tell us in the morning that he attended a dinner of\nthree courses; another one dreamed of tobacco, whole mountains of\ntobacco; still another dreamed of a ship that came along on the open\nsea, under full sail. One other dream deserves mention: The postman\ncomes with the mail and gives a long explanation of why it is so late;\nhe had delivered it to the wrong address and only after great trouble on\nhis part had succeeded in getting it back. Of course one occupies\nhimself with even more impossible things in sleep, but in nearly all the\ndreams that I myself dreamed or heard tell of, the lack of phantasy was\nquite striking. It would surely be of great psychological interest if\nall these dreams were recorded. It is easy to understand how we longed\nfor sleep, since it could offer us everything for which each one of us\nfelt the most burning desire.\" I quote further from Du Prel. \"Mungo\nPark, who during a trip in Africa was almost exhausted, dreamed without\ninterruption of the fertile valleys and fields of his home. Trenck,\ntortured by hunger in the redoubt at Magdeburg, likewise saw himself\nsurrounded by wonderful meals, and George Back, who took part in\nFranklin's first expedition, dreamed regularly and consistently of\nluxurious meals when, as a result of terrible privations, he was nearly\ndead of hunger.\"\nA man who feels great thirst at night after enjoying highly seasoned\nfood for supper, often dreams that he is drinking. It is of course\nimpossible to satisfy a rather strong desire for food or drink by means\nof the dream; from such a dream one awakes thirsty and must now drink\nreal water. The effect of the dream is in this case practically\ntrifling, but it is none the less clear that it was called up for the\npurpose of maintaining the sleep in spite of the urgent impulse to awake\nand to act. Dreams of satisfaction often overcome needs of a lesser\nintensity.\nIn a like manner, under the influence of sexual stimuli, the dream\nbrings about satisfaction that shows noteworthy peculiarities. As a\nresult of the characteristic of the sexual urge which makes it somewhat\nless dependent upon its object than hunger and thirst, satisfaction in a\ndream of pollution may be an actual one, and as a result of difficulties\nto be mentioned later in connection with the object, it happens\nespecially often that the actual satisfaction is connected with confused\nor distorted dream content. This peculiarity of the dream of pollution,\nas O. Rank has observed, makes it a fruitful subject to pursue in the\nstudy of dream distortion. Moreover, all dreams of desire of adults\nusually contain something besides satisfaction, something that has its\norigin in the sources of the purely psychic stimuli, and which requires\ninterpretation to render it intelligible.\nMoreover we shall not maintain that the wish-fulfillment dreams of the\ninfantile kind occur in adults only as reactions to the known imperative\ndesires. We also know of short clear dreams of this sort under the\ninfluence of dominating situations that arise from unquestionably\npsychic sources. As, for example, in dreams of impatience, whenever a\nperson has made preparations for a journey, for a theatrical\nperformance, for a lecture or for a visit, and now dreams of the\nanticipated fulfillment of his expectations, and so arrives at his goal\nthe night before the actual experience, in the theatre or in\nconversation with his host. Or the well-named dreams of comfort, when a\nperson who likes to prolong his sleep, dreams that he is already up, is\nwashing himself, or is already in school, while as a matter of fact he\ncontinues sleeping, hence would rather get up in a dream than in\nreality. The desire for sleep which we have recognized as a regular part\nof the dream structure becomes intense in these dreams and appears in\nthem as the actual shaping force of the dream. The wish for sleep\nproperly takes its place beside other great physical desires.\nAt this point I refer you to a picture by Schwind, from the Schack\nGallery in Munich, so that you may see how rightly the artist has\nconceived the origin of a dream from a dominating situation. It is the\n_Dream of a Prisoner_,[29] which can have no other subject than his\nrelease. It is a very neat stroke that the release should be effected\nthrough the window, for the ray of light that awakens the prisoner comes\nthrough the same window. The gnomes standing one above the other\nprobably represent the successive positions which he himself had to take\nin climbing to the height of the window, and I do not think I am\nmistaken or that I attribute too much preconcerted design to the artist,\nby noting that the uppermost of the gnomes, who is filing the grating\n(and so does what the prisoner would like to do) has the features of the\nprisoner.\nIn all other dreams except those of children and those of the infantile\ntype, distortion, as we have said, blocks our way. At the outset we\ncannot ascertain whether they are also wish fulfillments, as we suspect;\nfrom their manifest content we cannot determine from what psychic\nstimulus they derive their origin, and we cannot prove that they also\nare occupied in doing away with the stimulus and in satisfying it. They\nmust probably be interpreted, that is, translated; their distortion must\nbe annulled; their manifest content replaced by their latent thought\nbefore we can judge whether what we have found in children's dreams may\nclaim a universal application for all dreams.\nNINTH LECTURE\nTHE DREAM\n_The Dream Censor_\nWe have learned to know the origin, nature and function of the dream\nfrom the study of children's dreams. _Dreams are the removal of\nsleep-disturbing psychic stimuli by way of hallucinated satisfaction._\nOf adults' dreams, to be sure, we could explain only one group, what we\ncharacterized as dreams of an infantile type. As to the others we know\nnothing as yet, nor do we understand them. For the present, however, we\nhave obtained a result whose significance we do not wish to\nunder-estimate. Every time a dream is completely comprehensible to us,\nit proves to be an hallucinated wish-fulfillment. This coincidence\ncannot be accidental, nor is it an unimportant matter.\nWe conclude, on the basis of various considerations and by analogy to\nthe conception of mistakes, that another type of dream is a distorted\nsubstitute for an unknown content and that it must first be led back to\nthat content. Our next task is the investigation and the understanding\nof this dream distortion.\nDream distortion is the thing which makes the dream seem strange and\nincomprehensible to us. We want to know several things about it;\nfirstly, whence it comes, its dynamics; secondly, what it does; and\nfinally, how it does it. We can say at this point that dream distortion\nis the product of the dream work, that is, of the mental functioning of\nwhich the dream itself is the conscious symptom. Let us describe the\ndream work and trace it back to the forces which work upon it.\nAnd now I shall ask you to listen to the following dream. It was\nrecorded by a lady of our profession, and according to her, originated\nwith a highly cultivated and respected lady of advanced age. No analysis\nof this dream was made. Our informant remarks that to a psychoanalyst\nit needs no interpretation. The dreamer herself did not interpret it,\nbut she judged and condemned it as if she understood its interpretation.\nFor she said concerning it: \"That a woman of fifty should dream such\nabominable, stupid stuff--a woman who has no other thought, day and\nnight, than to care for her child!\"\nAnd now follows the dreams of the \"_services of love_.\" \"She goes into\nMilitary Hospital No. 1, and says to the sentry at the gate, that she\nmust speak to the chief physician ... (she mentions a name which is not\nfamiliar to her), as she wants to offer her service to the hospital. She\nstresses the word 'service,' so love services. Since she is an old lady\nhe lets her pass after some hesitation. But instead of reaching the\nchief physician, she finds herself in a large somber room in which there\nare many officers and army doctors sitting and standing around a long\ntable. She turns with her proposal to a staff doctor who, after a few\nwords, soon understands her. The words of her speech in the dream are,\n'I and numerous other women and girls of Vienna are ready for the\nsoldiers, troops, and officers, without distinction....' Here in the\ndream follows a murmuring. That the idea is, however, correctly\nunderstood by those present she sees from the semi-embarrassed, somewhat\nmalicious expressions of the officers. The lady then continues, 'I know\nthat our decision sounds strange, but we are in bitter earnest. The\nsoldier in the field is not asked either whether or not he wants to\ndie.' A moment of painful silence follows. The staff doctor puts his arm\naround her waist and says, 'Madame, let us assume that it really came to\nthat ...' (murmurs). She withdraws from his arm with the thought, 'They\nare all alike!' and answers, 'My heavens, I am an old woman, and perhaps\nwill never be confronted with that situation; one consideration,\nmoreover, must be kept in mind: the consideration of age, which prevents\nan older woman from ... with a very young boy ... (murmurs) ... that\nwould be horrible.' The staff doctor, 'I understand perfectly.' Several\nofficers, among them one who had paid court to her in her youth, laugh\nloudly, and the lady asks to be conducted to the chief physician, whom\nshe knows, so that everything may be arranged. At this she realizes with\ngreat dismay that she does not know his name. The staff officer,\nnevertheless, very politely and respectfully shows her the way to the\nsecond story, up a very narrow winding iron stairway which leads to the\nupper story directly from the door of the room. In going up she hears an\nofficer say, 'That is a tremendous decision irrespective of whether a\nwoman is young or old; all honor to her!'\n\"With the feeling that she is merely doing her duty, she goes up an\nendless staircase.\"\nThis dream she repeats twice in the course of a few weeks, with--as the\nlady notices--quite insignificant and very senseless changes.\nThis dream corresponds in its structure to a day dream. It has few gaps,\nand many of its individual points might have been elucidated as to\ncontent through inquiry, which, as you know, was omitted. The\nconspicuous and interesting point for us, however, is that the dream\nshows several gaps, gaps not of recollection, but of original content.\nIn three places the content is apparently obliterated, the speeches in\nwhich these gaps occur are interrupted by murmurs. Since we have\nperformed no analysis, we have, strictly speaking, also no right to make\nany assertion about the meaning of the dream. Yet there are intimations\ngiven from which something may be concluded. For example, the phrase\n\"services of love,\" and above all the bits of speech which immediately\nprecede the murmurs, demand a completion which can have but one meaning.\nIf we interpolate these, then the phantasy yields as its content the\nidea that the dreamer is ready, as an act of patriotic duty, to offer\nher person for the satisfaction of the erotic desires of the army,\nofficers as well as troops. That certainly is exceedingly shocking, it\nis an impudent libidinous phantasy, but--it does not occur in the dream\nat all. Just at the point where consistency would demand this\nconfession, there is a vague murmur in the manifest dream, something is\nlost or suppressed.\nI hope you will recognize the inevitability of the conclusion that it is\nthe shocking character of these places in the dream that was the motive\nfor their suppression. Yet where do you find a parallel for this state\nof affairs? In these times you need not seek far. Take up any political\npaper and you will find that the text is obliterated here and there, and\nthat in its place shimmers the white of the paper. You know that that is\nthe work of the newspaper censor. In these blank spaces something was\nprinted which was not to the liking of the censorship authorities, and\nfor that reason it was crossed out. You think that it is a pity, that it\nprobably was the most interesting part, it was \"the best part.\"\nIn other places the censorship did not touch the completed sentence. The\nauthor foresaw what parts might be expected to meet with the objection\nof the censor, and for that reason he softened them by way of\nprevention, modified them slightly, or contented himself with innuendo\nand allusion to what really wanted to flow from his pen. Thus the sheet,\nit is true, has no blank spaces, but from certain circumlocutions and\nobscurities of expression you will be able to guess that thoughts of the\ncensorship were the restraining motive.\nNow let us keep to this parallel. We say that the omitted dream\nspeeches, which were disguised by a murmuring, were also sacrifices to a\ncensorship. We actually speak of a _dream censor_ to which we may\nascribe a contributing part in the dream distortion. Wherever there are\ngaps in the manifest dream, it is the fault of the dream censor. Indeed,\nwe should go further, and recognize each time as a manifestation of the\ndream censor, those places at which a dream element is especially faint,\nindefinitely and doubtfully recalled among other, more clearly\ndelineated portions. But it is only rarely that this censorship\nmanifests itself so undisguisedly, so naively one may say, as in the\nexample of the dream of the \"services of love.\" Far more frequently the\ncensorship manifests itself according to the second type, through the\nproduction of weakenings, innuendoes, allusions instead of direct\ntruthfulness.\nFor a third type of dream censorship I know of no parallel in the\npractice of newspaper censorship, yet it is just this type that I can\ndemonstrate by the only dream example which we have so far analyzed. You\nwill remember the dream of the \"three bad theatre tickets for one florin\nand a half.\" In the latent thoughts of this dream, the element\n\"_precipitately, too soon_,\" stood in the foreground. It means: \"It was\nfoolish to marry so _early_, it was also foolish to buy theatre tickets\nso _early_, it was ridiculous of the sister-in-law to spend her money so\n_hastily_, merely to buy an ornament.\" Nothing of this central element\nof the dream thought was evident in the manifest dream. In the latter,\ngoing to the theatre and getting the tickets were shoved into the\nforeground. Through this displacement of the emphasis, this regrouping\nof the elements of the content, the manifest dream becomes so dissimilar\nfrom the latent dream thoughts that no one would suspect the latter\nbehind the former. This displacement of emphasis is a favorite device of\nthe dream distortion and gives the dream that strangeness which makes\nthe dreamer himself unwilling to recognize it as his own production.\nOmission, modification, regrouping of the material, these, then, are the\neffects of the dream censor and the devices of dream distortion. The\ndream censorship itself is the author, or one of the authors, of the\ndream distortion whose investigation now occupies us. Modification and\nrearrangement we are already accustomed to summarize as _displacement_.\nAfter these remarks concerning the effects of the dream censor, let us\nnow turn to their dynamics. I hope you will not consider the expression\ntoo anthropomorphically, and picture the dream censor as a severe little\nmanikin who lives in a little brain chamber and there performs his\nduties; nor should you attempt to localize him too much, to think of a\nbrain center from which his censoring influence emanates, and which\nwould cease with the injury or extirpation of this center. For the\npresent, the term \"dream censor\" is no more than a very convenient\nphrase for a dynamic relationship. This phrase does not prevent us from\nasking by what tendencies such influence is exerted and upon which\ntendencies it works; nor will we be surprised to discover that we have\nalready encountered the dream censor before, perhaps without recognizing\nhim.\nFor such was actually the case. You will remember that we had a\nsurprising experience when we began to apply our technique of free\nassociation. We then began to feel that some sort of a resistance\nblocked our efforts to proceed from the dream element to the unconscious\nelement for which the former is the substitute. This resistance, we\nsaid, may be of varying strength, enormous at one time, quite negligible\nat another. In the latter case we need cross only a few intermediate\nsteps in our work of interpretation. But when the resistance is strong,\nthen we must go through a long chain of associations, are taken far\nafield and must overcome all the difficulties which present themselves\nas critical objections to the association technique. What we met with in\nthe work of interpretation, we must now bring into the dream work as\nthe dream censor. The resistance to interpretation is nothing but the\nobjectivation of the dream censor. The latter proves to us that the\nforce of the censor has not spent itself in causing the dream\ndistortion, has not since been extinguished, but that this censorship\ncontinues as a permanent institution with the purpose of preserving the\ndistortion. Moreover, just as in the interpretation the strength of the\nresistance varied with each element, so also the distortion produced by\nthe censor in the same dream is of varying magnitude for each element.\nIf one compares the manifest with the latent dream one sees that certain\nisolated latent elements have been practically eliminated, others more\nor less modified, and still others left unchanged, indeed, have perhaps\nbeen taken over into the dream content with additional strength.\nBut we wanted to discover what purposes the censorship serves and\nagainst which tendencies it acts. This question, which is fundamental to\nthe understanding of the dream, indeed perhaps to human life, is easily\nanswered if we look over a series of those dreams which have been\nanalyzed. The tendencies which the censorship exercises are those which\nare recognized by the waking judgment of the dreamer, those with which\nhe feels himself in harmony. You may rest assured that when you reject\nan accurate interpretation of a dream of your own, you do so with the\nsame motives with which the dream censor works, the motives with which\nit produces the dream distortion and makes the interpretation necessary.\nRecall the dream of our fifty-year old lady. Without having interpreted\nit, she considers her dream abominable, would have been still more\noutraged if our informant had told her anything about the indubitable\nmeaning; and it is just on account of this condemnation that the\nshocking spots in her dream were replaced by a murmur.\nThe tendencies, however, against which the dream censor directs itself,\nmust now be described from the standpoint of this instance. One can say\nonly that these tendencies are of an objectionable nature throughout,\nthat they are shocking from an ethical, aesthetic and social point of\nview, that they are things one does not dare even to think, or thinks of\nonly with abhorrence. These censored wishes which have attained to a\ndistorted expression in the dream, are above all expressions of a\nboundless, reckless egoism. And indeed, the personal ego occurs in\nevery dream to play the major part in each of them, even if it can\nsuccessfully disguise itself in the manifest content. This _sacro\negoismo_ of the dream is surely not unconnected with the sleep-inducing\ncessation of psychic activity which consists, it should be noted, in the\nwithdrawal of interest from the entire external world.\nThe ego which has been freed of all ethical restraints feels itself in\naccord with all the demands of the sexual striving, with those demands\nwhich have long since been condemned by our aesthetic rearing, demands\nof such a character that they resist all our moral demands for\nrestraint. The pleasure-striving--the libido, as we term it--chooses its\nobjects without inhibitions, and indeed, prefers those that are\nforbidden. It chooses not only the wife of another, but, above all,\nthose incestuous objects declared sacred by the agreement of\nmankind--the mother and sister in the man's case, the father and brother\nin the woman's. Even the dream of our fifty-year old lady is an\nincestuous one, its libido unmistakably directed toward her son. Desires\nwhich we believe to be far from human nature show themselves strong\nenough to arouse dreams. Hate, too, expends itself without restraint.\nRevenge and murderous wishes toward those standing closest to the\ndreamer are not unusual, toward those best beloved in daily life, toward\nparents, brothers and sisters, toward one's spouse and one's own\nchildren. These censored wishes seem to arise from a veritable hell; no\ncensorship seems too harsh to be applied against their waking\ninterpretation.\nBut do not reproach the dream itself for this evil content. You will\nnot, I am sure, forget that the dream is charged with the harmless,\nindeed the useful function of guarding sleep from disturbance. This evil\ncontent, then, does not lie in the nature of the dream. You know also\nthat there are dreams which can be recognized as the satisfaction of\njustified wishes and urgent bodily needs. These, to be sure, undergo no\ndream distortion. They need none. They can satisfy their function\nwithout offending the ethical and aesthetic tendencies of the ego. And\nwill you also keep in mind the fact that the amount of dream distortion\nis proportional to two factors. On the one hand, the worse the\ncensorable wish, the greater the distortion; on the other hand, however,\nthe stricter the censor himself is at any particular time the greater\nthe distortion will be also. A young, strictly reared and prudish girl\nwill, by reason of those factors, disfigure with an inexorable\ncensorship those dream impulses which we physicians, for example, and\nwhich the dreamer herself ten years later, would recognize as\npermissible, harmless, libidinous desires.\nBesides, we are far from being at the point where we can allow ourselves\nto be shocked by the results of our work of interpretation. I think we\nare not yet quite adept at it; and above all there lies upon us the\nobligation to secure it against certain attacks. It is not at all\ndifficult to \"find a hitch\" in it. Our dream interpretations were made\non the hypotheses we accepted a little while ago, that the dream has\nsome meaning, that from the hypnotic to the normal sleep one may carry\nover the idea of the existence at such times of an unconscious psychic\nactivity, and that all associations are predetermined. If we had come to\nplausible results on the basis of these hypotheses, we would have been\njustified in concluding that the hypotheses were correct. But what is to\nbe done when the results are what I have just pictured them to be? Then\nit surely is natural to say, \"These results are impossible, foolish, at\nleast very improbable, hence there must have been something wrong with\nthe hypotheses. Either the dream is no psychic phenomenon after all, or\nthere is no such thing as unconscious mental activity in the normal\ncondition, or our technique has a gap in it somewhere. Is that not a\nsimpler and more satisfying conclusion than the abominations which we\npretend to have disclosed on the basis of our suppositions?\"\nBoth, I answer. It is a simpler as well as a more satisfying conclusion,\nbut not necessarily more correct for that reason. Let us take our time,\nthe matter is not yet ripe for judgment. Above all we can strengthen the\ncriticism against our dream interpretation still further. That its\nconclusions are so unpleasant and unpalatable is perhaps of secondary\nimportance. A stronger argument is the fact that the dreamers to whom we\nascribe such wish-tendencies from the interpretation of their dreams\nreject the interpretations most emphatically, and with good reason.\n\"What,\" says the one, \"you want to prove to me by this dream that I\nbegrudged the sums which I spent for my sister's trousseau and my\nbrother's education? But indeed that can't be so. Why I work only for my\nsister, I have no interest in life but to fulfill my duties toward her,\nas being the oldest child, I promised our blessed mother I would.\" Or a\nwoman says of her dream, \"You mean to say that I wish my husband were\ndead! Why, that is simply revolting, nonsense. It isn't only that we\nhave the happiest possible married life, you probably won't believe me\nwhen I tell you so, but his death would deprive me of everything else\nthat I own in the world.\" Or another will tell us, \"You mean that I have\nsensual desires toward my sister? That is ridiculous. I am not in the\nleast fond of her. We don't get along and I haven't exchanged a word\nwith her in years.\" We might perhaps ignore this sort of thing if the\ndreamers did not confirm or deny the tendencies ascribed to them; we\ncould say that they are matters which the dreamers do not know about\nthemselves. But that the dreamers should feel the exact opposite of the\nascribed wish, and should be able to prove to us the dominance of the\nopposite tendency--this fact must finally disconcert us. Is it not time\nto lay aside the whole work of the dream interpretation as something\nwhose results reduce it to absurdity?\nBy no means; this stronger argument breaks down when we attack it\ncritically. Assuming that there are unconscious tendencies in the\npsychic life, nothing is proved by the ability of the subject to show\nthat their opposites dominate his conscious life. Perhaps there is room\nin the psychic life even for antithetical tendencies, for contradictions\nwhich exist side by side, yes, possibly it is just the dominance of the\none impulse which is the necessary condition for the unconsciousness of\nits opposite. The first two objections raised against our work hold\nmerely that the results of dream interpretation are not simple, and very\nunpleasant. In answer to the first of these, one may say that for all\nyour enthusiasm for the simple solution, you cannot thereby solve a\nsingle dream problem. To do so you must make up your mind to accept the\nfact of complicated relationships. And to the second of these objections\none may say that you are obviously wrong to use a preference or a\ndislike as the basis for a scientific judgment. What difference does it\nmake if the results of the dream interpretation seem unpleasant, even\nembarrassing and disgusting to you? \"That doesn't prevent them from\nexisting,\" as I used to hear my teacher Charcot say in similar cases,\nwhen I was a young doctor. One must be humble, one must keep personal\npreferences and antipathies in the background, if one wishes to\ndiscover the realities of the world. If a physicist can prove to you\nthat the organic life of this planet must, within a short period of\ntime, become completely extinct, do you also venture to say to him,\n\"That cannot be so. This prospect is too unpleasant.\" On the contrary,\nyou will be silent until another physicist proves some error in the\nassumptions or calculations of the first. If you reject the unpleasant,\nyou are repeating the mechanism of dream construction instead of\nunderstanding and mastering it.\nPerhaps you will promise to overlook the repulsive character of the\ncensored dream-wishes, and will take refuge in the argument that it is\nimprobable, after all, that so wide a field be given over to the evil in\nthe constitution of man. But does your own experience justify you in\nsaying that? I will not discuss the question of how you may estimate\nyourselves, but have you found so much good will among your superiors\nand rivals, so much chivalry among your enemies, so little envy in their\ncompany, that you feel yourselves in duty bound to enter a protest\nagainst the part played by the evil of egoism in human nature? Are you\nignorant of how uncontrolled and undependable the average human being is\nin all the affairs of sex life? Or do you not know that all the\nimmoralities and excesses of which we dream nightly are crimes committed\ndaily by waking persons? What else does psychoanalysis do here but\nconfirm the old saying of Plato, that the good people are those who\ncontent themselves with dreaming what the others, the bad people, really\ndo?\nAnd now turn your attention from the individual case to the great war\ndevastating Europe. Think of the amount of brutality, the cruelty and\nthe lies allowed to spread over the civilized world. Do you really\nbelieve that a handful of conscienceless egoists and corruptionists\ncould have succeeded in setting free all these evil spirits, if the\nmillions of followers did not share in the guilt? Do you dare under\nthese circumstances to break a lance for the absence of evil from the\npsychic constitution of mankind?\nYou will reproach me with judging the war one-sidedly, you will say that\nit has also brought forth all that is most beautiful and noble in\nmankind, its heroic courage, its self-sacrifice, its social feeling.\nCertainly, but do not at this point allow yourselves to become guilty of\nthe injustice which has so often been perpetrated against\npsychoanalysis, of reproaching it with denying one thing because it was\nasserting another. It is not our intention to deny the noble strivings\nof human nature, nor have we ever done anything to deprecate their\nvalue. On the contrary, I show you not only the censored evil\ndream-wishes, but also the censor which suppresses them and renders them\nunrecognizable. We dwell on the evil in mankind with greater emphasis\nonly because others deny it, a method whereby the psychic life of\nmankind does not become better, but merely incomprehensible. When,\nhowever, we give up this one-sided ethical estimate, we shall surely be\nable to find a more accurate formula for the relationship of the evil to\nthe good in human nature.\nAnd thus the matter stands. We need not give up the conclusions to which\nour labors in dream interpretation lead us even though we must consider\nthose conclusions strange. Perhaps we can approach their understanding\nlater by another path. For the present, let us repeat: dream distortion\nis a consequence of the censorship practised by accredited tendencies of\nthe ego against those wish-impulses that are in any way shocking,\nimpulses which stir in us nightly during sleep. Why these wish-impulses\ncome just at night, and whence they come--these are questions which will\nbear considerable investigation.\nIt would be a mistake, however, to omit to mention, with fitting\nemphasis, another result of these investigations. The dream wishes which\ntry to disturb our sleep are not known to us, in fact we learn of them\nfirst through the dream interpretation. Therefore, they may be described\nas \"at that time\" unconscious in the sense above defined. But we can go\nbeyond this and say that they are more than merely \"at that time\"\nunconscious. The dreamer to be sure denies their validity, as we have\nseen in so many cases, even after he has learned of their existence by\nmeans of the interpretation. The situation is then repeated which we\nfirst encountered in the interpretation of the tongue slip \"hiccough\"\nwhere the toastmaster was outraged and assured us that neither then nor\never before had he been conscious of disrespectful impulse toward his\nchief. This is repeated with every interpretation of a markedly\ndistorted dream, and for that reason attains a significance for our\nconception. We are now prepared to conclude that there are processes and\ntendencies in the psychic life of which one knows nothing at all, has\nknown nothing for some time, might, in fact, perhaps never have known\nanything. The unconscious thus receives a new meaning for us; the idea\nof \"at present\" or \"at a specific time\" disappears from its conception,\nfor it can also mean _permanently_ unconscious, not merely _latent at\nthe time_. Obviously we shall have to learn more of this at another\nsession.\nTENTH LECTURE\nTHE DREAM\n_Symbolism in the Dream_\nWe have discovered that the distortion of dreams, a disturbing element\nin our work of understanding them, is the result of a censorious\nactivity which is directed against the unacceptable of the unconscious\nwish-impulses. But, of course, we have not maintained that censorship is\nthe only factor which is to blame for the dream distortion, and we may\nactually make the discovery in a further study of the dream that other\nitems play a part in this result. That is, even if the dream censorship\nwere eliminated we might not be in a position to understand the dreams;\nthe actual dream still might not be identical with the latent dream\nthought.\nThis other item which makes the dream unintelligible, this new addition\nto dream distortion, we discover by considering a gap in our technique.\nI have already admitted that for certain elements of the dream, no\nassociations really occur to the person being analyzed. This does not\nhappen so often as the dreamers maintain; in many cases the association\ncan be forced by persistence. But still there are certain instances in\nwhich no association is forthcoming, or if forced does not furnish what\nwe expected. When this happens in the course of a psychoanalytic\ntreatment, then a particular meaning may be attached thereto, with which\nwe have nothing to do here. It also occurs, however, in the\ninterpretation of the dreams of a normal person or in interpreting one's\nown dreams. Once a person is convinced that in these cases no amount of\nforcing of associations will avail, he will finally make the discovery\nthat the unwished-for contingency occurs regularly in certain dream\nelements, and he will begin to recognize a new order of things there,\nwhere at first he believed he had come across a peculiar exception to\nour technique.\nIn this way we are tempted to interpret these silent dream elements\nourselves, to undertake their translation by the means at hand. The fact\nthat every time we trust to this substitution we obtain a satisfactory\nmeaning is forced upon us; until we resolve upon this decision the dream\nremains meaningless, its continuity is broken. The accumulation of many\nsimilar cases tends to give the necessary certainty to our first timid\nattempts.\nI am expounding all this in rather a schematic manner, but this is\npermissible for purposes of instruction, and I am not trying to\nmisstate, but only to simplify matters.\nIn this manner we derive constant translations for a whole series of\ndream elements just as constant translations are found in our popular\ndream books for all the things we dream. But do not forget that in our\nassociation technique we never discover constant substitutes for the\ndream elements.\nYou will say at once that this road to interpretation appears far more\nuncertain and open to objection than the former methods of free\nassociation. But a further fact is to be taken into consideration. After\none has gathered a sufficient number of such constant substitutes\nempirically, he will say that of his own knowledge he should actually\nhave denied that these items of dream interpretation could really be\nunderstood without the associations of the dreamer. The facts that force\nus to recognize their meaning will appear in the second half of our\nanalysis.\nWe call such a constant relationship between a dream element and its\ninterpretation _symbolic_. The dream element is itself a _symbol_ of the\nunconscious dream thought. You will remember that previously, when we\nwere investigating the relationship between dream elements and their\nactuality, I drew three distinctions, viz., that of the part of the\nwhole, that of the allusion, and that of the imagery. I then announced\nthat there was a fourth, but did not name it. This fourth is the\nsymbolic relationship here introduced. Very interesting discussions\ncenter about this, and we will now consider them before we express our\nown particular observations on symbolism. Symbolism is perhaps the most\nnoteworthy chapter of dream study.\nIn the first place, since symbols are permanent or constant\ntranslations, they realize, in a certain measure, the ideal of ancient\nas well as popular dream interpretation, an ideal which by means of our\ntechnique we had left behind. They permit us in certain cases to\ninterpret a dream without questioning the dreamer who, aside from this,\nhas no explanation for the symbol. If the interpreter is acquainted with\nthe customary dream symbols and, in addition, with the dreamer himself,\nthe conditions under which the latter lives and the impressions he\nreceived before having the dream, it is often possible to interpret a\ndream without further information--to translate it \"right off the bat.\"\nSuch a trick flatters the interpreter and impresses the dreamer; it\nstands out as a pleasurable incident in the usual arduous course of\ncross-examining the dreamer. But do not be misled. It is not our\nfunction to perform tricks. Interpretation based on a knowledge of\nsymbols is not a technique that can replace the associative technique,\nor even compare with it. It is a supplement to the associative\ntechnique, and furnishes the latter merely with transplanted, usable\nresults. But as regards familiarity with the dreamer's psychic\nsituation, you must consider the fact that you are not limited to\ninterpreting the dreams of acquaintances; that as a rule you are not\nacquainted with the daily occurrences which act as the stimuli for the\ndreams, and that the associations of the subject furnish you with a\nknowledge of that very thing we call the psychic situation.\nFurthermore, it is very extraordinary, particularly in view of\ncircumstances to be mentioned later, that the most vehement opposition\nhas been voiced against the existence of the symbolic relationship\nbetween the dream and the unconscious. Even persons of judgment and\nposition, who have otherwise made great progress in psychoanalysis, have\ndiscontinued their support at this point. This is the more remarkable\nsince, in the first place, symbolism is neither peculiar to the dream\nnor characteristic of it, and since in the second place, symbolism in\nthe dream was not discovered through psychoanalysis, although the latter\nis not poor otherwise in making startling discoveries. The discoverer of\ndream symbolism, if we insist on a discovery in modern times, was the\nphilosopher K. A. Scherner (1861). Psychoanalysis affirmed Scherner's\ndiscovery and modified it considerably.\nNow you will want to know something of the nature of dream symbolism,\nand to hear some examples. I shall gladly impart to you what I know, but\nI admit that our knowledge is not so complete as we could desire it to\nbe.\nThe nature of the symbol relationship is a comparison, but not any\ndesired comparison. One suspects a special prerequisite for this\ncomparison, but is unable to say what it is. Not everything to which we\nare able to compare an object or an occurrence occurs in the dream as\nits symbol; on the other hand, the dream does not symbolize anything we\nmay choose, but only specific elements of the dream thought. There are\nlimitations on both sides. It must be admitted that the idea of the\nsymbol cannot be sharply delimited at all times--it mingles with the\nsubstitution, dramatization, etc., even approaches the allusion. In one\nseries of symbols the basic comparison is apparent to the senses. On the\nother hand, there are other symbols which raise the question of where\nthe similarity, the \"something intermediate\" of this suspected\ncomparison is to be sought. We may discover it by more careful\nconsideration, or it may remain hidden to us. Furthermore, it is\nextraordinary, if the symbol is a comparison, that this comparison is\nnot revealed by the association, that the dreamer is not acquainted with\nthe comparison, that he makes use of it without knowing of its\nexistence. Indeed, the dreamer does not even care to admit the validity\nof this comparison when it is pointed out to him. So you see, a symbolic\nrelationship is a comparison of a very special kind, the origin of which\nis not yet clearly understood by us. Perhaps later we may find\nreferences to this unknown factor.\nThe number of things that find symbolic representation in the dream is\nnot great--the human body as a whole, parents, children, brothers and\nsisters, birth, death, nakedness and a few others. The only typical,\nthat is, regular representation of the human person as a whole is in the\nform of a _house_, as was recognized by Scherner who, indeed, wished to\ncredit this symbol with an overwhelming significance which it does not\ndeserve. It occurs in dreams that a person, now lustful, now frightened,\nclimbs down the fronts of houses. Those with entirely smooth walls are\nmen; but those which are provided with projections and balconies to\nwhich one can hold on, are women. Parents appear in the dream as _king_\nand _queen_, or other persons highly respected. The dream in this\ninstance is very pious. It treats children, and brothers and sisters,\nless tenderly; they are symbolized as _little animals_ or _vermin_.\nBirth is almost regularly represented by some reference to _water_;\neither one plunges into the water or climbs out of it, or rescues\nsomeone from the water, or is himself rescued from it, i.e., there is a\nmother-relation to the person. Death is replaced in the dream by _taking\na journey, riding in a train_; _being dead, by various darksome, timid\nsuggestions_; _nakedness, by clothes_ and _uniforms_. You see here how\nthe lines between symbolic and suggestive representation merge one into\nanother.\nIn contrast to the paucity of this enumeration, it is a striking fact\nthat the objects and subject matter of another sphere are represented by\nan extraordinarily rich symbolism. This is the sphere of the sexual\nlife, the genitals, the sex processes and sexual intercourse. The great\nmajority of symbols in the dream are sex symbols. A remarkable\ndisproportion results from this fact. The designated subject matters are\nfew, their symbols extraordinarily profuse, so that each of these\nobjects can be expressed by any number of symbols of almost equal value.\nIn the interpretation something is disclosed that arouses universal\nobjection. The symbol interpretations, in contrast to the many-sidedness\nof the dream representations, are very monotonous--this displeases all\nwho deal with them; but what is one to do?\nSince this is the first time in these lectures that we speak of the\nsexual life, I must tell you the manner in which I intend to handle this\ntheme. Psychoanalysis sees no reason for hiding matters or treating them\nby innuendo, finds no necessity of being ashamed of dealing with this\nimportant subject, believes it is proper and decent to call everything\nby its correct name, and hopes most effectively in this manner to ward\noff disturbing or salacious thoughts. The fact that I am talking before\na mixed audience can make no difference on this point. Just as there is\nno special knowledge either for the Delphic oracle or for flappers, so\nthe ladies present among you have, by their appearance in this lecture\nhall, made it clear that they wish to be considered on the same basis as\nthe men.\nThe dream has a number of representations for the male genital that may\nbe called symbolic, and in which the similarity of the comparison is,\nfor the most part, very enlightening. In the first place, the holy\nfigure 3 is a symbolical substitute for the entire male genital. The\nmore conspicuous and more interesting part of the genital to both sexes,\nthe male organ, has symbolical substitute in objects of like form, those\nwhich are long and upright, such as _sticks_, _umbrellas_, _poles_,\n_trees_, etc. It is also symbolized by objects that have the\ncharacteristic, in common with it, of penetration into the body and\nconsequent injury, hence pointed _weapons_ of every type, _knives_,\n_daggers_, _lances_, _swords_, and in the same manner _firearms_,\n_guns_, _pistols_ and the _revolver_, which is so suitable because of\nits shape. In the troubled dream of the young girl, pursuit by a man\nwith a knife or a firearm plays a big role. This, probably the most\nfrequent dream symbolism, is easily translatable. Easily comprehensible,\ntoo, is the substitution for the male member of objects out of which\nwater flows: _faucets_, _water cans_, _fountains_, as well as its\nrepresentation by other objects that have the power of elongation, such\nas _hanging lamps_, _collapsible pencils_, etc. That _pencils_,\n_quills_, _nail files_, _hammers_ and other _instruments_ are\nundoubtedly male symbols is a fact connected with a conception of the\norgan, which likewise is not far to seek.\nThe extraordinary characteristic of the member of being able to raise\nitself against the force of gravity, one of the phenomena of erection,\nleads to symbolic representations by _balloons_, _aeroplanes_, and more\nrecently, _Zeppelins_. The dream has another far more expressive way of\nsymbolizing erection. It makes the sex organ the essential part of the\nwhole person and pictures the person himself as _flying_. Do not feel\ndisturbed because the dreams of flying, often so beautiful, and which we\nall have had, must be interpreted as dreams of general sexual\nexcitement, as erection dreams. P. Federn, among the psychoanalytical\nstudents, has confirmed this interpretation beyond any doubt, and even\nMourly Vold, much praised for his sobriety, who carried on his dream\nexperiments with artificial positions of the arms and legs, and who was\nreally opposed to psychoanalysis--perhaps knew nothing about\npsychoanalysis--has come to the same conclusion as a result of his\nresearch. It is no objection to this conclusion that women may have the\nsame dreams of flying. Remember that our dreams act as wish-fulfillments,\nand that the wish to be a man is often present in women, consciously or\nunconsciously. And the fact that it is possible for a woman to realize\nthis wish by the same sensation as a man does, will not mislead anyone\nacquainted with anatomy. There is a small organ in the genitals of a\nwoman similar to that of the male, and this small organ, the clitoris,\neven in childhood, and in the years before sexual intercourse, plays\nthe same role as does the large organ of the male.\nTo the less comprehensible male sex-symbols belong certain _reptiles_\nand _fish_, notably the famous symbol of the _snake_. Why _hats_ and\n_cloaks_ should have been turned to the same use is certainly difficult\nto discover, but their symbolic meaning leaves no room for doubt. And\nfinally the question may be raised whether possibly the substitution of\nsome other member as a representation for the male organ may not be\nregarded as symbolic. I believe that one is forced to this conclusion by\nthe context and by the female counterparts.\nThe female genital is symbolically represented by all those objects\nwhich share its peculiarity of enclosing a space capable of being filled\nby something--viz., by _pits_, _caves_, and _hollows_, by _pitchers_ and\n_bottles_, by _boxes_ and _trunks_, _jars_, _cases_, _pockets_, etc. The\n_ship_, too, belongs in this category. Many symbols represent the womb\nof the mother rather than the female genital, as _wardrobes_, _stoves_,\nand primarily a _room_. The room-symbolism is related to the\nhouse-symbol, _doors_ and _entrances_ again become symbolic of the\ngenital opening. But materials, too, are symbols of the woman--_wood_,\n_paper_, and objects that are made of these materials, such as _tables_\nand _books_. Of animals, at least the _snail_ and _mussel_ are\nunmistakably recognizable as symbols for the female; of parts of the\nbody the _mouth_ takes the place of the genital opening, while\n_churches_ and _chapels_ are structural symbolisms. As you see, all of\nthese symbols are not equally comprehensible.\nThe breasts must be included in the genitals, and like the larger\nhemispheres of the female body are represented by _apples_, _peaches_\nand _fruits_ in general. The pubic hair growth of both sexes appears in\nthe dream as _woods_ and _bushes_. The complicated topography of the\nfemale genitals accounts for the fact that they are often represented as\nscenes with _cliffs_, _woods_ and _water_, while the imposing mechanism\nof the male sex apparatus leads to the use of all manner of very\ncomplicated _machinery_, difficult to describe.\nA noteworthy symbol of the female genital is also the _jewel-casket_;\n_jewels_ and _treasure_ are also representatives of the beloved person\nin the dream; _sweets_ frequently occur as representatives of sexual\ndelights. The satisfaction in one's own genital is suggested by all\ntypes of _play_, in which may be included _piano-playing_. Exquisite\nsymbolic representations of _onanism_ are _sliding_ and _coasting_ as\nwell as _tearing off a branch_. A particularly remarkable dream symbol\nis that of having _one's_ _teeth fall out_, or _having them pulled_.\nCertainly its most immediate interpretation is castration as a\npunishment for onanism. Special representations for the relations of the\nsexes are less numerous in the dream than we might have expected from\nthe foregoing. Rhythmic activities, such as _dancing_, _riding_ and\n_climbing_ may be mentioned, also harrowing experiences, such as _being\nrun over_. One may include certain _manual activities_, and, of course,\n_being threatened with weapons_.\nYou must not imagine that either the use or the translation of these\nsymbols is entirely simple. All manner of unexpected things are\ncontinually happening. For example, it seems hardly believable that in\nthese symbolic representations the sex differences are not always\nsharply distinguished. Many symbols represent a genital in general,\nregardless of whether male or female, e.g., the _little child_, the\n_small son_ or _daughter_. It sometimes occurs that a predominantly male\nsymbol is used for a female genital, or vice versa. This is not\nunderstood until one has acquired an insight into the development of the\nsexual representations of mankind. In many instances this double meaning\nof symbols may be only apparent; the most striking of the symbols, such\nas _weapons_, _pockets_ and _boxes_ are excluded from this bisexual\nusage.\nI should now like to give a summary, from the point of view of the\nsymbols rather than of the thing represented, of the field out of which\nthe sex symbols are for the most part taken, and then to make a few\nremarks about the symbols which have points in common that are not\nunderstood. An obscure symbol of this type is the _hat_, perhaps\nheaddress on the whole, and is usually employed as a male\nrepresentation, though at times as a female. In the same way the _cloak_\nrepresents a man, perhaps not always the genital aspect. You are at\nliberty to ask, why? The _cravat_, which is suspended and is not worn by\nwomen, is an unmistakable male symbol. _White laundry_, all _linen_, in\nfact, is female. _Dresses_, _uniforms_ are, as we have already seen,\nsubstitutes for nakedness, for body-formation; the _shoe_ or _slipper_\nis a female genital. _Tables_ and _wood_ have already been mentioned as\npuzzling but undoubtedly female symbols. _Ladders_, _ascents_, _steps_\nin relation to their mounting, are certainly symbols of sexual\nintercourse. On closer consideration we see that they have the rhythm of\nwalking as a common characteristic; perhaps, too, the heightening of\nexcitement and the shortening of the breath, the higher one mounts.\nWe have already spoken of _natural scenery_ as a representation of the\nfemale genitals. _Mountains_ and _cliffs_ are symbols of the male organ;\nthe _garden_ a frequent symbol of the female genitals. _Fruit_ does not\nstand for the child, but for the breasts. _Wild animals_ signify\nsensually aroused persons, or further, base impulses, passions.\n_Blossoms_ and _flowers_ represent the female genitals, or more\nparticularly, virginity. Do not forget that the blossoms are really the\ngenitals of the plants.\nWe already know the _room_ as a symbol. The representation may be\nextended in that the windows, entrances and exits of the room take on\nthe meaning of the body openings. Whether the room is _open_ or _closed_\nis a part of this symbolism, and the _key_ that opens it is an\nunmistakable male symbol.\nThis is the material of dream symbolism. It is not complete and might be\ndeepened as well as extended. But I am of the opinion it will seem more\nthan enough to you, perhaps will make you reluctant. You will ask, \"Do I\nreally live in the midst of sex symbols? Are all the objects that\nsurround me, all the clothes I put on, all the things that I touch,\nalways sex symbols, and nothing else?\" There really are sufficient\ngrounds for such questions, and the first is, \"Where, in fact, are we to\nfind the meaning of these dream symbols if the dreamer himself can give\nno information concerning them, or at best can give only incomplete\ninformation?\"\nMy answer is: \"From many widely different sources, from fairy tales and\nmyths, jokes and farces, from folklore, that is, the knowledge of the\ncustoms, usages, sayings and songs of peoples, from the poetic and\nvulgar language. Everywhere we find the same symbolism and in many of\nthese instances we understand them without further information. If we\nfollow up each of these sources separately we shall find so many\nparallels to the dream symbolism that we must believe in the correctness\nof our interpretations.\"\nThe human body, we have said, is, according to Scherner, frequently\nsymbolized in the dream by the house. Continuing this representation,\nthe windows, doors and entrances are the entrances into the body\ncavities, the facades are smooth or provided with balconies and\nprojections to which to hold. The same symbolism is to be found in our\ndaily speech when we greet a good friend as \"_old house_\" or when we say\nof someone, \"We'll hit him in the _belfry_,\" or maintain of another that\nhe's not quite right in the _upper story_. In anatomy the body openings\nare sometimes called the _body-portals_.\nThe fact that we meet our parents in the dream as imperial or royal\npersons is at first surprising. But it has its parallel in the fairy\ntale. Doesn't it begin to dawn upon us that the many fairy tales which\nbegin \"Once upon a time there was a _king_ and a _queen_\" intend nothing\nelse than, \"Once there was a _father_ and a _mother_?\" In our families\nwe refer to our children as _princes_, the eldest as the _crown-prince_.\nThe king usually calls himself the _father of the country_. We playfully\ndesignate little children as _worms_, and say, sympathetically, \"_poor\nlittle worm_.\"\nLet us return to the symbolism of the house. When we use the projections\nof the house to hold ourselves on to in the dream, are we not reminded\nof the familiar colloquialism about persons with well-developed breasts:\n\"She has something to _hold onto_\"? The folk express this in still\nanother way when it says, \"there's lots of _wood in front of her\nhouse_\"; as though it wished to come to the aid of our interpretation\nthat wood is a feminine, maternal symbol.\nIn addition to wood there are others. We might not understand how this\nmaterial has come to be a substitute for the maternal, the feminine.\nHere our comparison of languages may be helpful. The German word _Holz_\n(wood) is said to be from the same stem as the Greek word, nle,\nwhich means stuff, raw material. This is an example of the case, not\nentirely unusual, where a general word for material finally is\nexclusively used for some special material. There is an island in the\nocean, known by the name of Madeira. The Portuguese gave it this name at\nthe time of its discovery because it was at that time entirely covered\nwith forests, for in the language of the Portuguese, Madeira means\n_wood_. You will recognize, however, that Madeira, is nothing else than\nthe slightly changed Latin word _materia_ which again has the general\nmeaning of _material_ Material is derived from _mater_, mother. The\nmaterial out of which something is made, is at the same time its\nmother-part. In the symbolic use of wood for woman, mother, this ancient\nconception still lives.\nBirth is regularly expressed in dreams by some connection with water;\none plunges into the water, or comes out of the water, which means one\ngives birth to, or is born. Now let us not forget that this symbol may\nrefer in two ways to the truths of evolutionary history. Not alone have\nall land-mammals, including the ancestors of man, developed out of water\nanimals--this is the ultimate fact--but every single mammal, every human\nbeing, lived the first part of his existence in the water--namely, lived\nin the body of his mother as an embryo in the amniotic fluid and came\nout of the water at the time of his birth. I do not wish to maintain\nthat the dreamer knows this, on the contrary I hold that he does not\nhave to know. The dreamer very likely knows some things because of the\nfact that he was told about them in his childhood, and for that very\nreason I maintain that this knowledge has played no part in the\nconstruction of his symbols. He was told in childhood that the stork\nbrought him--but where did it get him? Out of a lake, out of the\nwell--again, out of the water. One of my patients to whom such\ninformation had been given, a little count, disappeared for a whole\nafternoon. Finally he was discovered lying at the edge of the palace\nlake, his little face bent above the water and earnestly peering into it\nto see if he could not see the little children at the bottom.\nIn the myths of the birth of the hero, which O. Rank submitted to\ncomparative examination,--the oldest is that of King Sargon of Agade,\nabout 2800 B.C.--exposure in the water and rescue from water play a\npredominating role. Rank has recognized that these are representations\nof birth, analogous to those customary in dreams. When a person in his\ndream rescues another from the water, the latter becomes his mother, or\njust plainly mother; in the myth a person who rescues a child out of the\nwater professes herself as the real mother of the child. In a well-known\njoke the intelligent Jewish boy is asked who was the mother of Moses. He\nanswered without hesitation, the Princess. But no, he is told, she only\ntook him out of the water. \"That's what _she says_,\" is his reply, and\nthereby he shows that he has found the correct interpretation of the\nmyth.\nLeaving on a trip represents death in the dream. Likewise it is the\ncustom in the nursery when a child asks where someone who has died, and\nwhom he misses, may be, to say to him that the absent one has taken a\ntrip. Again I should like to deny the truth of the belief that the dream\nsymbol originates in this evasion used for the benefit of children. The\npoet makes use of the same symbol when he speaks of the Hereafter as\n\"that undiscovered bourne from which no _traveler_ returns.\" Even in\neveryday speech it is customary to refer to the last journey. Every\nperson acquainted with ancient rite knows how seriously, for example,\nthe Egyptians considered the portrayal of a journey to the land of the\ndead. There still exist many copies of the \"death book\" which was given\nto the mummy for this journey as a sort of Baedeker. Since the burial\nplaces have been separated from the living quarters, the last journey of\nthe dead person has become a reality.\nIn the same manner the genital symbolism is just as little peculiar to\nthe dream alone. Every one of you has perhaps at some time or other been\nso unkind as to call some woman an \"_old casket_\" without perhaps being\naware that he was using a genital symbol. In the New Testament one may\nread \"Woman is a weak _vessel_.\" The Holy Scriptures of the Jews, so\nnearly poetic in their style, are filled with sex-symbolic expressions\nwhich have not always been correctly understood, and the true\nconstruction of which, in the _Song of Songs_, for example, has led to\nmany misunderstandings. In the later Hebraic literature the\nrepresentation of woman as a house, the door taking the place of the sex\nopening, is very widespread. The man complains, for instance, when he\ndiscovers a lack of virginity, that he has found _the door open_. The\nsymbol of the table for woman is also known to this literature. The\nwoman says of her husband, \"I set the table for him, _but he upset it_.\"\nLame children are supposed to result from the fact that the man has\n_overturned the table_. I take these examples from a work by L. Levy of\nBruenn, _The Sexual Symbolism of the Bible and the Talmud_.\nThat ships, too, represent women in dreams is a belief derived from the\netymologists, who maintain \"ship\" was originally the name of an earthen\nvessel and is the same word as _Schaff_ (to create). The Greek myth of\nPeriander of Corinth and his wife Melissa is proof that the stove or\noven is a woman, and a womb. When, according to Herodotus, the tyrant\nentreated the shade of his beloved wife, whom, however, he had murdered\nin a fit of jealousy, for some sign of its identity, the deceased\nidentified herself by the reminder that he, _Periander_, _had thrust his\nbread into a cold oven_, as a disguise for an occurrence that could have\nbeen known to no other person. In the _Anthropophyteia_ published by F.\nS. Krauss, an indispensable source book for everything that has to do\nwith the sex life of nations, we read that in a certain German region it\nis commonly said of a woman who has just been delivered of a child,\n\"_Her oven has caved in_.\" The making of a fire and everything connected\ntherewith is filled through and through with sex symbolism. The flame is\nalways the male genital, the fireplace, the hearth, is the womb of the\nwoman.\nIf you have often wondered why it is that landscapes are so often used\nto represent the female genitals in the dream, then let the mythologist\nteach you the role Mother Earth has played in the symbolisms and cults\nof ancient times. You may be tempted to say that a room represents a\nwoman in the dream because of the German colloquialism which uses the\nterm _Frauenzimmer_ instead of _Frau_, in other words, it substitutes\nfor the human person the idea of that room that is set aside for her\nexclusive use. In like manner we speak of the _Sublime Porte_, and mean\nthe Sultan and his government; furthermore, the name of the ancient\nEgyptian ruler, Pharaoh, means nothing other than \"great court room.\"\n(In the ancient Orient the court yards between the double gates of the\ntown were the gathering places of the people, in the same manner as the\nmarket place was in the classical world.) What I mean is, this\nderivation is far too superficial. It seems more probable to me that the\nroom, as the space surrounding man, came to be the symbol of woman. We\nhave seen that the house is used in such a representation; from\nmythology and poetry we may take the _city_, _fortress_, _palace_,\n_citadel_, as further symbols of woman. The question may easily be\ndecided by the dreams of those persons who do not speak German and do\nnot understand it. In the last few years my patients have been\npredominantly foreign-language speaking, and I think I can recall that\nin their dreams as well the room represents woman, even where they had\nno analogous usages in their languages. There are still other signs\nwhich show that the symbolization is not limited by the bounds of\nlanguage, a fact that even the old dream investigator, Schubert (1862)\nmaintained. Since none of my dreamers were totally ignorant of German I\nmust leave this differentiation to those psychoanalysts who can gather\nexamples in other lands where the people speak but one language.\nAmong the symbol-representations of the male genital there is scarcely\none that does not recur in jokes or in vulgar or poetical usage,\nespecially among the old classical poets. Not alone do those symbols\ncommonly met with in dreams appeal here, but also new ones, e.g., the\nworking materials of various performances, foremost of which is the\nincantation. Furthermore, we approach in the symbolic representation of\nthe male a very extended and much discussed province, which we shall\navoid for economic reasons. I should like to make a few remarks,\nhowever, about one of the unclassified symbols--the figure 3. Whether or\nnot this figure derives its holiness from its symbolic meaning may\nremain undecided. But it appears certain that many objects which occur\nin nature as three-part things derive their use as coats-of-arms and\nemblems from such symbolic meaning, e.g., the clover, likewise the\nthree-part French lily, (fleur-de-lys), and the extraordinary\ncoats-of-arms of two such widely separated islands as Sicily and the\nIsle of Man, where the Triskeles (three partly bended knees, emerging\nfrom a central point) are merely said to be the portrayal in a different\nform of the male genitals. Copies of the male member were used in\nantiquity as the most powerful charms (_Apotropaea_) against evil\ninfluences, and this is connected with the fact that the lucky amulets\nof our own time may one and all be recognized as genital or sex-symbols.\nLet us study such a collection, worn in the form of little silver\npendants: the four-leaf clover, a pig, a mushroom, a horse-shoe, a\nladder, a chimney-sweep. The four-leaf clover, it seems, has usurped the\nplace of the three-leaf clover, which is really more suitable as a\nsymbol; the pig is an ancient symbol of fertility; the mushroom is an\nunquestionable penis symbol--there are mushrooms that derive their\nsystematic names from their unmistakable similarity to the male member\n(Phallus impudicus); the horseshoe recalls the contour of the female\ngenital opening; and the chimney sweep who carries a ladder belongs in\nthis company because he carries on that trade with which the\nsex-intercourse is vulgarly compared (_cf._ the _Anthropophyteia_). We\nhave already become acquainted with his ladder as a sex symbol in the\ndream; the German usage is helpful here, it shows us how the verb \"to\nmount\"[30] is made use of in an exquisite sexual sense. We use the\nexpressions \"_to run after women_,\" which literally translated would be\n\"_to climb after women_,\" and \"_an old climber_.\"[31] In French, where\n\"_step_\" is \"_la marche_\" we find that the analogous expression for a\nman about town is \"_un vieux marcheur_.\" It is apparently not unknown in\nthis connection that the sexual intercourse of many of the larger\nanimals requires a mounting, _a climbing upon_ the female.\nThe tearing off of a branch as the symbolic representation of onanism is\nnot alone in keeping with the vulgar representation of the fact of\nonanism, but has far-reaching mythological parallels. Especially\nnoteworthy, however, is the representation of onanism, or rather the\npunishment therefor, castration, by the falling out or pulling out of\nteeth, because there is a parallel in folk-lore which is probably known\nto the fewest dreamers. It does not seem at all questionable to me that\nthe practice of circumcision common among so many peoples is an\nequivalent and a substitute for castration. And now we are informed that\nin Australia certain primitive tribes practice circumcision as a rite of\npuberty (the ceremony in honor of the boy's coming of age), while\nothers, living quite near, have substituted for this act the striking\nout of a tooth.\nI end my exposition with these examples. They are only examples. We know\nmore about these matters, and you may well imagine how much richer and\nhow much more interesting such a collection would appear if made, not by\namateurs like ourselves, but by real experts in mythology, anthropology,\nphilology and folk-lore. We are compelled to draw a few conclusions\nwhich cannot be exhaustive, but which give us much food for thought.\nIn the first place, we are faced by the fact that the dreamer has at his\ndisposal a symbolic means of expression of which he is unconscious\nwhile awake, and does not recognize when he sees. That is as remarkable\nas if you should make the discovery that your chambermaid understands\nSanskrit, although you know she was born in a Bohemian village and never\nlearned the language. It is not easy to harmonize this fact with our\npsychological views. We can only say that the dreamer's knowledge of\nsymbolism is unconscious, that it is a part of his unconscious mental\nlife. We make no progress with this assumption. Until now it was only\nnecessary to admit of unconscious impulses, those about which one knew\nnothing, either for a period of time or at all times. But now we deal\nwith something more; indeed, with unknown knowledge, with thought\nrelationships, comparisons between unlike objects which lead to this,\nthat one constant may be substituted for another. These comparisons are\nnot made anew each time, but they lie ready, they are complete for all\ntime. That is to be concluded from the fact of their agreement in\ndifferent persons, agreement despite differences in language.\nBut whence comes the knowledge of these symbol-relationships? The usages\nof language cover only a small part of them. The dreamer is for the most\npart unacquainted with the numerous parallels from other sources; we\nourselves must first laboriously gather them together.\nSecondly, these symbolic representations are peculiar neither to the\ndreamer nor to the dream work by means of which they become expressed.\nWe have learned that mythology and fairy-tales make use of the same\nsymbolism, as well as do the people in their sayings and songs, the\nordinary language of every day, and poetic phantasy. The field of\nsymbolism is an extraordinarily large one, and dream symbolism is but a\nsmall part thereof. It is not even expedient to approach the whole\nproblem from the dream side. Many of the symbols that are used in other\nplaces do not occur in the dream at all, or at best only very seldom.\nMany of the dream symbols are to be found in other fields only very\nrarely, as you have seen. One gets the impression that he is here\nconfronted with an ancient but no longer existent method of expression,\nof which various phases, however, continue in different fields, one\nhere, one there, a third, perhaps in a slightly altered form, in several\nfields. I am reminded of the phantasy of an interesting mental\ndefective, who had imagined a fundamental language, of which all these\nsymbolic representations were the remains.\nThirdly, you must have noticed that symbolism in these other fields is\nby no means sex symbolism solely, while in the dream the symbols are\nused almost entirely to express sexual objects and processes. Nor is\nthis easily explained. Is it possible that symbols originally sexual in\ntheir meaning later came to have other uses, and that this was the\nreason perhaps for the weakening of the symbolic representation to one\nof another nature? These questions are admittedly unanswerable if one\nhas dealt only with dream-symbolism. One can only adhere to the\nsupposition that there is an especially intimate connection between true\nsymbols and things sexual.\nAn important indication of this has been given us recently. A\nphilologist, H. Sperber (Upsala) who works independently of\npsychoanalysis, advanced the theory that sexual needs have played the\nlargest part in the origin and development of languages. The first\nsounds served as means of communication, and called the sexual partner;\nthe further development of the roots of speech accompanied the\nperformance of the primitive man's work. This work was communal and\nprogressed to the accompaniment of rhythmically repeated word sounds. In\nthat way a sexual interest was transferred to the work. The primitive\nman made work acceptable at the same time that he used it as an\nequivalent and substitute for sex-activity. The word thus called forth\nby the common labor had two meanings, designating the sex-act as well as\nthe equivalent labor-activity. In time the word became disassociated\nfrom its sexual significance and became fixed on this work. Generations\nlater the same thing happened to a new word that once had sexual\nsignificance and came to be used for a new type of work. In this manner\na number of word-roots were formed, all of sexual origin, and all of\nwhich had lost their sexual significance. If the description sketched\nhere approximates the truth, it opens up the possibility for an\nunderstanding of the dream symbolism. We can understand how it is that\nin the dream, which preserves something of these most ancient\nconditions, there are so extraordinarily many symbols for the sexual,\nand why, in general, weapons and implements always stand for the male,\nmaterials and things manufactured, for the female. Symbolic\nrelationships would be the remnants of the old word-identity; things\nwhich once were called by the same names as the genitals can now appear\nin the dream as symbols for them.\nFrom our parallels to dream symbolization you may also learn to\nappreciate what is the character of psychoanalysis which makes it a\nsubject of general interest, which is true of neither psychology nor\npsychiatry. Psychoanalytic work connects with so many other scientific\nsubjects, the investigation of which promises the most pertinent\ndiscoveries, with mythology, with folk-lore, with racial psychology and\nwith religion. You will understand how a journal can have grown on\npsychoanalytic soil, the sole purpose of which is the furtherance of\nthese relationships. This is the _Imago_ founded in 1912 and edited by\nHanns Sachs and Otto Rank. In all of these relations, psychoanalysis is\nfirst and foremost the giving, less often the receiving, part. Indeed it\nderives benefit from the fact that its unusual teachings are\nsubstantiated by their recurrence in other fields, but on the whole it\nis psychoanalysis that provides the technical procedure and the point of\nview, the use of which will prove fruitful in those other fields. The\npsychic life of the human individual provides us, upon psychoanalytic\ninvestigation, with explanations with which we are able to solve many\nriddles in the life of humanity, or at least show these riddles in their\nproper light.\nFurthermore, I have not even told you under what conditions we are able\nto get the deepest insight into that suppositious \"fundamental\nlanguage,\" or from which field we gain the most information. So long as\nyou do not know this you cannot appreciate the entire significance of\nthe subject. This field is the neurotic, its materials, the symptoms and\nother expressions of the nervous patient, for the explanation and\ntreatment of which psychoanalysis was devised.\nMy fourth point of view returns to our premise and connects up with our\nprescribed course. We said, even if there were no such thing as dream\ncensorship, the dream would still be hard to understand, for we would\nthen be confronted with the task of translating the symbol-language of\nthe dream into the thought of our waking hours. Symbolism is a second\nand independent item of dream distortion, in addition to dream\ncensorship. It is not a far cry to suppose that it is convenient for\nthe dream censorship to make use of symbolism since both lead to the\nsame end, to making the dream strange and incomprehensible.\nWhether or not in the further study of the dream we shall hit upon a new\nitem that influences dream distortion, remains to be seen. I should not\nlike to leave the subject of dream symbolism without once more touching\nupon the curious fact that it arouses such strong opposition in the case\nof educated persons, in spite of the fact that symbolism in myth,\nreligion, art and speech is undoubtedly so prevalent. Is not this again\nbecause of its relationship to sexuality?\nELEVENTH LECTURE\nTHE DREAM\n_The Dream-Work_\nIf you have mastered dream censorship and symbolic representation, you\nare, to be sure, not yet adept in dream distortion, but you are\nnevertheless in a position to understand most dreams. For this you\nemploy two mutually supplementary methods, call up the associations of\nthe dreamer until you have penetrated from the substitute to the actual,\nand from your own knowledge supply the meaning for the symbol. Later we\nshall discuss certain uncertainties which show themselves in this\nprocess.\nWe are now in a position to resume work which we attempted, with very\ninsufficient means at an earlier stage, when we studied the relation\nbetween the manifest dream elements and their latent actualities, and in\nso doing established four such main relationships: that of a part of the\nwhole, that of approach or allusion, the symbolic relationship and\nplastic word representation. We shall now attempt the same on a larger\nscale, by comparing the manifest dream content as a whole, with the\nlatent dream which we found by interpretation.\nI hope you will never again confuse these two. If you have achieved\nthis, you have probably accomplished more in the understanding of the\ndream than the majority of the readers of my _Interpretation of Dreams_.\nLet me remind you once more that this process, which changes the latent\ninto the manifest dream, is called _dream-work_. Work which proceeds in\nthe opposite direction, from the manifest dream to the latent, is our\n_work of interpretation_. The work of interpretation attempts to undo\nthe dream-work. Infantile dreams that are recognized as evident wish\nfulfillments nevertheless have undergone some dream-work, namely, the\ntransformation of the wish into reality, and generally, too, of thoughts\ninto visual pictures. Here we need no interpretation, but only a\nretracing of these transformations. Whatever dream-work has been added\nto other dreams, we call _dream distortion_, and this can be annulled by\nour work of interpretation.\nThe comparison of many dream interpretations has rendered it possible\nfor me to give you a coherent representation of what the dream-work does\nwith the material of the latent dream. I beg of you, however, not to\nexpect to understand too much of this. It is a piece of description that\nshould be listened to with calm attention.\nThe first process of the dream-work is _condensation_. By this we\nunderstand that the manifest dream has a smaller content than the latent\none, that is, it is a sort of abbreviated translation of the latter.\nCondensation may occasionally be absent, but as a rule it is present,\noften to a very high degree. The opposite is never true, that is, it\nnever occurs that the manifest dream is more extensive in scope and\ncontent than the latent. Condensation occurs in the following ways: 1.\nCertain latent elements are entirely omitted; 2. only a fragment of the\nmany complexes of the latent dream is carried over into the manifest\ndream; 3. latent elements that have something in common are collected\nfor the manifest dream and are fused into a whole.\nIf you wish, you may reserve the term \"condensation\" for this last\nprocess alone. Its effects are particularly easy to demonstrate. From\nyour own dreams you will doubtless recall the fusion of several persons\ninto one. Such a compound person probably looks like A., is dressed like\nB., does something that one remembers of C., but in spite of this one is\nconscious that he is really D. By means of this compound formation\nsomething common to all four people is especially emphasized. One can\nmake a compound formation of events and of places in the same way as of\npeople, provided always that the single events and localities have\nsomething in common which the latent dream emphasizes. It is a sort of\nnew and fleeting concept of formation, with the common element as its\nkernel. This jumble of details that has been fused together regularly\nresults in a vague indistinct picture, as though you had taken several\npictures on the same film.\nThe shaping of such compound formations must be of great importance to\nthe dream-work, for we can prove, (by the choice of a verbal expression\nfor a thought, for instance) that the common elements mentioned above\nare purposely manufactured where they originally do not exist. We have\nalready become acquainted with such condensation and compound\nformations; they played an important part in the origin of certain cases\nof slips of the tongue. You recall the young man who wished to _inscort_\na woman. Furthermore, there are jokes whose technique may be traced to\nsuch a condensation. But entirely aside from this, one may maintain that\nthis appearance of something quite unknown in the dream finds its\ncounterpart in many of the creations of our imagination which fuse\ntogether component parts that do not belong together in experience, as\nfor example the centaurs, and the fabulous animals of old mythology or\nof Boecklin's pictures. For creative imagination can invent nothing new\nwhatsoever, it can only put together certain details normally alien to\none another. The peculiar thing, however, about the procedure of the\ndream-work is the following: The material at the disposal of the\ndream-work consists of thoughts, thoughts which may be offensive and\nunacceptable, but which are nevertheless correctly formed and expressed.\nThese thoughts are transformed into something else by the dream-work,\nand it is remarkable and incomprehensible that this translation, this\nrendering, as it were, into another script or language, employs the\nmethods of condensation and combination. For a translation usually\nstrives to respect the discriminations expressed in the text, and to\ndifferentiate similar things. The dream-work, on the contrary, tries to\nfuse two different thoughts by looking, just as the joke does, for an\nambiguous word which shall act as a connecting link between the two\nthoughts. One need not attempt to understand this feature of the case at\nonce, but it may become significant for the conception of the\ndream-work.\nAlthough condensation renders the dream opaque, one does not get the\nimpression that it is an effect of dream censorship. One prefers to\ntrace it back to mechanical or economic conditions; but censorship\nundoubtedly has a share in the process.\nThe results of condensation may be quite extraordinary. With its help,\nit becomes possible at times to collect quite unrelated latent thought\nprocesses into one manifest dream, so that one can arrive at an\napparently adequate interpretation, and at the same time conceive a\npossible further interpretation.\nThe consequence of condensation for the relation between latent and\nmanifest dreams is the fact that no simple relations can exist between\nthe elements of the one and the other. A manifest element corresponds\nsimultaneously to several latent ones, and vice versa, a latent element\nmay partake of several manifest ones, an interlacing, as it were. In the\ninterpretation of the dream it also becomes evident that the\nassociations to a single element do not necessarily follow one another\nin orderly sequence. Often we must wait until the entire dream is\ninterpreted.\nDream-work therefore accomplishes a very unusual sort of transcription\nof dream thoughts, not a translation word for word, or sign for sign,\nnot a selection according to a set rule, as if all the consonants of a\nword were given and the vowels omitted; nor is it what we might call\nsubstitution, namely, the choice of one element to take the place of\nseveral others. It is something very different and much more\ncomplicated.\nThe second process of the dream-work is _displacement_. Fortunately we\nare already prepared for this, since we know that it is entirely the\nwork of dream censorship. The two evidences of this are firstly, that a\nlatent element is not replaced by one of its constituent parts but by\nsomething further removed from it, that is, by a sort of allusion;\nsecondly, that the psychic accent is transferred from an important\nelement to another that is unimportant, so that the dream centers\nelsewhere and seems strange.\nSubstitution by allusion is known to our conscious thinking also, but\nwith a difference. In conscious thinking the allusion must be easily\nintelligible, and the substitute must bear a relation to the actual\ncontent. Jokes, too, often make use of allusion; they let the condition\nof content associations slide and replace it by unusual external\nassociations, such as resemblances in sound, ambiguity of words, etc.\nThey retain, however, the condition of intelligibility; the joke would\nlose all its effect if the allusion could not be traced back to the\nactual without any effort whatsoever. The allusion of displacement has\nfreed itself of both these limitations. Its connection with the element\nwhich it replaces is most external and remote, is unintelligible for\nthis reason, and if it is retraced, its interpretation gives the\nimpression of an unsuccessful joke or of a forced, far-fetched\nexplanation. For the dream censor has only then accomplished its\npurpose, when it has made the path of return from the allusion to the\noriginal undiscoverable.\nThe displacement of emphasis is unheard of as a means of expressing\nthoughts. In conscious thinking we occasionally admit it to gain a comic\neffect. I can probably give you an idea of the confusion which this\nproduces by reminding you of the story of the blacksmith who had\ncommitted a capital crime. The court decided that the penalty for the\ncrime must be paid, but since he was the only blacksmith in the village\nand therefore indispensable, while there were three tailors, one of the\nlatter was hung in his stead.\nThe third process of the dream-work is the most interesting from a\npsychological point of view. It consists of the _translation_ of\nthoughts into visual images. Let us bear in mind that by no means all\ndream thoughts undergo this translation; many of them retain their form\nand appear in the manifest dream also as thought or consciousness;\nmoreover, visual images are not the only form into which thoughts are\ntranslated. They are, however, the foundation of the dream fabric; this\npart of the dream work is, as we already know, the second most constant,\nand for single dream elements we have already learned to know \"plastic\nword representation.\"\nIt is evident that this process is not simple. In order to get an idea\nof its difficulties you must pretend that you have undertaken the task\nof replacing a political editorial in a newspaper by a series of\nillustrations, that you have suffered an atavistic return from the use\nof the alphabet to ideographic writing. Whatever persons or concrete\nevents occur in this article you will be able to replace easily by\npictures, perhaps to your advantage, but you will meet with difficulties\nin the representation of all abstract words and all parts of speech\ndenoting thought relationships, such as particles, conjunctions, etc.\nWith the abstract words you could use all sorts of artifices. You will,\nfor instance, try to change the text of the article into different words\nwhich may sound unusual, but whose components will be more concrete and\nmore adapted to representation. You will then recall that most abstract\nwords were concrete before their meaning paled, and will therefore go\nback to the original concrete significance of these words as often as\npossible, and so you will be glad to learn that you can represent the\n\"possession\" of an object by the actual physical straddling of it.[32]\nThe dream work does the same thing. Under such circumstances you can\nhardly demand accuracy of representation. You will also have to allow\nthe dream-work to replace an element that is as hard to depict as for\ninstance, broken faith, by another kind of rupture, a broken leg.[33] In\nthis way you will be able to smooth away to some extent the crudity of\nimagery when the latter is endeavoring to replace word expression.\nIn the representation of parts of speech that denote thought relations,\nsuch as _because_, _therefore_, _but_, etc., you have no such aids;\nthese constituent parts of the text will therefore be lost in your\ntranslation into images. In the same way, the dream-work resolves the\ncontent of the dream thought into its raw material of objects and\nactivities. You may be satisfied if the possibility is vouchsafed you to\nsuggest certain relations, not representable in themselves, in a more\ndetailed elaboration of the image. In quite the same way the dream-work\nsucceeds in expressing much of the content of the latent dream thought\nin the formal peculiarities of the manifest dream, in its clearness or\nvagueness, in its division into several parts, etc. The number of\nfragmentary dreams into which the dream is divided corresponds as a rule\nto the number of main themes, of thought sequences in the latent dream;\na short preliminary dream often stands as an introduction or a\nmotivation to the complementary dream which follows; a subordinate\nclause in dream thought is represented in the manifest dream as an\ninterpolated change of scene, etc. The form of the dream is itself,\ntherefore, by no means without significance and challenges\ninterpretation. Different dreams of the same night often have the same\nmeaning, and testify to an increasing effort to control a stimulus of\ngrowing urgency. In a single dream a particularly troublesome element\nmay be represented by \"duplicates,\" that is, by numerous symbols.\nBy continually comparing dream thought with the manifest dream that\nreplaces it, we learn all sorts of things for which we were not\nprepared, as for instance, the fact that even the nonsense and absurdity\nof the dream have meaning. Yes, on this point the opposition between the\nmedical and psychoanalytic conception of the dream reaches a climax not\npreviously achieved. According to the former, the dream is senseless\nbecause the dreaming psychic activity has lost all power of critical\njudgment; according to our theory, on the other hand, the dream becomes\nsenseless, whenever a critical judgment, contained in the dream thought,\nwishes to express the opinion: \"It is nonsense.\" The dream which you all\nknow, about the visit to the theatre (three tickets 1 Fl. 50 Kr.) is a\ngood example of this. The opinion expressed here is: \"It was _nonsense_\nto marry so early.\"\nIn the same way, we discover in interpretation what is the significance\nof the doubts and uncertainties so often expressed by the dreamer as to\nwhether a certain element really occurred in the dream; whether it was\nthis or something else. As a rule these doubts and uncertainties\ncorrespond to nothing in the latent dream thought; they are occasioned\nthroughout by the working of the dream censor and are equivalent to an\nunsuccessful attempt at suppression.\nOne of the most surprising discoveries is the manner in which the\ndream-work deals with those things which are opposed to one another in\nthe latent dream. We already know that agreements in the latent material\nare expressed in the manifest dream by condensations. Now oppositions\nare treated in exactly the same way as agreements and are, with special\npreference, expressed by the same manifest element. An element in a\nmanifest dream, capable of having an opposite, may therefore represent\nitself as well as its opposite, or may do both simultaneously; only the\ncontext can determine which translation is to be chosen. It must follow\nfrom this that the particle \"no\" cannot be represented in the dream, at\nleast not unambiguously.\nThe development of languages furnishes us with a welcome analogy for\nthis surprising behavior on the part of the dream work. Many scholars\nwho do research work in languages have maintained that in the oldest\nlanguages opposites--such as strong, weak; light, dark; big,\nlittle--were expressed by the same root word. (_The Contradictory Sense\nof Primitive Words._) In old Egyptian, _ken_ originally meant both\nstrong and weak. In conversation, misunderstanding in the use of such\nambiguous words was avoided by the tone of voice and by accompanying\ngestures, in writing by the addition of so-called determinatives, that\nis, by a picture that was itself not meant to be expressed. Accordingly,\nif ken meant strong, the picture of an erect little man was placed after\nthe alphabetical signs, if _ken_, _weak_, was meant, the picture of a\ncowering man followed. Only later, by slight modifications of the\noriginal word, were two designations developed for the opposites which\nit denoted. In this way, from _ken_ meaning both strong and weak, there\nwas derived a _ken_, strong, and a _ken_, weak. It is said that not only\nthe most primitive languages in their last developmental stage, but also\nthe more recent ones, even the living tongues of to-day have retained\nabundant remains of this primitive opposite meaning. Let me give you a\nfew illustrations of this taken from C. Abel (1884).\nIn Latin there are still such words of double meaning:\n_altus_--high, deep, and _sacer_, sacred, accursed.\nAs examples of modifications of the same root, I cite:\n_clamare_--to scream, _clam_--quiet, still, secret;\n_siccus_--dry, _succus_--juice.\nAnd from the German:\n_Stimme_--voice, _stumm_--dumb.\nThe comparison of related tongues yields a wealth of examples:\nEnglish: _lock_; German: _Loch_--hole, _Luecke_--gap.\nEnglish: _cleave_; German: _kleben_--to stick, to adhere.\nThe English _without_, is to-day used to mean \"not with\"; that \"with\"\nhad the connotation of deprivation as well as that of apportioning, is\napparent from the compounds: _withdraw_, _withhold_. The German\n_wieder_, again, closely resembles this.\nAnother peculiarity of dream-work finds it prototype in the development\nof language. It occurred in ancient Egyptian as well as in other later\nlanguages that the sequence of sounds of the words was transposed to\ndenote the same fundamental idea. The following are examples from\nEnglish and German:\n_Topf_--_pot_; _boat_--_tub_; _hurry_--_Ruhe_ (rest, quiet).\n_Balken_ (beam)--_Kloben_ (mallet)--_club_.\nFrom the Latin and the German:\n_capere_ (to seize)--_packen_ (to seize, to grasp).\nInversions such as occur here in the single word are effected in a very\ndifferent way by the dream-work. We already know the inversion of the\nsense, substitution by the opposite. Besides there are inversions of\nsituations, of relations between two people, and so in dreams we are in\na sort of topsy-turvy world. In a dream it is frequently the rabbit that\nshoots the hunter. Further inversion occurs in the sequence of events,\nso that in the dream the cause is placed after the effect. It is like a\nperformance in a third-rate theatre, where the hero falls before the\nshot which kills him is fired from the wings. Or there are dreams in\nwhich the whole sequence of the elements is inverted, so that in the\ninterpretation one must take the last first, and the first last, in\norder to obtain a meaning. You will recall from our study of dream\nsymbolism that to go or fall into the water means the same as to come\nout of it, namely, to give birth to, or to be born, and that mounting\nstairs or a ladder means the same as going down. The advantage that\ndream distortions may gain from such freedom of representation, is\nunmistakable.\nThese features of the dream-work may be called _archaic_. They are\nconnected with ancient systems of expression, ancient languages and\nliteratures, and involve the same difficulties which we shall deal with\nlater in a critical connection.\nNow for some other aspects of the matter. In the dream-work it is\nplainly a question of translating the latent thoughts, expressed in\nwords, into psychic images, in the main, of a visual kind. Now our\nthoughts were developed from such psychic images; their first material\nand the steps which led up to them were psychic impressions, or to be\nmore exact, the memory images of these psychic impressions. Only later\nwere words attached to these and then combined into thoughts. The\ndream-work therefore puts the thoughts through a _regressive_ treatment,\nthat is, one that retraces the steps in their development. In this\nregression, all that has been added to the thoughts as a new\ncontribution in the course of the development of the memory pictures\nmust fall away.\nThis, then, is the dream-work. In view of the processes that we have\ndiscovered about it, our interest in the manifest dream was forced into\nthe background. I shall, however, devote a few remarks to the latter,\nsince it is after all the only thing that is positively known to us.\nIt is natural that the manifest dream should lose its importance for us.\nIt must be a matter of indifference to us whether it is well composed or\nresolved into a series of disconnected single images. Even when its\nexterior seems to be significant, we know that it has been developed by\nmeans of dream distortion and may have as little organic connection with\nthe inner content of the dream as the facade of an Italian church has\nwith its structure and ground plan. At other times this facade of the\ndream, too, has its significance, in that it reproduces with little or\nno distortion an important part of the latent dream thought. But we\ncannot know this before we have put the dream through a process of\ninterpretation and reached a decision as to what amount of distortion\nhas taken place. A similar doubt prevails when two elements in the dream\nseem to have been brought into close relations to one another. This may\nbe a valuable hint, suggesting that we may join together those manifest\nthoughts which correspond to the elements in the latent dream; yet at\nother times we are convinced that what belongs together in thought has\nbeen torn apart in the dream.\nAs a general rule we must refrain from trying to explain one part of the\nmanifest dream by another, as if the dream were coherently conceived and\npragmatically represented. At the most it is comparable to a Breccian\nstone, produced by the fusion of various minerals in such a way that the\nmarkings it shows are entirely different from those of the original\nmineral constituents. There is actually a part of the dream-work, the\nso-called _secondary treatment_, whose function it is to develop\nsomething unified, something approximately coherent from the final\nproducts of the dream-work. In so doing the material is often arranged\nin an entirely misleading sense and insertions are made wherever it\nseems necessary.\nOn the other hand, we must not over-estimate the dream-work, nor\nattribute too much to it. The processes which we have enumerated tell\nthe full tale of its functioning; beyond condensing, displacing,\nrepresenting plastically, and then subjecting the whole to a secondary\ntreatment, it can do nothing. Whatever of judgment, of criticism, of\nsurprise, and of deduction are to be found in the dream are not products\nof the dream-work and are only very seldom signs of afterthoughts about\nthe dream, but are generally parts of the latent dream thought, which\nhave passed over into the manifest dream, more or less modified and\nadapted to the context. In the matter of composing speeches, the\ndream-work can also do nothing. Except for a few examples, the speeches\nin the dream are imitations and combinations of speeches heard or made\nby oneself during the day, and which have been introduced into the\nlatent thought, either as material or as stimuli for the dream. Neither\ncan the dream pose problems; when these are found in the dream, they are\nin the main combinations of numbers, semblances of examples that are\nquite absurd or merely copies of problems in the latent dream thought.\nUnder these conditions it is not surprising that the interest which has\nattached itself to the dream-work is soon deflected from it to the\nlatent dream thoughts which are revealed in more or less distorted form\nin the manifest dream. It is not justifiable, however, to have this\nchange go so far that in a theoretical consideration one regularly\nsubstitutes the latent dream thought for the dream itself, and\nmaintains of the latter what can hold only for the former. It is odd\nthat the results of psychoanalysis should be misused for such an\nexchange. \"Dream\" can mean nothing but the result of the dream-work,\nthat is, the _form_ into which the latent dream thoughts have been\ntranslated by the dream-work.\nDream-work is a process of a very peculiar sort, the like of which has\nhitherto not been discovered in psychic life. These condensations,\ndisplacements, regressive translations of thoughts into pictures, are\nnew discoveries which richly repay our efforts in the field of\npsychoanalysis. You will realize from the parallel to the dream-work,\nwhat connections psychoanalytic studies will reveal with other fields,\nespecially with the development of speech and thought. You can only\nsurmise the further significance of these connections when you hear that\nthe mechanism of the dream structure is the model for the origin of\nneurotic symptoms.\nI know too that we cannot as yet estimate the entire contribution that\nthis work has made to psychology. We shall only indicate the new proofs\nthat have been given of the existence of unconscious psychic acts--for\nsuch are the latent dream thoughts--and the unexpectedly wide approach\nto the understanding of the unconscious psychic life that dream\ninterpretation opens up to us.\nThe time has probably come, however, to illustrate separately, by\nvarious little examples of dreams, the connected facts for which you\nhave been prepared.\nTWELFTH LECTURE\nTHE DREAM\n_Analysis of Sample Dreams_\nI hope you will not be disappointed if I again lay before you excerpts\nfrom dream analyses instead of inviting you to participate in the\ninterpretation of a beautiful long dream. You will say that after so\nmuch preparation you ought to have this right, and that after the\nsuccessful interpretation of so many thousands of dreams it should long\nago have become possible to assemble a collection of excellent dream\nsamples with which we could demonstrate all our assertions concerning\ndream-work and dream thoughts. Yes, but the difficulties which stand in\nthe way of the fulfillment of your wish are too many.\nFirst of all, I must confess to you that no one practices dream\ninterpretation as his main occupation. When does one interpret dreams?\nOccasionally one can occupy himself with the dream of some friend,\nwithout any special purpose, or else he may work with his own dreams for\na time in order to school himself in psychoanalytic method; most often,\nhowever, one deals with the dreams of nervous individuals who are\nundergoing analytic treatment. These latter dreams are excellent\nmaterial, and in no way inferior to those of normal persons, but one is\nforced by the technique of the treatment to subordinate dream analysis\nto therapeutic aims and to pass over a large number of dreams after\nhaving derived something from them that is of use in the treatment. Many\ndreams we meet with during the treatment are, as a matter of fact,\nimpossible of complete analysis. Since they spring from the total mass\nof psychic material which is still unknown to us, their understanding\nbecomes possible only after the completion of the cure. Besides, to tell\nyou such dreams would necessitate the disclosure of all the secrets\nconcerning a neurosis. That will not do for us, since we have taken the\ndream as preparation for the study of the neuroses.\nI know you would gladly leave this material, and would prefer to hear\nthe dreams of healthy persons, or your own dreams explained. But that is\nimpossible because of the content of these dreams. One can expose\nneither himself, nor another whose confidence he has won, so\ninconsiderately as would result from a thorough interpretation of his\ndreams--which, as you already know, refer to the most intimate things of\nhis personality. In addition to this difficulty, caused by the nature of\nthe material, there is another that must be considered when\ncommunicating a dream. You know the dream seems strange even to the\ndreamer himself, let alone to one who does not know the dreamer. Our\nliterature is not poor in good and detailed dream analyses. I myself\nhave published some in connection with case histories. Perhaps the best\nexample of a dream interpretation is the one published by O. Rank, being\ntwo related dreams of a young girl, covering about two pages of print,\nthe analysis covering seventy-six pages. I would need about a whole\nsemester in order to take you through such a task. If we select a longer\nor more markedly distorted dream, we have to make so many explanations,\nwe must make use of so many free associations and recollections, must go\ninto so many bypaths, that a lecture on the subject would be entirely\nunsatisfactory and inconclusive. So I must ask you to be content with\nwhat is more easily obtained, with the recital of small bits of dreams\nof neurotic persons, in which we may be able to recognize this or that\nisolated fact. Dream symbols are the most easily demonstrable, and after\nthem, certain peculiarities of regressive dream representations.[34] I\nshall tell you why I considered each of the following dreams worthy of\ncommunication.\n1. A dream, consisting of only two brief pictures: \"_The dreamer's uncle\nis smoking a cigarette, although it is Saturday. A woman caresses him as\nthough he were her child._\"\nIn commenting on the first picture, the dreamer (a Jew) remarks that his\nuncle is a pious man who never did, and never would do, anything so\nsinful as smoking on the Sabbath. As to the woman of the second picture,\nhe has no free associations other than his mother. These two pictures or\nthoughts should obviously be brought into connection with each other,\nbut how? Since he expressly rules out the reality of his uncle's action,\nthen it is natural to interpolate an \"if.\" \"_If_ my uncle, that pious\nman, should smoke a cigarette on Saturday, then I could also permit my\nmother's caresses.\" This obviously means that the mother's caresses are\nprohibited, in the same manner as is smoking on Saturday, to a pious\nJew. You will recall, I told you that all relations between the dream\nthoughts disappear in the dream-work, that these relations are broken up\ninto their raw material, and that it is the task of interpretation to\nre-interpolate the omitted connections.\n2. Through my publications on dreams I have become, in certain respects,\nthe public consultant on matters pertaining to dreams, and for many\nyears I have been receiving communications from the most varied sources,\nin which dreams are related to me or presented to me for my judgment. I\nam of course grateful to all those persons who include with the story of\nthe dream, enough material to make an interpretation possible, or who\ngive such an interpretation themselves. It is in this category that the\nfollowing dream belongs, the dream of a Munich physician in the year\n1910. I select it because it goes to show how impossible of\nunderstanding a dream generally is before the dreamer has given us what\ninformation he has about it. I suspect that at bottom you consider the\nideal dream interpretation that in which one simply inserts the meaning\nof the symbols, and would like to lay aside the technique of free\nassociation to the dream elements. I wish to disabuse your minds of this\nharmful error.\n\"On July 13, 1910, toward morning, I dreamed _that I was bicycling down\na street in Tuebingen, when a brown Dachshund tore after me and caught me\nby the heel. A bit further on I get off, seat myself on a step, and\nbegin to beat the beast, which has clenched its teeth tight._ (_I feel\nno discomfort from the biting or the whole scene._) _Two elderly ladies\nare sitting opposite me and watching me with grins on their faces. Then\nI wake up and, as so often happens to me, the whole dream becomes\nperfectly clear to me in this moment of transition to the waking\nstate._\"\nSymbols are of little use in this case. The dreamer, however, informs\nus, \"I lately fell in love with a girl, just from seeing her on the\nstreet, but had no means of becoming acquainted with her. The most\npleasant means might have been the Dachshund, since I am a great lover\nof animals, and also felt that the girl was in sympathy with this\ncharacteristic.\" He also adds that he repeatedly interfered in the\nfights of scuffling dogs with great dexterity and frequently to the\ngreat amazement of the spectators. Thus we learn that the girl, who\npleased him, was always accompanied by this particular dog. This girl,\nhowever, was disregarded in the manifest dream, and there remained only\nthe dog which he associates with her. Perhaps the elderly ladies who\nsimpered at him took the place of the girl. The remainder of what he\ntells us is not enough to explain this point. Riding a bicycle in the\ndream is a direct repetition of the remembered situation. He had never\nmet the girl with the dog except when he was on his bicycle.\n3. When anyone has lost a loved one, he produces dreams of a special\nsort for a long time afterward, dreams in which the knowledge of death\nenters into the most remarkable compromises with the desire to have the\ndeceased alive again. At one time the deceased is dead and yet continues\nto live on because he does not know that he is dead, and would die\ncompletely only if he knew it; at another time he is half dead and half\nalive, and each of these conditions has its particular signs. One cannot\nsimply label these dreams nonsense, for to come to life again is no more\nimpossible in the dream than, for example, it is in the fairy story, in\nwhich it occurs as a very frequent fate. As far as I have been able to\nanalyze such dreams, I have always found them to be capable of a\nsensible solution, but that the pious wish to recall the deceased to\nlife goes about expressing itself by the oddest methods. Let me tell you\nsuch a dream, which seems queer and senseless enough, and analysis of\nwhich will show you many of the points for which you have been prepared\nby our theoretical discussions. The dream is that of a man who had lost\nhis father many years previously.\n\"_Father is dead, but has been exhumed and looks badly. He goes on\nliving, and the dreamer does everything to prevent him from noticing\nthat fact._\" Then the dream goes on to other things, apparently\nirrelevant.\nThe father is dead, that we know. That he was exhumed is not really\ntrue, nor is the truth of the rest of the dream important. But the\ndreamer tells us that when he came back from his father's funeral, one\nof his teeth began to ache. He wanted to treat this tooth according to\nthe Jewish precept, \"If thy tooth offend thee, pluck it out,\" and betook\nhimself to the dentist. But the latter said, \"One does not simply pull a\ntooth out, one must have patience with it. I shall inject something to\nkill the nerve. Come again in three days and then I will take it out.\"\n\"This 'taking it out',\" says the dreamer suddenly, \"is the exhuming.\"\nIs the dreamer right? It does not correspond exactly, only\napproximately, for the tooth is not taken out, but something that has\ndied off is taken out of it. But after our other experiences we are\nprobably safe in believing that the dream work is capable of such\ninaccuracies. It appears that the dreamer condensed, fused into one, his\ndead father and the tooth that was killed but retained. No wonder then,\nthat in the manifest dream something senseless results, for it is\nimpossible for everything that is said of the tooth to fit the father.\nWhat is it that serves as something intermediate between tooth and\nfather and makes this condensation possible?\nThis interpretation must be correct, however, for the dreamer says that\nhe is acquainted with the saying that when one dreams of losing a tooth\nit means that one is going to lose a member of his family.\nWe know that this popular interpretation is incorrect, or at least is\ncorrect only in a scurrilous sense. For that reason it is all the more\nsurprising to find this theme thus touched upon in the background of\nother portions of the dream content.\nWithout any further urging, the dreamer now begins to tell of his\nfather's illness and death as well as of his relations with him. The\nfather was sick a long time, and his care and treatment cost him, the\nson, much money. And yet it was never too much for him, he never grew\nimpatient, never wished it might end soon. He boasts of his true Jewish\npiety toward his father, of rigid adherence to the Jewish precepts. But\nare you not struck by a contradiction in the thoughts of the dream? He\nhad identified tooth with father. As to the tooth he wanted to follow\nthe Jewish precept that carries out its own judgment, \"pull it out if it\ncauses pain and annoyance.\" He had also been anxious to follow the\nprecept of the law with regard to his father, which in this case,\nhowever, tells him to disregard trouble and expense, to take all the\nburdens upon himself and to let no hostile intent arise toward the\nobject which causes the pain. Would not the agreement be far more\ncompelling if he had really developed feelings toward his father similar\nto those about his sick tooth; that is, had he wished that a speedy\ndeath should put an end to that superfluous, painful and expensive\nexistence?\nI do not doubt that this was really his attitude toward his father\nduring the latter's extended illness, and that his boastful assurances\nof filial piety were intended to distract his attention from these\nrecollections. Under such circumstances, the death-wish directed toward\nthe parent generally becomes active, and disguises itself in phrases of\nsympathetic consideration such as, \"It would really be a blessed release\nfor him.\" But note well that we have here overcome an obstacle in the\nlatent dream thoughts themselves. The first part of these thoughts was\nsurely unconscious only temporarily, that is to say, during the\ndream-work, while the inimical feelings toward the father might have\nbeen permanently unconscious, dating perhaps from childhood,\noccasionally slipping into consciousness, shyly and in disguise, during\nhis father's illness. We can assert this with even greater certainty of\nother latent thoughts which have made unmistakable contributions to the\ndream content. To be sure, none of these inimical feelings toward the\nfather can be discovered in the dream. But when we search a childhood\nhistory for the root of such enmity toward the father, we recollect that\nfear of the father arises because the latter, even in the earliest\nyears, opposes the boy's sex activities, just as he is ordinarily forced\nto oppose them again, after puberty, for social motives. This relation\nto the father applies also to our dreamer; there had been mixed with his\nlove for him much respect and fear, having its source in early sex\nintimidation.\nFrom the onanism complex we can now explain the other parts of the\nmanifest dream. \"_He looks badly_\" does, to be sure, allude to another\nremark of the dentist, that it looks badly to have a tooth missing in\nthat place; but at the same time it refers to the \"looking badly\" by\nwhich the young man betrayed, or feared to betray, his excessive sexual\nactivity during puberty. It was not without lightening his own heart\nthat the dreamer transposed the bad looks from himself to his father in\nthe manifest content, an inversion of the dream work with which you are\nfamiliar. \"_He goes on living since then_,\" disguises itself with the\nwish to have him alive again as well as with the promise of the dentist\nthat the tooth will be preserved. A very subtle phrase, however, is the\nfollowing: \"The dreamer does everything _to prevent him_ (_the father_)\n_from noticing the fact_,\" a phrase calculated to lead us to conclude\nthat he is dead. Yet the only meaningful conclusion is again drawn from\nthe onanism complex, where it is a matter of course for the young man to\ndo everything in order to hide his sex life from his father. Remember,\nin conclusion, that we were constantly forced to interpret the so-called\ntooth-ache dreams as dreams dealing with the subject of onanism and the\npunishment that is feared.\nYou now see how this incomprehensible dream came into being, by the\ncreation of a remarkable and misleading condensation, by the fact that\nall the ideas emerge from the midst of the latent thought process, and\nby the creation of ambiguous substitute formations for the most hidden\nand, at the time, most remote of these thoughts.\n4. We have tried repeatedly to understand those prosaic and banal dreams\nwhich have nothing foolish or repulsive about them, but which cause us\nto ask: \"Why do we dream such unimportant stuff?\" So I shall give you a\nnew example of this kind, three dreams belonging together, all of which\nwere dreamed in the same night by a young woman.\n(_a_). \"_She it going through the hall of her house and strikes her head\nagainst the low-hanging chandelier, so that her head bleeds._\"\nShe has no reminiscence to contribute, nothing that really happened. The\ninformation she gives leads in quite another direction. \"You know how\nbadly my hair is falling out. Mother said to me yesterday, 'My child, if\nit goes on like this, you will have a head like the cheek of a\nbuttock.'\" Thus the head here stands for the other part of the body. We\ncan understand the chandelier symbolically without other help; all\nobjects that can be lengthened are symbols of the male organ. Thus the\ndream deals with a bleeding at the lower end of the body, which results\nfrom its collision with the male organ. This might still be ambiguous;\nher further associations show that it has to do with her belief that\nmenstrual bleeding results from sexual intercourse with a man, a bit of\nsexual theory believed by many immature girls.\n(_b_). \"_She sees a deep hole in the vineyard which she knows was made\nby pulling out a tree._\" Herewith her remark that \"_she misses the\ntree_.\" She means that she did not see the tree in the dream, but the\nsame phrase serves to express another thought which symbolic\ninterpretation makes completely certain. The dream deals with another\nbit of the infantile sex theory, namely, with the belief that girls\noriginally had the same genitals as boys and that the later conformation\nresulted from castration (pulling out of a tree).\n(_c_). \"_She is standing in front of the drawer of her writing table,\nwith which she is so familiar that she knows immediately if anybody has\nbeen through it._\" The writing-table drawer, like every drawer, chest,\nor box, stands for the female genital. She knows that one can recognize\nfrom the genital the signs of sexual intercourse (and, as she thinks,\neven of any contact at all) and she has long been afraid of such a\nconviction. I believe that the accent in all these dreams is to be laid\nupon the idea of _knowing_. She is reminded of the time of her childish\nsexual investigations, the results of which made her quite proud at the\ntime.\n5. Again a little bit of symbolism. But this time I must first describe\nthe psychic situation in a short preface. A man who spent the night with\na woman describes his partner as one of those motherly natures whose\ndesire for a child irresistibly breaks through during intercourse. The\ncircumstances of their meeting, however, necessitated a precaution\nwhereby the fertilizing discharge of semen is kept away from the womb.\nUpon awaking after this night, the woman tells the following dream:\n\"_An officer with a red cap follows her on the street. She flees from\nhim, runs up the staircase, and he follows after her. Breathlessly she\nreaches her apartment and slams and locks the door behind her. He\nremains outside and as she looks through a peephole she sees him sitting\noutside on a bench and weeping._\"\nYou undoubtedly recognize in the pursuit by an officer with a red cap,\nand the breathless stair climbing, the representation of the sexual act.\nThe fact that the dreamer locks herself in against the pursuer may serve\nas an example of that inversion which is so frequently used in dreams,\nfor in reality it was the man who withdrew before the completion of the\nact. In the same way her grief has been transposed to the partner, it is\nhe who weeps in the dream, whereby the discharge of the semen is also\nindicated.\nYou must surely have heard that in psychoanalysis it is always\nmaintained that all dreams have a sexual meaning. Now you yourselves are\nin a position to form a judgment as to the incorrectness of this\nreproach. You have become acquainted with the wish-fulfillment dreams,\nwhich deal with the satisfying of the plainest needs, of hunger, of\nthirst, of longing for freedom, the dreams of convenience and of\nimpatience and likewise the purely covetous and egoistic dreams. But\nthat the markedly distorted dreams preponderantly--though again not\nexclusively--give expression to sex wishes, is a fact you may certainly\nkeep in mind as one of the results of psychoanalytical research.\n6. I have a special motive for piling up examples of the use of symbols\nin dreams. At our first meeting I complained of how hard it is, when\nlecturing on psychoanalysis, to demonstrate the facts in order to awaken\nconviction; and you very probably have come to agree with me since then.\nBut the various assertions of psychoanalysis are so closely linked that\none's conviction can easily extend from one point to a larger part of\nthe whole. We might say of psychoanalysis that if we give it our little\nfinger it promptly demands the whole hand. Anyone who was convinced by\nthe explanation of errors can no longer logically disbelieve in all the\nrest of psychoanalysis. A second equally accessible point of approach is\nfurnished by dream symbolism. I shall give you a dream, already\npublished, of a peasant woman, whose husband is a watchman and who has\ncertainly never heard anything about dream symbolism and psychoanalysis.\nYou may then judge for yourselves whether its explanation with the help\nof sex symbols can be called arbitrary and forced.\n\"_Then someone broke into her house and she called in fright for a\nwatchman. But the latter had gone companionably into a church together\nwith two 'beauties.' A number of steps led up to the church. Behind the\nchurch was a hill, and on its crest a thick forest. The watchman was\nfitted out with a helmet, gorget and a cloak. He had a full brown beard.\nThe two were going along peacefully with the watchman, had sack-like\naprons bound around their hips. There was a path from the church to the\nhill. This was overgrown on both sides with grass and underbrush that\nkept getting thicker and that became a regular forest on the crest of\nthe hill._\"\nYou will recognize the symbols without any difficulty. The male genital\nis represented by a trinity of persons, the female by a landscape with a\nchapel, hill and forest. Again you encounter steps as the symbol of the\nsexual act. That which is called a hill in the dream has the same name\nin anatomy, namely, _mons veneris_, the mount of Venus.\n7. I have another dream which can be solved by means of inserting\nsymbols, a dream that is remarkable and convincing because the dreamer\nhimself translated all the symbols, even though he had had no\npreliminary knowledge of dream interpretation. This situation is very\nunusual and the conditions essential to its occurrence are not clearly\nknown.\n\"_He is going for a walk with his father in some place which must be the\nPrater_,[35] _for one can see the rotunda and before it a smaller\nbuilding to which is anchored a captive balloon, which, however, seems\nfairly slack. His father asks him what all that is for; he wonders at it\nhimself but explains it to his father. Then they come to a courtyard in\nwhich there lies spread out a big sheet of metal. His father wants to\nbreak off a big piece of it for himself but first looks about him to see\nif anyone might see him. He says to him that all he needs to do is to\ntell the inspector and then he can take some without more ado. There are\nsteps leading from this courtyard down into a pit, the walls of which\nare upholstered with some soft material rather like a leather arm chair.\nAt the end of this pit is a longish platform and then a new pit\nbegins...._\"\nThe dreamer himself interprets as follows: \"The rotunda is my genital,\nthe balloon in front of it is my penis, of whose slackness I have been\ncomplaining.\" Thus one may translate in more detail, that the rotunda is\nthe posterior--a part of the body which the child regularly considers as\npart of the genital--while the smaller building before it is the\nscrotum. In the dream his father asks him what all that is for; that is\nto say, he asks the object and function of the genitals. It is easy to\nturn this situation around so that the dreamer is the one who does the\nasking. Since no such questioning of the father ever took place in real\nlife, we must think of the thought of this dream as a wish or consider\nit in the light of a supposition, \"If I had asked father for sexual\nenlightenment.\" We will find the continuation of this idea in another\nplace shortly.\nThe courtyard, in which the sheet metal lies spread out, is not to be\nconsidered primarily as symbolical but refers to the father's place of\nbusiness. For reasons of discretion I have substituted the \"sheet metal\"\nfor another material with which the father deals, without changing\nanything in the literal wording of the dream. The dreamer entered his\nfather's business and took great offense at the rather dubious practices\nupon which the profits depended to a large extent. For this reason the\ncontinuation of the above idea of the dream might be expressed as \"if I\nhad asked him, he would only have deceived me as he deceives his\ncustomers.\" The dreamer himself gives us the second meaning of \"breaking\noff the metal,\" which serves to represent the commercial dishonesty. He\nsays it means masturbation. Not only have we long since become familiar\nwith this symbol, but the fact also is in agreement. The secrecy of\nmasturbation is expressed by means of its opposite--\"It can be safely\ndone openly.\" Again our expectations are fulfilled by the fact that\nmasturbatory activity is referred to as the father's, just as the\nquestioning was in the first scene of the dream. Upon being questioned\nhe immediately gives the interpretation of the pit as the vagina on\naccount of the soft upholstering of its walls. I will add arbitrarily\nthat the \"going down\" like the more usual \"going up\" is meant to\ndescribe the sexual intercourse in the vagina.\nSuch details as the fact that the first pit ends in a platform and then\na new one begins, he explains himself as having been taken from his own\nhistory. He practiced intercourse for a while, then gave it up on\naccount of inhibitions, and now hopes to be able to resume it as a\nresult of the treatment.\n8. The two following dreams are those of a foreigner, of very polygamous\ntendencies, and I give them to you as proof for the claim that one's ego\nappears in every dream, even in those in which it is disguised in the\nmanifest content. The trunks in the dream are a symbol for woman.\n(_a_). \"_He is to take a trip, his luggage is placed on a carriage to\nbe taken to the station, and there are many trunks piled up, among which\nare two big black ones like sample trunks. He says, consolingly, to\nsomeone, 'Well, they are only going as far as the station with us.'_\"\nIn reality he does travel with a great deal of luggage, but he also\nbrings many tales of women with him when he comes for treatment. The two\nblack trunks stand for two dark women who play the chief part in his\nlife at present. One of them wanted to travel to Vienna after him, but\nhe telegraphed her not to, upon my advice.\n(_b_). A scene at the customs house: \"_A fellow traveler opens his trunk\nand says indifferently while puffing a cigarette, 'There's nothing in\nhere.' The customs official seems to believe him but delves into the\ntrunk once more and finds something particularly forbidden. The traveler\nthen says resignedly, 'Well, there's no help for it.'_\"\nHe himself is the traveler, I the customs official. Though otherwise\nvery frank in his confessions, he has on this occasion tried to conceal\nfrom me a new relationship which he had struck up with a lady whom he\nwas justified in believing that I knew. The painful situation of being\nconvicted of this is transposed into a strange person so that he himself\napparently is not present in the dream.\n9. The following is an example of a symbol which I have not yet\nmentioned:\n\"_He meets his sister in company with two friends who are themselves\nsisters. He extends his hand to both of them but not to his sister._\"\nThis is no allusion to a real occurrence. His thoughts instead lead him\nback to a time when his observations made him wonder why a girl's\nbreasts develop so late. The two sisters, therefore, are the breasts. He\nwould have liked to touch them if only it had not been his sister.\n10. Let me add an example of a symbol of death in a dream:\n\"_He is walking with two persons whose name he knows but has forgotten.\nBy the time he is awake, over a very high, steep iron bridge. Suddenly\nthe two people are gone and he sees a ghostly man with a cap, and clad\nin white. He asks this man whether he is the telegraph messenger.... No.\nOr is he a coachman? No. Then he goes on,_\" and even in the dream he is\nin great fear. After waking he continues the dream by a phantasy in\nwhich the iron bridge suddenly breaks, and he plunges into the abyss.\nWhen the dreamer emphasizes the fact that certain individuals in a dream\nare unknown, that he has forgotten their names, they are generally\npersons standing in very close relationship to the dreamer. This dreamer\nhas two sisters; if it be true, as his dream indicates, that he wished\nthese two dead, then it would only be justice if the fear of death fell\nupon him for so doing. In connection with the telegraph messenger he\nremarks that such people always bring bad news. Judged by his uniform he\nmight also have been the lamp-lighter, who, however, also extinguishes\nthe lamps--in other words, as the spirit of death extinguishes the flame\nof life. The coachman reminds him of Uhland's poem of King Karl's ocean\nvoyage and also of a dangerous lake trip with two companions in which he\nplayed the role of the king in the poem. In connection with the iron\nbridge he remembers a recent accident and the stupid saying \"Life is a\nsuspension bridge.\"\n11. The following may serve as another example of the representation of\ndeath in a dream: \"_An unknown man leaves a black bordered visiting card\nfor him._\"\n12. The following dream will interest you for several reasons, though it\nis one arising from a neurotic condition among other things:\n\"_He is traveling in a train. The train stops in an open field. He\nthinks it means that there is going to be an accident, that he must save\nhimself, and he goes through all the compartments of the train and\nstrikes dead everyone whom he meets, conductors, engine drivers, etc._\"\nIn connection with this he tells a story that one of his friends told\nhim. An insane man was being transported in a private compartment in a\ncertain place in Italy, but through some mistake another traveler was\nput in the same compartment. The insane man murdered his fellow\npassenger. Thus he identifies himself with this insane person and bases\nhis right so to do upon a compulsive idea which was then torturing him,\nnamely, he must \"do away with all persons who knew of his failings.\" But\nthen he himself finds a better motivation which gave rise to the dream.\nThe day before, in the theatre, he again saw the girl whom he had\nexpected to marry but whom he had left because she had given him cause\nfor jealousy. With a capacity for intense jealousy such as he has, he\nwould really be insane if he married. In other words, he considers her\nso untrustworthy that out of jealousy he would have to strike dead all\nthe persons who stood in his way. Going through a series of rooms, of\ncompartments in this case, we have already learned to recognize as the\nsymbol of marriage (the opposite of monogamy).\nIn connection with the train stopping in the open country and his fear\nof an accident, he tells the following: Once, when he was traveling in a\ntrain and it came to a sudden stop outside of a station, a young lady in\nthe compartment remarked that perhaps there was going to be a collision,\nand that in that case the best precaution would be to pull one's legs\nup. But this \"legs up\" had also played a role in the many walks and\nexcursions into the open which he had taken with the girl in that happy\nperiod in their first love. Thus it is a new argument for the idea that\nhe would have to be crazy in order to marry her now. But from my\nknowledge of the situation I can assume with certainty that the wish to\nbe as crazy as that nevertheless exists in him.\nTHIRTEENTH LECTURE\nTHE DREAM\n_Archaic Remnants and Infantilism in the Dream_\nLet us revert to our conclusion that the dream-work, under the influence\nof the dream censorship, transforms the latent dream thoughts into some\nother form of expression. The latent thoughts are no other than the\nconscious thoughts known to us in our waking hours; the new mode of\nexpression is incomprehensible to us because of its many-sided features.\nWe have said it extends back to conditions of our intellectual\ndevelopment which we have long progressed beyond, to the language of\npictures, the symbol-representations, perhaps to those conditions which\nwere in force before the development of our language of thought. So we\ncalled the mode of expression of the dream-work the archaic or\nregressive.\nYou may conclude that as a result of the deeper study of the dream-work\nwe gain valuable information about the rather unknown beginnings of our\nintellectual development. I trust this will be true, but this work has\nnot, up to the present time, been undertaken. The antiquity into which\nthe dream-work carries us back is of a double aspect, firstly, the\nindividual antiquity, childhood; and, secondly (in so far as every\nindividual in his childhood lives over again in some more or less\nabbreviated manner the entire development of the human race), also this\nantiquity, the philogenetic. That we shall be able to differentiate\nwhich part of the latent psychic proceeding has its source in the\nindividual, and which part in the philogenetic antiquity is not\nimprobable. In this connection it appears to me, for example, that the\nsymbolic relations which the individual has never learned are ground for\nthe belief that they should be regarded as a philogenetic inheritance.\nHowever, this is not the only archaic characteristic of the dream. You\nprobably all know from your own experiences the peculiar amnesia, that\nis, loss of memory, concerning childhood. I mean the fact that the first\nyears, to the fifth, sixth or eighth, have not left the same traces in\nour memory as have later experiences. One meets with individual persons,\nto be sure, who can boast of a continuous memory from the very beginning\nto the present day, but the other condition, that of a gap in the\nmemory, is far more frequent. I believe we have not laid enough stress\non this fact. The child is able to speak well at the age of two, it soon\nshows that it can become adjusted to the most complicated psychic\nsituations, and makes remarks which years later are retold to it, but\nwhich it has itself entirely forgotten. Besides, the memory in the early\nyears is more facile, because it is less burdened than in later years.\nNor is there any reason for considering the memory-function as a\nparticularly high or difficult psychic performance; in fact, the\ncontrary is true, and you can find a good memory in persons who stand\nvery low intellectually.\nAs a second peculiarity closely related to the first, I must point out\nthat certain well-preserved memories, for the most part formatively\nexperienced, stand forth in this memory-void which surrounds the first\nyears of childhood and do not justify this hypothesis. Our memory deals\nselectively with its later materials, with impressions which come to us\nin later life. It retains the important and discards the unimportant.\nThis is not true of the retained childhood memories. They do not bespeak\nnecessarily important experiences of childhood, not even such as from\nthe viewpoint of the child need appear of importance. They are often so\nbanal and intrinsically so meaningless that we ask ourselves in wonder\nwhy just these details have escaped being forgotten. I once endeavored\nto approach the riddle of childhood amnesia and the interrupted memory\nremnants with the help of analysis, and I arrived at the conclusion that\nin the case of the child, too, only the important has remained in the\nmemory, except that by means of the process of condensation already\nknown to you, and especially by means of distortion, the important is\nrepresented in the memory by something that appears unimportant. For\nthis reason I have called these childhood memories \"disguise-memories,\"\nmemories used to conceal; by means of careful analysis one is able to\ndevelop out of them everything that is forgotten.\nIn psychoanalytic treatment we are regularly called upon to fill out the\ninfantile memory gaps, and in so far as the cure is to any degree\nsuccessful, we are able again to bring to light the content of the\nchildhood years thus clouded in forgetfulness. These impressions have\nnever really been forgotten, they have only been inaccessible, latent,\nhave belonged to the unconscious. But sometimes they bob up out of the\nunconscious spontaneously, and, as a matter of fact, this is what\nhappens in dreams. It is apparent that the dream life knows how to find\nthe entrance to these latent, infantile experiences. Beautiful examples\nof this occur in literature, and I myself can present such an example. I\nonce dreamed in a certain connection of a person who must have performed\nsome service for me, and whom I clearly saw. He was a one-eyed man,\nshort in stature, stout, his head deeply sunk into his neck. I concluded\nfrom the content that he was a physician. Luckily I was able to ask my\nmother, who was still living, how the physician in my birth-place, which\nI left when I was three years old, looked, and I learned from her that\nhe had one eye, was short and stout, with his head sunk into his neck,\nand also learned at what forgotten mishap he had been of service to me.\nThis control over the forgotten material of childhood years is, then, a\nfurther archaic tendency of the dream.\nThe same information may be made use of in another of the puzzles that\nhave presented themselves to us. You will recall how astonished people\nwere when we came to the conclusion that the stimuli which gave rise to\ndreams were extremely bad and licentious sexual desires which have made\ndream-censorship and dream-distortion necessary. After we have\ninterpreted such a dream for the dreamer and he, in the most favorable\ncircumstances does not attack the interpretation itself, he almost\nalways asks the question whence such a wish comes, since it seems\nforeign to him and he feels conscious of just the opposite sensations.\nWe need not hesitate to point out this origin. These evil wish-impulses\nhave their origin in the past, often in a past which is not too far\naway. It can be shown that at one time they were known and conscious,\neven if they no longer are so. The woman, whose dream is interpreted to\nmean that she would like to see her seventeen-year old daughter dead,\ndiscovers under our guidance that she in fact at one time entertained\nthis wish. The child is the fruit of an unhappy marriage, which early\nended in a separation. Once, while the child was still in the womb, and\nafter a tense scene with her husband, she beat her body with her fists\nin a fit of anger, in order to kill the child. How many mothers who\nto-day love their children tenderly, perhaps too tenderly, received them\nunwillingly, and at the time wished that the life within them would not\ndevelop further; indeed, translated this wish into various actions,\nhappily harmless. The later death-wish against some loved one, which\nseems so strange, also has its origin in early phases of the\nrelationship to that person.\nThe father, the interpretation of whose dream shows that he wishes for\nthe death of his eldest and favorite child, must be reminded of the fact\nthat at one time this wish was no stranger to him. While the child was\nstill a suckling, this man, who was unhappy in his choice of a wife,\noften thought that if the little being that meant nothing to him would\ndie, he would again be free, and would make better use of his freedom. A\nlike origin may be found for a large number of similar hate impulses;\nthey are recollections of something that belonged to the past, were once\nconscious and played their parts in the psychic life. You will wish to\nconclude therefrom that such wishes and such dreams cannot occur if such\nchanges in the relationship to a person have not taken place; if such\nrelationship was always of the same character. I am ready to admit this,\nonly wish to warn you that you are to take into consideration not the\nexact terms of the dream, but the meaning thereof according to its\ninterpretation. It may happen that the manifest dream of the death of\nsome loved person has only made use of some frightful mask, that it\nreally means something entirely different, or that the loved person\nserves as a concealing substitute for some other.\nBut the same circumstances will call forth another, more difficult\nquestion. You say: \"Granted this death wish was present at some time or\nother, and is substantiated by memory, yet this is no explanation. It is\nlong outlived, to-day it can be present only in the unconscious and as\nan empty, emotionless memory, but not as a strong impulse. Why should it\nbe recalled by the dream at all!\" This question is justified. The\nattempt to answer it would lead us far afield and necessitate taking up\na position in one of the most important points of dream study. But I\nmust remain within the bounds of our discussion and practice restraint.\nPrepare yourselves for the temporary abstention. Let us be satisfied\nwith the circumstantial proof that this outlived wish can be shown to\nact as a dream stimulator and let us continue the investigation to see\nwhether or not other evil wishes admit of the same derivation out of the\npast.\nLet us continue with the removal or death-wish which most frequently can\nbe traced back to the unbounded egoism of the dreamer. Such a wish can\nvery often be shown to be the inciting cause of the dream. As often as\nsomeone has been in our way in life--and how often must this happen in\nthe complicated relationships of life--the dream is ready to do away\nwith him, be he father, mother, brother, sister, spouse, etc. We have\nwondered sufficiently over this evil tendency of human nature, and\ncertainly were not predisposed to accept the authenticity of this result\nof dream interpretation without question. After it has once been\nsuggested to us to seek the origin of such wishes in the past, we\ndisclose immediately the period of the individual past in which such\negoism and such wish-impulses, even as directed against those closest to\nthe dreamer, are no longer strangers. It is just in these first years of\nchildhood which later are hidden by amnesia, that this egoism frequently\nshows itself in most extreme form, and from which regular but clear\ntendencies thereto, or real remnants thereof, show themselves. For the\nchild loves itself first, and later learns to love others, to sacrifice\nsomething of its ego for another. Even those persons whom the child\nseems to love from the very beginning, it loves at the outset because it\nhas need of them, cannot do without them, in others words, out of\negoistical motives. Not until later does the love impulse become\nindependent of egoism. _In brief, egoism has taught the child to love._\nIn this connection it is instructive to compare the child's regard for\nhis brothers and sisters with that which he has for his parents. The\nlittle child does not necessarily love his brothers and sisters, often,\nobviously, he does not love them at all. There is no doubt that in them\nhe hates his rivals and it is known how frequently this attitude\ncontinues for many years until maturity, and even beyond, without\ninterruption. Often enough this attitude is superseded by a more tender\nfeeling, or rather let us say glossed over, but the hostile feeling\nappears regularly to have been the earlier. It is most noticeable in\nchildren of from two and one-half to four or five years of age, when a\nnew little brother or sister arrives. The latter is usually received in\na far from friendly manner. Expressions such as \"I don't want him! Let\nthe stork take him away again,\" are very usual. Subsequently every\nopportunity is made use of to disparage the new arrival, and even\nattempts to do him bodily harm, direct attacks, are not unheard of. If\nthe difference in age is less, the child learns of the existence of the\nrival with intense psychic activity, and accommodates himself to the new\nsituation. If the difference in age is greater, the new child may awaken\ncertain sympathies as an interesting object, as a sort of living doll,\nand if the difference is eight years or more, motherly impulses,\nespecially in the case of girls, may come into play. But to be truthful,\nwhen we disclose in a dream the wish for the death of a mother or sister\nwe need seldom find it puzzling and may trace its origin easily to early\nchildhood, often enough, also, to the propinquity of later years.\nProbably no nurseries are free from mighty conflicts among the\ninhabitants. The motives are rivalry for the love of the parents,\narticles owned in common, the room itself. The hostile impulses are\ncalled forth by older as well as younger brothers and sisters. I believe\nit was Bernard Shaw who said: \"If there is anyone who hates a young\nEnglish lady more than does her mother, it is her elder sister.\" There\nis something about this saying, however, that arouses our antipathy. We\ncan, at a pinch, understand hatred of brothers and sisters, and rivalry\namong them, but how may feelings of hatred force their way into the\nrelationship between daughter and mother, parents and children?\nThis relationship is without doubt the more favorable, even when looked\nat from the viewpoint of the child. This is in accord with our\nexpectation; we find it much more offensive for love between parents and\nchildren to be lacking than for love between brothers and sisters. We\nhave, so to speak, made something holy in the first instance which in\nthe other case we permitted to remain profane. But daily observation can\nshow us how frequently the feelings between parents and their grown\nchildren fail to come up to the ideal established by society, how much\nenmity exists and would find expression did not accumulations of piety\nand of tender impulse hold them back. The motives for this are\neverywhere known and disclose a tendency to separate those of the same\nsex, daughter from mother, father from son. The daughter finds in her\nmother the authority that hems in her will and that is entrusted with\nthe task of causing her to carry out the abstention from sexual liberty\nwhich society demands; in certain cases also she is the rival who\nobjects to being displaced. The same type of thing occurs in a more\nglaring manner between father and son. To the son the father is the\nembodiment of every social restriction, borne with such great\nopposition; the father bars the way to freedom of will, to early sexual\nsatisfaction, and where there is family property held in common, to the\nenjoyment thereof. Impatient waiting for the death of the father grows\nto heights approximating tragedy in the case of a successor to the\nthrone. Less strained is the relationship between father and daughter,\nmother and son. The latter affords the purest examples of an unalterable\ntenderness, in no way disturbed by egoistical considerations.\nWhy do I speak of these things, so banal and so well known? Because\nthere is an unmistakable disposition to deny their significance in life,\nand to set forth the ideal demanded by society as a fulfilled thing much\noftener than it really is fulfilled. But it is preferable for psychology\nto speak the truth, rather than that this task should be left to the\ncynic. In any event, this denial refers only to actual life. The arts of\nnarrative and dramatic poetry are still free to make use of the motives\nthat result from a disturbance of this ideal.\nIt is not to be wondered at that in the case of a large number of people\nthe dream discloses the wish for the removal of the parents, especially\nthe parent of the same sex. We may conclude that it is also present\nduring waking hours, and that it becomes conscious even at times when it\nis able to mask itself behind another motive, as in the case of the\ndreamer's sympathy for his father's unnecessary sufferings in example 3.\nIt is seldom that the enmity alone controls the relationship; much more\noften it recedes behind more tender impulses, by which it is suppressed,\nand must wait until a dream isolates it. That which the dream shows us\nin enlarged form as a result of such isolation, shrinks together again\nafter it has been properly docketed in its relation to life as a result\nof our interpretation (H. Sachs). But we also find this dream wish in\nplaces where it has no connection with life, and where the adult, in his\nwaking hours, would never recognize it. The reason for this is that the\ndeepest and most uniform motive for becoming unfriendly, especially\nbetween persons of the same sex, has already made its influence felt in\nearliest childhood.\nI mean the love rivalry, with the especial emphasis of the sex\ncharacter. The son, even as a small child, begins to develop an especial\ntenderness for his mother, whom he considers as his own property, and\nfeels his father to be a rival who puts into question his individual\npossession; and in the same manner the little daughter sees in her\nmother a person who is a disturbing element in her tender relationship\nwith her father, and who occupies a position that she could very well\nfill herself. One learns from these observations to what early years\nthese ideas extend back--ideas which we designate as the\n_Oedipus-complex_, because this myth realizes with a very slightly\nweakened effect the two extreme wishes which grow out of the situation\nof the son--to kill his father and take his mother to wife. I do not\nwish to maintain that the Oedipus-complex covers entirely the relation\nof the child to its parents; this relation can be much more complicated.\nFurthermore, the Oedipus-complex is more or less well-developed; it may\neven experience a reversal, but it is a customary and very important\nfactor in the psychic life of the child; and one tends rather to\nunderestimate than to overestimate its influence and the developments\nwhich may follow from it. In addition, children frequently react to the\nOedipus-idea through stimulation by the parents, who in the placing of\ntheir affection are often led by sex-differences, so that the father\nprefers the daughter, the mother the son; or again, where the marital\naffection has cooled, and this love is substituted for the outworn love.\nOne cannot maintain that the world was very grateful to psychoanalytic\nresearch for its discovery of the Oedipus-complex. On the contrary, it\ncalled forth the strongest resistance on the part of adults; and persons\nwho had neglected to take part in denying this proscribed or tabooed\nfeeling-relationship later made good the omission by taking all value\nfrom the complex through false interpretations. According to my\nunchanged conviction there is nothing to deny and nothing to make more\npalatable. One should accept the fact, recognized by the Greek myth\nitself, as inevitable destiny. On the other hand, it is interesting that\nthis Oedipus-complex, cast out of life, was yielded up to poetry and\ngiven the freest play. O. Rank has shown in a careful study how this\nvery Oedipus-complex has supplied dramatic literature with a large\nnumber of motives in unending variations, derivations and disguises,\nalso in distorted forms such as we recognize to be the work of a censor.\nWe may also ascribe this Oedipus-complex to those dreamers who were so\nfortunate as to escape in later life these conflicts with their parents,\nand intimately associated therewith we find what we call the _castration\ncomplex_, the reaction to sexual intimidation or restriction, ascribed\nto the father, of early infantile sexuality.\nBy applying our former researches to the study of the psychic life of\nthe child, we may expect to find that the origin of other forbidden\ndream-wishes, of excessive sexual impulses, may be explained in the same\nmanner. Thus we are moved to study the development of sex-life in the\nchild also, and we discover the following from a number of sources: In\nthe first place, it is a mistake to deny that the child has a sexual\nlife, and to take it for granted that sexuality commences with the\nripening of the genitals at the time of puberty. On the contrary--the\nchild has from the very beginning a sexual life rich in content and\ndiffering in numerous respects from that which is later considered\nnormal. What we call \"perverse\" in the life of the adult, differs from\nthe normal in the following respects: first, in disregard for the\ndividing line of species (the gulf between man and animal); second,\nbeing insensible to the conventional feeling of disgust; third, the\nincest-limitation (being prohibited from seeking sexual satisfaction\nwith near blood-relations); fourth, homosexuality, and fifth,\ntransferring the role of the genitals to other organs and other parts of\nthe body. None of these limitations exist in the beginning, but are\ngradually built up in the course of development and education. The\nlittle child is free from them. He knows no unbridgable chasm between\nman and animal; the arrogance with which man distinguishes himself from\nthe animal is a later acquisition. In the beginning he is not disgusted\nat the sight of excrement, but slowly learns to be so disgusted under\nthe pressure of education; he lays no special stress on the difference\nbetween the sexes, rather accredits to both the same genital formation;\nhe directs his earliest sexual desires and his curiosity toward those\npersons closest to him, and who are dear to him for various reasons--his\nparents, brothers and sisters, nurses; and finally, you may observe in\nhim that which later breaks through again, raised now to a love\nattraction, viz., that he does not expect pleasure from his sexual\norgans alone, but that many other parts of the body portray the same\nsensitiveness, are the media of analogous sensations, and are able to\nplay the role of the genitals. The child may, then, be called\n\"polymorphus perverse,\" and if he makes but slight use of all these\nimpulses, it is, on the one hand, because of their lesser intensity as\ncompared to later life, and on the other hand, because the bringing up\nof the child immediately and energetically suppresses all his sexual\nexpressions. This suppression continues in theory, so to say, since the\ngrown-ups are careful to control part of the childish sex-expressions,\nand to disguise another part by misrepresenting its sexual nature until\nthey can deny the whole business. These are often the same persons who\ndiscourse violently against all the sexual faults of the child and then\nat the writing table defend the sexual purity of the same children.\nWhere children are left to themselves or are under the influence of\ncorruption, they often are capable of really conspicuous performances of\nperverse sexual activity. To be sure, the grown-ups are right in looking\nupon these things as \"childish performances,\" as \"play,\" for the child\nis not to be judged as mature and answerable either before the bar of\ncustom or before the law, but these things do exist, they have their\nsignificance as indications of innate characteristics as well as causes\nand furtherances of later developments, they give us an insight into\nchildhood sex-life and thereby into the sex life of man. When we\nrediscover in the background of our distorted dreams all these perverse\nwish-impulses, it means only that the dream has in this field traveled\nback to the infantile condition.\nEspecially noteworthy among these forbidden wishes are those of incest,\ni.e., those directed towards sexual intercourse with parents and\nbrothers and sisters. You know what antipathy society feels toward such\nintercourse, or at least pretends to feel, and what weight is laid on\nthe prohibitions directed against it. The most monstrous efforts have\nbeen made to explain this fear of incest. Some have believed that it is\ndue to evolutionary foresight on the part of nature, which is\npsychically represented by this prohibition, because inbreeding would\ndeteriorate the race-character; others maintained that because of having\nlived together since early childhood the sexual desire is diverted from\nthe persons under consideration. In both cases, furthermore, the\nincest-avoidance would be automatically assured, and it would be\ndifficult to understand the need of strict prohibitions, which rather\npoint to the presence of a strong desire. Psychoanalytic research has\nincontrovertibly shown that the incestuous love choice is rather the\nfirst and most customary choice, and that not until later is there any\nresistance, the source of which probably is to be found in the\nindividual psychology.\nLet us sum up what our plunge into child psychology has given us toward\nthe understanding of the dream. We found not only that the materials of\nforgotten childhood experiences are accessible to the dream, but we saw\nalso that the psychic life of children, with all its peculiarities, its\negoism, its incestuous love-choice, etc., continues, for the purposes of\nthe dream, in the unconscious, and that the dream nightly leads us back\nto this infantile stage. Thus it becomes more certain _that the\nunconscious in our psychic life is the infantile_. The estranging\nimpression that there is so much evil in man, begins to weaken. This\nfrightful evil is simply the original, primitive, infantile side of\npsychic life, which we may find in action in children, which we overlook\npartly because of the slightness of its dimensions, partly because it is\nlightly considered, since we demand no ethical heights of the child.\nSince the dream regresses to this stage, it seems to have made apparent\nthe evil that lies in us. But it is only a deceptive appearance by which\nwe have allowed ourselves to be frightened. We are not so evil as we\nmight suspect from the interpretation of dreams.\nIf the evil impulses of the dream are merely infantilism, a return to\nthe beginnings of our ethical development, since the dream simply makes\nchildren of us again in thinking and in feeling, we need not be ashamed\nof these evil dreams if we are reasonable. But being reasonable is only\na part of psychic life. Many things are taking place there that are not\nreasonable, and so it happens that we are ashamed of such dreams, and\nunreasonably. We turn them over to the dream-censorship, are ashamed and\nangry if one of these dreams has in some unusual manner succeeded in\npenetrating into consciousness in an undistorted form, so that we must\nrecognize it--in fact, we are at times just as ashamed of the distorted\ndream as we would be if we understood it. Just think of the scandalized\nopinion of the fine old lady about her uninterpreted dream of \"services\nof love.\" The problem is not yet solved, and it is still possible that\nupon further study of the evil in the dream we shall come to some other\ndecision and arrive at another valuation of human nature.\nAs a result of the whole investigation we grasp two facts, which,\nhowever, disclose only the beginnings of new riddles, new doubts. First:\nthe regression of dream-work is not only formal, it is also of greater\nimport. It not only translates our thoughts into a primitive form of\nexpression, but it reawakens the peculiarities of our primitive psychic\nlife, the ancient predominance of the ego, the earliest impulses of our\nsexual life, even our old intellectual property, if we may consider the\nsymbolic relations as such. And second: We must accredit all these\ninfantilisms which once were governing, and solely governing, to the\nunconscious, about which our ideas now change and are broadened.\nUnconscious is no longer a name for what is at that time latent, the\nunconscious is an especial psychic realm with wish-impulses of its own,\nwith its own method of expression and with a psychic mechanism peculiar\nto itself, all of which ordinarily are not in force. But the latent\ndream-thoughts, which we have solved by means of the dream-interpretation,\nare not of this realm. They are much more nearly the same as any we may\nhave thought in our waking hours. Still they are unconscious; how does\none solve this contradiction? We begin to see that a distinction must be\nmade. Something that originates in our conscious life, and that shares\nits characteristics--we call it the day-remnants--combines in the\ndream-fabrication with something else out of the realm of the\nunconscious. Between these two parts the dream-work completes itself.\nThe influencing of the day-remnants by the unconscious necessitates\nregression. This is the deepest insight into the nature of the dream\nthat we are able to attain without having searched through further\npsychic realms. The time will soon come, however, when we shall clothe\nthe unconscious character of the latent dream-thought with another name,\nwhich shall differentiate it from the unconscious out of the realm of\nthe infantile.\nWe may, to be sure, propound the question: what forces the psychological\nactivity during sleep to such regression? Why do not the sleep\ndisturbing psychic stimuli do the job without it? And if they must,\nbecause of the dream censorship, disguise themselves through old forms\nof expression which are no longer comprehensible, what is the use of\ngiving new life to old, long-outgrown psychic stimuli, wishes and\ncharacter types, that is, why the material regression in addition to the\nformal? The only satisfactory answer would be this, that only in this\nmanner can a dream be built up, that dynamically the dream-stimulus can\nbe satisfied only in this way. But for the time being we have no right\nto give such an answer.\nFOURTEENTH LECTURE\nTHE DREAM\n_Wish Fulfillment_\nMay I bring to your attention once more the ground we have already\ncovered? How, when we met with dream distortion in the application of\nour technique, we decided to leave it alone for the time being, and set\nout to obtain decisive information about the nature of the dream by way\nof infantile dreams? How, then, armed with the results of this\ninvestigation, we attacked dream distortion directly and, I trust, in\nsome measure overcame it? But we must remind ourselves that the results\nwe found along the one way and along the other do not fit together as\nwell as might be. It is now our task to put these two results together\nand balance them against one another.\nFrom both sources we have seen that the dream-work consists essentially\nin the transposition of thoughts into an hallucinatory experience. How\nthat can take place is puzzling enough, but it is a problem of general\npsychology with which we shall not busy ourselves here. We have learned\nfrom the dreams of children that the purpose of the dream-work is the\nsatisfaction of one of the sleep-disturbing psychic stimuli by means of\na wish fulfillment. We were unable to make a similar statement\nconcerning distorted dreams, until we knew how to interpret them. But\nfrom the very beginning we expected to be able to bring the distorted\ndreams under the same viewpoint as the infantile. The earliest\nfulfillment of this expectation led us to believe that as a matter of\nfact all dreams are the dreams of children and that they all work with\ninfantile materials, through childish psychic stimuli and mechanics.\nSince we consider that we have conquered dream-distortion, we must\ncontinue the investigation to see whether our hypothesis of\nwish-fulfillment holds good for distorted dreams also.\nWe very recently subjected a number of dreams to interpretation, but\nleft wish-fulfillment entirely out of consideration. I am convinced that\nthe question again and again occurred to you: \"What about\nwish-fulfillment, which ostensibly is the goal of dream-work?\" This\nquestion is important. It was, in fact, the question of our lay-critics.\nAs you know, humanity has an instinctive antagonism toward intellectual\nnovelties. The expression of such a novelty should immediately be\nreduced to its narrowest limits, if possible, comprised in a commonplace\nphrase. Wish-fulfillment has become that phrase for the new\ndream-science. The layman asks: \"Where is the wish-fulfillment?\"\nImmediately, upon having heard that the dream is supposed to be a\nwish-fulfillment, and indeed, by the very asking of the question, he\nanswers it with a denial. He is at once reminded of countless\ndream-experiences of his own, where his aversion to the dream was\nenormous, so that the proposition of psychoanalytic dream-science seems\nvery improbable to him. It is a simple matter to answer the layman that\nwish-fulfillment cannot be apparent in distorted dreams, but must be\nsought out, so that it is not recognized until the dream is interpreted.\nWe know, too, that the wishes in these distorted dreams are prohibited\nwishes, are wishes rejected by the censor and that their existence lit\nthe very cause of the dream distortion and the reason for the intrusion\nof the dream censor. But it is hard to convince the lay-critic that one\nmay not seek the wish-fulfillment in the dream before the dream has been\ninterpreted. This is continually forgotten. His sceptical attitude\ntoward the theory of wish-fulfillment is really nothing more than a\nconsequence of dream-censorship, a substitute and a result of the denial\nof this censored dream-wish.\nTo be sure, even we shall find it necessary to explain to ourselves why\nthere are so many dreams of painful content, and especially dreams of\nfear. We see here, for the first time, the problem of the affects in the\ndream, a problem worthy of separate investigation, but which\nunfortunately cannot be considered here. If the dream is a\nwish-fulfillment, painful experiences ought to be impossible in the\ndream; in that the lay-critics apparently are right. But three\ncomplications, not thought of by them, must be taken into consideration.\nFirst: It may be that the dream work has not been successful in creating\na wish-fulfillment, so that a part of the painful effect of the\ndream-thought is left over for the manifest dream. Analysis should then\nshow that these thoughts were far more painful even than the dream which\nwas built out of them. This much may be proved in each instance. We\nadmit, then, that the dream work has not achieved its purpose any more\nthan the drink-dream due to the thirst-stimulus has achieved its purpose\nof satisfying the thirst. One remains thirsty, and must wake up in order\nto drink. But it was a real dream, it sacrificed nothing of its nature.\nWe must say: \"Although strength be lacking, let us praise the will to\ndo.\" The clearly recognizable intention, at least, remains praiseworthy.\nSuch cases of miscarriage are not unusual. A contributory cause is this,\nthat it is so much more difficult for the dream work to change affect\ninto content in its own sense; the affects often show great resistance,\nand thus it happens that the dream work has worked the painful content\nof the dream-thoughts over into a wish-fulfillment, while the painful\naffect continues in its unaltered form. Hence in dreams of this type the\naffect does not fit the content at all, and our critics may say the\ndream is so little a wish-fulfillment that a harmless content may be\nexperienced as painful. In answer to this unintelligible remark we say\nthat the wish-fulfillment tendency in the dream-work appears most\nprominent, because isolated, in just such dreams. The error is due to\nthe fact that he who does not know neurotics imagines the connection\nbetween content and affect as all too intimate, and cannot, therefore,\ngrasp the fact that a content may be altered without any corresponding\nchange in the accompanying affect-expression.\nA second, far more important and more extensive consideration, equally\ndisregarded by the layman, is the following: A wish-fulfillment\ncertainly must bring pleasure--but to whom? Naturally, to him who has\nthe wish. But we know from the dreamer that he stands in a very special\nrelationship to his wishes. He casts them aside, censors them, he will\nhave none of them. Their fulfillment gives him no pleasure, but only the\nopposite. Experience then shows that this opposite, which must still be\nexplained, appears in the form of fear. The dreamer in his relation to\nhis dream-wishes can be compared only to a combination of two persons\nbound together by some strong common quality. Instead of further\nexplanations I shall give you a well-known fairy tale, in which you will\nagain find the relationships I have mentioned. A good fairy promises a\npoor couple, husband and wife, to fulfill their first three wishes. They\nare overjoyed, and determine to choose their three wishes with great\ncare. But the woman allows herself to be led astray by the odor of\ncooking sausages emanating from the next cottage, and wishes she had a\ncouple of such sausages. Presto! they are there. This is the first\nwish-fulfillment. Now the husband becomes angry, and in his bitterness\nwishes that the sausages might hang from the end of her nose. This, too,\nis accomplished, and the sausages cannot be removed from their new\nlocation. So this is the second wish-fulfillment, but the wish is that\nof the husband. The wife is very uncomfortable because of the\nfulfillment of this wish. You know how the fairy tale continues. Since\nboth husband and wife are fundamentally one, the third wish must be that\nthe sausages be removed from the nose of the wife. We could make use of\nthis fairy tale any number of times in various connections; here it\nserves only as an illustration of the possibility that the\nwish-fulfillment for the one personality may lead to an aversion on the\npart of the other, if the two do not agree with one another.\nIt will not be difficult now to come to a better understanding of the\nanxiety-dream. We shall make one more observation, then we shall come to\na conclusion to which many things lead. The observation is that the\nanxiety dreams often have a content which is entirely free from\ndistortion and in which the censorship is, so to speak, eluded. The\nanxiety dream is ofttimes an undisguised wish-fulfillment, not, to be\nsure, of an accepted, but of a discarded wish. The anxiety development\nhas stepped into the place of the censorship. While one may assert of\nthe infantile dream that it is the obvious fulfillment of a wish that\nhas gained admittance, and of the distorted dream that it is the\ndisguised fulfillment of a suppressed wish, he must say of the anxiety\ndream that the only suitable formula is this, that it is the obvious\nfulfillment of a suppressed wish. Anxiety is the mark which shows that\nthe suppressed wish showed itself stronger than the censorship, that it\nput through its wish-fulfillment despite the censorship, or was about to\nput it through. We understand that what is wish-fulfillment for the\nsuppressed wish is for us, who are on the side of the dream-censor, only\na painful sensation and a cause for antagonism. The anxiety which\noccurs in dreams is, if you wish, anxiety because of the strength of\nthese otherwise suppressed wishes. Why this antagonism arises in the\nform of anxiety cannot be discovered from a study of the dream alone;\none must obviously study anxiety from other sources.\nWhat holds true for the undistorted anxiety dream we may assume to be\ntrue also of those dreams which have undergone partial distortion, and\nof the other dreams of aversion whose painful impressions very probably\ndenote approximations of anxiety. The anxiety dream is usually also a\ndream that causes waking; we habitually interrupt sleep before the\nsuppressed wish of the dream has accomplished its entire fulfillment in\nopposition to the censorship. In this case the execution of the dream is\nunsuccessful, but this does not change its nature. We have likened the\ndream to the night watchman or sleep-defender who wishes to protect our\nsleep from being disturbed. The night watchman, too, sometimes wakes the\nsleeper when he feels himself too weak to drive away the disturbance or\ndanger all by himself. Yet we are often able to remain asleep, even when\nthe dream begins to become suspicious, and begins to assume the form of\nanxiety. We say to ourselves in our sleep: \"It's only a dream,\" and we\nsleep on.\nWhen does it happen that the dream-wish is in a position to overpower\nthis censorship? The conditions for this may be just as easily furnished\nby the dream-wish as by the dream-censorship. The wish may, for unknown\nreasons, become irresistible; but one gets the impression that more\nfrequently the attitude of the dream censorship is to blame for this\ndisarrangement in the relations of the forces. We have already heard\nthat the censorship works with varying intensity in each single\ninstance, that it handles each element with a different degree of\nstrictness; now we should like to add the proposition that it is an\nextremely variable thing and does not exert equal force on every\noccasion against the same objectionable element. If on occasion the\ncensorship feels itself powerless with respect to a dream-wish which\nthreatens to over-ride it, then, instead of distortion, it makes use of\nthe final means at its disposal, it destroys the sleep condition by the\ndevelopment of anxiety.\nAnd now it occurs to us that we know absolutely nothing yet as to why\nthese evil, depraved wishes are aroused just at night, in order that\nthey may disturb our sleep. The answer can only be an assumption which\nis based on the nature of the condition of sleep. During the day the\nheavy pressure of a censorship weighs upon these wishes, making it\nimpossible, as a rule, for them to express themselves in any manner. At\nnight, evidently, this censorship is withdrawn for the benefit of the\nsingle sleep-wish, in the same manner as are all the other interests of\npsychic life, or at least placed in a position of very minor importance.\nThe forbidden wishes must thank this noctural deposition of the censor\nfor being able to raise their heads again. There are nervous persons\ntroubled with insomnia who admit that their sleeplessness was in the\nbeginning voluntary. They did not trust themselves to fall asleep,\nbecause they were afraid of their dreams, that is, of the results due to\na slackening of the censorship. So you can readily see that this\nwithdrawal of the censor does not in itself signify rank carelessness.\nSleep weakens our power to move; our evil intentions, even if they do\nbegin to stir, can accomplish nothing but a dream, which for practical\npurposes is harmless, and the highly sensible remark of the sleepers, a\nnight-time remark indeed, but not a part of the dream life, \"it is only\na dream,\" is reminiscent of this quieting circumstance. So let us grant\nthis, and sleep on.\nIf, thirdly, you recall the concept that the dreamer, struggling against\nhis wishes, is to be compared to a summation of two separate persons, in\nsome manner closely connected, you will be able to grasp the further\npossibility of how a thing which is highly unpleasant, namely,\npunishment, may be accomplished by wish-fulfillment. Here again the\nfairy tale of the three wishes can be of service to us: the sausages on\nthe plate are the direct wish-fulfillment of the first person, the\nwoman; the sausages at the end of her nose are the wish-fulfillment of\nthe second person, the husband, but at the same time the punishment for\nthe stupid wish of the woman. Among the neurotics we find again the\nmotivation of the third wish, which remains in fairy tales only. There\nare many such punishment-tendencies in the psychic life of man; they are\nvery powerful, and we may make them responsible for some of our painful\ndreams. Perhaps you now say that at this rate, not very much of the\nfamed wish-fulfillment is left. But upon closer view you will admit\nthat you are wrong. In contrast to the many-sided to be discussed, of\nwhat the dream might be--and, according to numerous authors, is--the\nsolution (wish-fulfillment, anxiety-fulfillment, punishment-fulfillment)\nis indeed very restricted. That is why anxiety is the direct antithesis\nof the wish, why antitheses are so closely allied in association and why\nthey occur together in the unconscious, as we have heard; and that is\nwhy punishment, too, is a wish-fulfillment of the other, the censoring\nperson.\nOn the whole, then, I have made no concessions to your protestation\nagainst the theory of wish-fulfillment. We are bound, however, to\nestablish wish-fulfillment in every dream no matter how distorted, and\nwe certainly do not wish to withdraw from this task. Let us go back to\nthe dream, already interpreted, of the three bad theatre tickets for 1\nFl. 50 Kr. from which we have already learned so much. I hope you still\nremember it. A lady who tells her husband during the day that her friend\nElise, only three months younger than herself, has become engaged,\ndreams she is in the theatre with her husband. Half the parquet is\nempty. Her husband says, \"Elise and her fiance wanted to go to the\ntheatre, too, but couldn't because they could get only poor seats, three\nfor one gulden and a half.\" She was of the opinion that that wasn't so\nunfortunate. We discovered that the dream-thought originated in her\ndiscontent at having married too soon, and the fact that she was\ndissatisfied with her husband. We may be curious as to the manner in\nwhich these thoughts have been worked over into a wish-fulfillment, and\nwhere their traces may be found in the manifest content. Now we know\nthat the element \"too soon, premature\" is eliminated from the dream by\nthe censor. The empty parquet is a reference to it. The puzzling \"three\nfor 1 Fl. 50 Kr.\" is now, with the help of symbolism which we have since\nlearned, more understandable.[36] The \"3\" really means a husband, and\nthe manifest element is easy to translate: to buy a husband for her\ndowry (\"I could have bought one ten times better for my dowry\"). The\nmarriage is obviously replaced by going into the theatre. \"Buying the\ntickets too soon\" directly takes the place of the premature marriage.\nThis substitution is the work of the wish-fulfillment. Our dreamer was\nnot always so dissatisfied with her early marriage as she was on the day\nshe received news of the engagement of her friend. At the time she was\nproud of her marriage and felt herself more favored than her friend.\nNaive girls have frequently confided to their friends after their\nengagement that soon they, too, will be able to go to all the plays\nhitherto forbidden, and see everything. The desire to see plays, the\ncuriosity that makes its appearance here, was certainly in the beginning\ndirected towards sex matters, the sex-life, especially the sex-life of\nthe parents, and then became a strong motive which impelled the girl to\nan early marriage. In this way the visit to the theatre becomes an\nobvious representative substitute for being married. In the momentary\nannoyance at her early marriage she recalls the time when the early\nmarriage was a wish-fulfillment for her, because she had satisfied her\ncuriosity; and she now replaces the marriage, guided by the old\nwish-impulse, with the going to the theatre.\nWe may say that we have not sought out the simplest example as proof of\na hidden wish-fulfillment. We would have to proceed in analogous manner\nwith other distorted dreams. I cannot do that for you, and simply wish\nto express the conviction that it will be successful everywhere. But I\nwish to continue along this theoretical line. Experience has taught me\nthat it is one of the most dangerous phases of the entire dream science,\nand that many contradictions and misunderstandings are connected\ntherewith. Besides, you are perhaps still under the impression that I\nhave retracted a part of my declaration, in that I said that the dream\nis a fulfilled wish or its opposite, an actualized anxiety or\npunishment, and you will think this is the opportunity to compel further\nreservations of me. I have also heard complaints that I am too abrupt\nabout things which appear evident to me, and that for that reason I do\nnot present the thing convincingly enough.\nIf a person has gone thus far with us in dream-interpretation, and\naccepted everything that has been offered, it is not unusual for him to\ncall a halt at wish-fulfillment, and say, \"Granted that in every\ninstance the dream has a meaning, and that this meaning can be disclosed\nby psychoanalytic technique, why must this dream, despite all evidence\nto the contrary, always be forced into the formula of wish-fulfillment?\nWhy might not the meaning of this nocturnal thought be as many-sided as\nthought is by day; why may not the dream in one case express a fulfilled\nwish, in another, as you yourself say, the opposite thereof, an\nactualized anxiety; or why may it not correspond to a resolution, a\nwarning, a reflection with its pro's and con's, a reproach, a goad to\nconscience, an attempt to prepare oneself for a contemplated\nperformance, etc? Why always nothing more than a wish, or at best, its\nopposite?\"\nOne might maintain that a difference of opinion on these points is of no\ngreat importance, so long as we are at one otherwise. We might say that\nit is enough to have discovered the meaning of the dream, and the way to\nrecognize it; that it is a matter of no importance, if we have too\nnarrowly limited this meaning. But this is not so. A misunderstanding of\nthis point strikes at the nature of our knowledge of the dream, and\nendangers its worth for the understanding of neuroses. Then, too, that\nmethod of approach which is esteemed in the business world as genteel is\nout of place in scientific endeavors, and harmful.\nMy first answer to the question why the dream may not be many-sided in\nits meaning is the usual one in such instances: I do not know why it\nshould not be so. I would not be opposed to such a state of affairs. As\nfar as I am concerned, it could well be true. Only one small matter\nprevents this broader and more comfortable explanation of the\ndream--namely, that as a matter of fact it isn't so. My second answer\nemphasizes the fact that the assumption that the dream corresponds to\nnumerous forms of thought and intellectual operations is no stranger to\nme. In a story about a sick person I once reported a dream that occurred\nthree nights running and then stopped, and I explained this suppression\nby saying that the dream corresponded to a resolution which had no\nreason to recur after having been carried out. More recently I published\na dream which corresponded to a confession. How is it possible for me to\ncontradict myself, and maintain that the dream is always only a\nfulfilled wish?\nI do that, because I do not wish to admit a stupid misunderstanding\nwhich might cost us the fruits of all our labors with regard to the\ndream, a misunderstanding which confuses the dream with the latent\ndream-thought and affirms of the dream something that applies\nspecifically and solely to the latter. For it is entirely correct that\nthe dream can represent, and be replaced by all those things we\nenumerated: a resolution, a warning, reflection, preparation, an attempt\nto solve a problem, etc. But if you look closely, you will recognize\nthat all these things are true only of the latent dream thoughts, which\nhave been changed about in the dream. You learn from the interpretation\nof the dreams that the person's unconscious thinking is occupied with\nsuch resolutions, preparations, reflections, etc., out of which the\ndream-work then builds the dream. If you are not at the time interested\nin the dream-work, but are very much interested in the unconscious\nthought-work of man, you eliminate the dream-work, and say of the dream,\nfor all practical purposes quite correctly, that it corresponds to a\nwarning, a resolution, etc. This often happens in psychoanalytic\nactivity. People endeavor for the most part only to destroy the dream\nform, and to substitute in its place in the sequence the latent thoughts\nout of which the dream was made.\nThus we learn, from the appreciation of the latent dream-thoughts, that\nall the highly complicated psychic acts we have enumerated can go on\nunconsciously, a result as wonderful as it is confusing.\nBut to return, you are right only if you admit that you have made use of\nan abbreviated form of speech, and if you do not believe that you must\nconnect the many-sidedness we have mentioned with the essence of the\ndream. When you speak of the dream you must mean either the manifest\ndream, i.e., the product of the dream-work, or at most the dream-work\nitself--that psychic occurrence which forms the manifest dream out of\nthe latent dream thought. Any other use of the word is a confusion of\nconcept that can only cause trouble. If your assertions refer to the\nlatent thoughts back of the dream, say so, and do not cloud the problem\nof the dream by using such a faulty means of expression. The latent\ndream thoughts are the material which the dream-work remolds into the\nmanifest dream. Why do you insist upon confusing the material with the\nwork that makes use of it? Are you any better off than those who knew\nonly the product of this work, and could explain neither where it came\nfrom nor how it was produced?\nThe only essential thing in the dream is the dream-work that has had\nits influence upon the thought-material. We have no right to disregard\nit theoretically even if, in certain practical situations, we may fail\nto take it into account. Analytic observation, too, shows that the\ndream-work never limits itself to translating these thoughts in the\narchaic or regressive mode of expression known to you. Rather it\nregularly adds something which does not belong to the latent thoughts of\nwaking, but which is the essential motive of dream-formation. This\nindispensable ingredient is at the same time the unconscious wish, for\nthe fulfillment of which the dream content is rebuilt. The dream may be\nany conceivable thing, if you take into account only the thoughts\nrepresented by it, warning, resolution, preparation, etc.; it is also\nalways the fulfillment of an unknown wish, and it is this only if you\nlook upon it as the result of the dream-work. A dream is never itself a\nresolution, a warning, and no more--but always a resolution, etc.,\ntranslated into an archaic form of expression with the help of the\nunconscious wish, and changed about for the purpose of fulfilling this\nwish. The one characteristic, wish-fulfillment, is constant; the other\nmay vary; it may itself be a wish at times, so that the dream, with the\naid of an unconscious wish, presents as fulfilled a latent wish out of\nwaking hours.\nI understand all this very well, but I do not know whether or not I\nshall be successful in making you understand it as well. I have\ndifficulties, too, in proving it to you. This cannot be done without, on\nthe one hand, careful analysis of many dreams, and on the other hand\nthis most difficult and most important point of our conception of the\ndream cannot be set forth convincingly without reference to things to\nfollow. Can you, in fact, believe that taking into consideration the\nintimate relationship of all things, one is able to penetrate deeply\ninto the nature of one thing without having carefully considered other\nthings of a very similar nature? Since we know nothing as yet about the\nclosest relatives of the dream, neurotic symptoms, we must once again\ncontent ourselves with what has already been accomplished. I want to\nexplain one more example to you, and propose a new viewpoint.\nLet us again take up that dream to which we have several times recurred,\nthe dream of the three theatre tickets for 1 Fl. 50 Kr. I can assure you\nthat I took this example quite unpremeditatedly at first. You are\nacquainted with the latent dream thoughts: annoyance, upon hearing that\nher friend had just now become engaged, at the thought that she herself\nhad hurried so to be married; contempt for her husband; the idea that\nshe might have had a better one had she waited. We also know the wish,\nwhich made a dream out of these thoughts--it is \"curiosity to see,\"\nbeing permitted to go to the theatre, very likely a derivation from the\nold curiosity finally to know just what happens when one is married.\nThis curiosity, as is well known, regularly directs itself in the case\nof children to the sex-life of the parents. It is an impulse of\nchildhood, and in so far as it persists later, an impulse whose roots\nreach back into the infantile. But that day's news played no part in\nawaking the curiosity, it awoke only annoyance and regret. This wish\nimpulse did not have anything to do immediately with the latent dream\nthoughts, and we could fit the result of the dream interpretation into\nthe analysis without considering the wish impulse at all. But then, the\nannoyance itself was not capable of producing the dream; a dream could\nnot be derived from the thought: \"It was stupid to marry so soon,\"\nexcept by reviving the old wish finally to see what happens when one is\nmarried. The wish then formed the dream content, in that it replaced\nmarriage by going to the theatre, and gave it the form of an earlier\nwish-fulfillment: \"so now I may go to the theatre and see all the\nforbidden things, and you may not. I am married and you must wait.\" In\nsuch a manner the present situation was transposed into its opposite, an\nold triumph put into the place of the recent defeat. Added thereto was a\nsatisfied curiosity amalgamated with a satisfied egoistic sense of\nrivalry. This satisfaction determines the manifest dream content in\nwhich she really is sitting in the theatre, and her friend was unable to\nget tickets. Those bits of dream content are affixed to this\nsatisfaction situation as unfitting and inexplicable modifications,\nbehind which the latent dream thoughts still hide. Dream interpretation\nmust take into consideration everything that serves toward the\nrepresentation of the wish-fulfillment and must reconstruct from these\nsuggestions the painful latent dream-thought.\nThe observation I now wish to make is for the purpose of drawing your\nattention to the latent, dream thoughts, now pushed to the fore. I beg\nof you not to forget first, that the dreamer is unconscious of them,\nsecond, they are entirely logical and continuous, so that they may be\nunderstood as a comprehensible reaction to the dream occasion, third,\nthat they may have the value of any desired psychic impulse or\nintellectual operation. I shall now designate these thoughts more\nforcibly than before as \"day-remnants\"; the dreamer may acknowledge them\nor not. I now separate day-remnants and latent dream thoughts in\naccordance with our previous usage of calling everything that we\ndiscover in interpreting the dream \"latent dream thoughts,\" while the\nday-remnants are only a part of the latent dream thoughts. Then our\nconception goes to show that something additional has been added to the\nday-remnants, something which also belonged to the unconscious, a strong\nbut suppressed wish impulse, and it is this alone that has made possible\nthe dream fabrication. The influence of this wish impulse on the\nday-remnants creates the further participation of the latent dream\nthoughts, thoughts which no longer appear rational and understandable in\nrelation to waking life.\nIn explaining the relationship of the day-remnants to the unconscious\nwish I have made use of a comparison which I can only repeat here. Every\nundertaking requires a capitalist, who defrays the expenses, and an\nentrepreneur, who has the idea and understands how to carry it out. The\nrole of the capitalist in the dream fabrication is always played by the\nunconscious wish; it dispenses the psychic energy for dream-building.\nThe actual worker is the day-remnant, which determines how the\nexpenditure is to be made. Now the capitalist may himself have the idea\nand the particularized knowledge, or the entrepreneur may have the\ncapital. This simplifies the practical situation, but makes its\ntheoretical comprehension more difficult. In economics we always\ndistinguish between the capitalist and the entrepreneur aspect in a\nsingle person, and thus we reconstruct the fundamental situation which\nwas the point of departure for our comparison. In dream-fabrication the\nsame variations occur. I shall leave their further development to you.\nWe can go no further here, for you have probably long been disturbed by\na reflection which deserves to be heard. Are the day-remnants, you ask,\nreally unconscious in the same sense as the unconscious wish which is\nessential to making them suitable for the dream? You discern correctly.\nHere lies the salient point of the whole affair. They are not\nunconscious in the same sense. The dream wish belongs to a different\nunconsciousness, that which we have recognized as of infantile origin,\nfitted out with special mechanisms. It is entirely appropriate to\nseparate these two types of unconsciousness and give them different\ndesignations. But let us rather wait until we have become acquainted\nwith the field of neurotic symptoms. If people say one unconsciousness\nis fantastic, what will they say when we acknowledge that we arrived at\nour conclusions by using two kinds of unconsciousness?\nLet us stop here. Once more you have heard something incomplete; but is\nthere not hope in the thought that this science has a continuation which\nwill be brought to light either by ourselves or by those to follow? And\nhave not we ourselves discovered a sufficient number of new and\nsurprising things?\nFIFTEENTH LECTURE\nTHE DREAM\n_Doubtful Points and Criticism_\nLet us not leave the subject of dreams before we have touched upon the\nmost common doubts and uncertainties which have arisen in connection\nwith the new ideas and conceptions we have discussed up to this point.\nThe more attentive members of the audience probably have already\naccumulated some material bearing upon this.\n1. You may have received the impression that the results of our work of\ninterpretation of the dream have left so much that is uncertain, despite\nour close adherence to technique, that a true translation of the\nmanifest dream into the latent dream thoughts is thereby rendered\nimpossible. In support of this you will point out that in the first\nplace, one never knows whether a specific element of the dream is to be\ntaken literally or symbolically, since those elements which are used\nsymbolically do not, because of that fact, cease to be themselves. But\nif one has no objective standard by which to decide this, the\ninterpretation is, as to this point, left to the discretion of the dream\ninterpreter. Moreover, because of the way in which the dream work\ncombines opposites, it is always uncertain whether a specific dream\nelement is to be taken in the positive or the negative sense, whether it\nis to be understood as itself or as its opposite. Hence this is another\nopportunity for the exercise of the interpreter's discretion. In the\nthird place, in consequence of the frequency with which every sort of\ninversion is practised in the dream, the dream interpreter is at liberty\nto assume such an inversion at any point of the dream he pleases. And\nfinally you will say, you have heard that one is seldom sure that the\ninterpretation which is found is the only possible one. There is danger\nof overlooking a thoroughly admissible second interpretation of the\nsame dream. Under these circumstances, you will conclude there is a\nscope left for the discretion of the interpreter, the breadth of which\nseems incompatible with the objective accuracy of the results. Or you\nmay also conclude that the fault does not rest with the dream but that\nthe inadequacies of our dream interpretation result from errors in our\nconceptions and hypotheses.\nAll your material is irreproachable, but I do not believe that it\njustifies your conclusions in two directions, namely, that dream\ninterpretation as we practice it is sacrificed to arbitrariness and that\nthe deficiency of our results makes the justification of our method\ndoubtful. If you will substitute for the arbitrariness of the\ninterpreter, his skill, his experience, his comprehension, I agree with\nyou. We shall surely not be able to dispense with some such personal\nfactor, particularly not in difficult tasks of dream interpretation. But\nthis same state of affairs exists also in other scientific occupations.\nThere is no way in which to make sure that one man will not wield a\ntechnique less well, or utilize it more fully, than another. What might,\nfor example, impress you as arbitrariness in the interpretation of\nsymbols, is compensated for by the fact that as a rule the connection of\nthe dream thoughts among themselves, the connection of the dream with\nthe life of the dreamer, and the whole psychic situation in which the\ndream occurs, chooses just one of the possible interpretations advanced\nand rejects the others as useless for its purposes. The conclusion drawn\nfrom the inadequacies of dream interpretation, that our hypotheses are\nwrong, is weakened by an observation which shows that the ambiguity and\nindefiniteness of the dream is rather characteristic and necessarily to\nbe expected.\nRecollect that we said that the dream work translates the dream thoughts\ninto primitive expressions analogous to picture writing. All these\nprimitive systems of expression are, however, subject to such\nindefiniteness and ambiguities, but it does not follow that we are\njustified in doubting their usefulness. You know that the fusion of\nopposites by the dream-work is analogous to the so-called \"antithetical\nmeaning of primitive words,\" in the oldest languages. The philologist,\nR. Abel (1884), whom we have to thank for this point of view, admonishes\nus not to believe that the meaning of the communication which one\nperson made to another when using such ambiguous words was necessarily\nunclear. Tone and gesture used in connection with the words would have\nleft no room for doubt as to which of the two opposites the speaker\nintended to communicate. In writing, where gesture is lacking, it was\nreplaced by a supplementary picture sign not intended to be spoken, as\nfor example by the picture of a little man squatting lazily or standing\nerect, according to whether the ambiguous hieroglyphic was to mean\n\"weak\" or \"strong.\" It was in this way that one avoided any\nmisunderstanding despite the ambiguity of the sounds and signs.\nWe recognize in the ancient systems of expression, e.g., the writings of\nthose oldest languages, a number of uncertainties which we would not\ntolerate in our present-day writings. Thus in many Semitic writings only\nthe consonants of words are indicated. The reader had to supply the\nomitted vowels according to his knowledge and the context. Hieroglyphic\nwriting does not proceed in exactly this way, but quite similarly, and\nthat is why the pronunciation of old Egyptian has remained unknown to\nus. The holy writings of the Egyptians contain still other\nuncertainties. For example, it is left to the discretion of the writer\nwhether or not he shall arrange the pictures from right to left or from\nleft to right. To be able to read we have to follow the rule that we\nmust depend upon the faces of the figures, birds, and the like. The\nwriter, however, could also arrange the picture signs in vertical rows,\nand in inscriptions on small objects he was guided by considerations of\nbeauty and proportion further to change the order of the signs. Probably\nthe most confusing feature of hieroglyphic writing is to be found in the\nfact that there is no space between words. The pictures stretch over the\npage at uniform distances from one another, and generally one does not\nknow whether a sign belongs to what has gone before or is the beginning\nof a new word. Persian cuneiform writing, on the other hand, makes use\nof an oblique wedge sign to separate the words.\nThe Chinese tongue and script is exceedingly old, but still used by four\nhundred million people. Please do not think I understand anything about\nit. I have only informed myself concerning it because I hoped to find\nanalogies to the indefinite aspects of the dream. Nor was I\ndisappointed. The Chinese language is filled with so many vagaries that\nit strikes terror into our hearts. It consists, as is well known, of a\nnumber of syllable sounds which are spoken singly or are combined in\ntwos. One of the chief dialects has about four hundred such sounds. Now\nsince the vocabulary of this dialect is estimated at about four thousand\nwords, it follows that every sound has on an average of ten different\nmeanings, some less but others, consequently, more. Hence there are a\ngreat number of ways of avoiding a multiplicity of meaning, since one\ncannot guess from the context alone which of the ten meanings of the\nsyllable sound the speaker intended to convey to the hearer. Among them\nare the combining of two sounds into a compounded word and the use of\nfour different \"tones\" with which to utter these syllables. For our\npurposes of comparison, it is still more interesting to note that this\nlanguage has practically no grammar. It is impossible to say of a\none-syllable word whether it is a noun, a verb, or an adjective, and we\nfind none of those changes in the forms of the words by means of which\nwe might recognize sex, number, ending, tense or mood. The language,\ntherefore, might be said to consist of raw material, much in the same\nmanner as our thought language is broken up by the dream work into its\nraw materials when the expressions of relationship are left out. In the\nChinese, in all cases of vagueness the decision is left to the\nunderstanding of the hearer, who is guided by the context. I have\nsecured an example of a Chinese saying which, literally translated,\nreads: \"Little to be seen, much to wonder at.\" That is not difficult to\nunderstand. It may mean, \"The less a man has seen, the more he finds to\nwonder at,\" or, \"There is much to admire for the man who has seen\nlittle.\" Naturally, there is no need to choose between these two\ntranslations, which differ only in grammar. Despite these uncertainties,\nwe are assured, the Chinese language is an extraordinarily excellent\nmedium for the expression of thought. Vagueness does not, therefore,\nnecessarily lead to ambiguity.\nNow we must certainly admit that the condition of affairs is far less\nfavorable in the expression-system of the dream than in these ancient\nlanguages and writings. For, after all, these latter are really designed\nfor communication, that is to say, they were always intended to be\nunderstood, no matter in what way and with what aids. But it is just\nthis characteristic which the dream lacks. The dream does not want to\ntell anyone anything, it is no vehicle of communication, it is, on the\ncontrary, constructed so as not to be understood. For that reason we\nmust not be surprised or misled if we should discover that a number of\nthe ambiguities and vagaries of the dream do not permit of\ndetermination. As the one specific gain of our comparison, we have only\nthe realization that such uncertainties as people tried to make use of\nin objecting to the validity of our dream interpretation, are rather the\ninvariable characteristic of all primitive systems of expression.\nHow far the dream can really be understood can be determined only by\npractice and experience. My opinion is, that that is very far indeed,\nand the comparison of results which correctly trained analysts have\ngathered confirms my view. The lay public, even that part of the lay\npublic which is interested in science, likes, in the face of the\ndifficulties and uncertainties of a scientific task, to make what I\nconsider an unjust show of its superior scepticism. Perhaps not all of\nyou are acquainted with the fact that a similar situation arose in the\nhistory of the deciphering of the Babylonian-Assyrian inscriptions.\nThere was a period then when public opinion went far in declaring the\ndecipherors of cuneiform writing to be visionaries and the whole\nresearch a \"fraud.\" But in the year 1857 the Royal Asiatic Society made\na decisive test. It challenged the four most distinguished decipherors\nof cuneiform writing, Rawlinson, Hincks, Fox Talbot and Oppert, each to\nsend to it in a sealed envelope his independent translation of a newly\ndiscovered inscription, and the Society was then able to testify, after\nhaving made a comparison of the four readings, that their agreement was\nsufficiently marked to justify confidence in what already had been\naccomplished, and faith in further progress. At this the mockery of the\nlearned lay world gradually came to an end and the confidence in the\nreading of cuneiform documents has grown appreciably since then.\n2. A second series of objections is firmly grounded in the impression\nfrom which you too probably are not free, that a number of the solutions\nof dream interpretations which we find it necessary to make seem forced,\nartificial, far-fetched, in other words, violent or even comical or\njocose. These comments are so frequent that I shall choose at random the\nlatest example which has come to my attention. Recently, in free\nSwitzerland, the director of a boarding-school was relieved of his\nposition on account of his active interest in psychoanalysis. He raised\nobjections and a Berne newspaper made public the judgment of the school\nauthorities. I quote from that article some sentences which apply to\npsychoanalysis: \"Moreover, we are surprised at the many far-fetched and\nartificial examples as found in the aforementioned book of Dr. Pfister\nof Zurich.... Thus, it certainly is a cause of surprise when the\ndirector of a boarding-school so uncritically accepts all these\nassertions and apparent proofs.\" These observations are offered as the\ndecisions of \"one who judges calmly.\" I rather think this calm is\n\"artificial.\" Let us examine these remarks more closely in the hope that\na little reflection and knowledge of the subject can be no detriment to\ncalm judgment.\nIt is positively refreshing to see how quickly and unerringly some\nindividuals can judge a delicate question of abstruse psychology by\nfirst impressions. The interpretations seem to them far-fetched and\nforced, they do not please them, so the interpretations are wrong and\nthe whole business of interpretation amounts to nothing. No fleeting\nthought ever brushes the other possibility, that these interpretations\nmust appear as they are for good reasons, which would give rise to the\nfurther question of what these good reasons might be.\nThe content thus judged generally relates to the results of\ndisplacement, with which you have become acquainted as the strongest\ndevice of the dream censor. It is with the help of displacements that\nthe dream censor creates substitute-formations which we have designated\nas allusions. But they are allusions which are not easily recognized as\nsuch, and from which it is not easy to find one's way back to the\noriginal and which are connected with this original by means of the\nstrangest, most unusual, most superficial associations. In all of these\ncases, however, it is a question of matters which are to be hidden,\nwhich were intended for concealment; this is what the dream censor aims\nto do. We must not expect to find a thing that has been concealed in its\naccustomed place in the spot where it belongs. In this respect the\nCommissions for the Surveillance of Frontiers now in office are more\ncunning than the Swiss school authorities. In their search for documents\nand maps they are not content to search through portfolios and letter\ncases but they also take into account the possibility that spies and\nsmugglers might carry such severely proscribed articles in the most\nconcealed parts of their clothing, where they certainly do not belong,\nas for example between the double soles of their boots. If the concealed\nobjects are found in such a place, they certainly are very far-fetched,\nbut nevertheless they have been \"fetched.\"\nIf we recognize that the most remote, the most extraordinary\nassociations between the latent dream element and its manifest\nsubstitute are possible, associations appearing ofttimes comical,\nofttimes witty, we follow in so doing a wealth of experience derived\nfrom examples whose solutions we have, as a rule, not found ourselves.\nOften it is not possible to give such interpretations from our own\nexamples. No sane person could guess the requisite association. The\ndreamer either gives us the translation with one stroke by means of his\nimmediate association--he can do this, for this substitute formation was\ncreated by his mind--or he provides us with so much material that the\nsolution no longer demands any special astuteness but forces itself upon\nus as inevitable. If the dreamer does not help us in either of these two\nways, then indeed the manifest element in question remains forever\nincomprehensible to us. Allow me to give you one more such example of\nrecent occurrence. One of my patients lost her father during the time\nthat she was undergoing treatment. Since then she has made use of every\nopportunity to bring him back to life in her dreams. In one of her\ndreams her father appears in a certain connection, of no further\nimportance here, and says, \"_It is a quarter past eleven, it is half\npast eleven, it is quarter of twelve_.\" All she can think of in\nconnection with this curious incident is the recollection that her\nfather liked to see his grown-up children appear punctually at the\ngeneral meal hour. That very thing probably had some connection with the\ndream element, but permitted of no conclusion as to its source. Judging\nfrom the situation of the treatment at that time, there was a justified\nsuspicion that a carefully suppressed critical rebellion against her\nloved and respected father played its part in this dream. Continuing her\nassociations, and apparently far afield from topics relevant to the\ndream, the dreamer relates that yesterday many things of a\npsychological nature had been discussed in her presence, and that a\nrelative made the remark: \"The cave man (_Urmensch_) continues to live\nin all of us.\" Now we think we understand. That gave her an excellent\nopportunity of picturing her father as continuing to live. So in the\ndream she made of him a clockman (_Uhrmensch_) by having him announce\nthe quarter-hours at noon time.\nYou may not be able to disregard the similarity which this examples\nbears to a pun, and it really has happened frequently that the dreamer's\npun is attributed to the interpreter. There are still other examples in\nwhich it is not at all easy to decide whether one is dealing with a joke\nor a dream. But you will recall that the same doubt confronted us when\nwe were dealing with slips of the tongue. A man tells us a dream of his,\nthat his uncle, while they were sitting in the latter's _auto_mobile,\ngave him a kiss. He very quickly supplies the interpretation himself. It\nmeans \"_auto_-eroticism,\" (a term taken from the study of the libido, or\nlove impulse, and designating satisfaction of that impulse without an\nexternal object). Did this man permit himself to make fun of us and give\nout as a dream a pun that occurred to him? I do not believe so; he\nreally dreamed it. Whence comes the astounding similarity? This question\nat one time led me quite a ways from my path, by making it necessary for\nme to make a thorough investigation of the problem of humor itself. By\nso doing I came to the conclusion that the origin of wit lies in a\nforeconscious train of thought which is left for a moment to unconscious\nmanipulation, from which it then emerges as a joke. Under the influence\nof the unconscious it experiences the workings of the mechanisms there\nin force, namely, of condensation and displacement, that is, of the same\nprocesses which we found active in the dream work, and it is to this\nagreement that we are to ascribe the similarity between wit and the\ndream, wherever it occurs. The unintentional \"dream joke\" has, however,\nnone of the pleasure-giving quality of the ordinary joke. Why that is\nso, greater penetration into the study of wit may teach you. The \"dream\njoke\" seems a poor joke to us, it does not make us laugh, it leaves us\ncold.\nHere we are also following in the footsteps of ancient dream\ninterpretation, which has left us, in addition to much that is useless,\nmany a good example of dream interpretation we ourselves cannot\nsurpass. I am now going to tell you a dream of historical importance\nwhich Plutarch and Artemidorus of Daldis both tell concerning Alexander\nthe Great, with certain variations. When the King was engaged in\nbesieging the city of Tyre (322 B.C.), which was being stubbornly\ndefended, he once dreamed that he saw a dancing satyr. Aristandros, his\ndream interpreter, who accompanied the army, interpreted this dream for\nhim by making of the word _Satyros_, [Greek] sa Turos, \"Thine is\nTyre,\" and thus promising him a triumph over the city. Alexander allowed\nhimself to be influenced by this interpretation to continue the siege,\nand finally captured Tyre. The interpretation, which seems artificial\nenough, was without doubt the correct one.\n3. I can imagine that it will make a special impression on you to hear\nthat objections to our conception of the dream have been raised also by\npersons who, as psychoanalysts, have themselves been interested in the\ninterpretation of dreams. It would have been too extraordinary if so\npregnant an opportunity for new errors had remained unutilized, and\nthus, owing to comprehensible confusions and unjustified\ngeneralizations, there have been assertions made which, in point of\nincorrectness are not far behind the medical conception of dreams. One\nof these you already know. It is the declaration that the dream is\noccupied with the dreamer's attempts at adaptation to his present\nenvironment, and attempts to solve future problems, in other words, that\nthe dream follows a \"prospective tendency\" (A. Maeder). We have already\nshown that this assertion is based upon a confusion of the dream with\nthe latent thoughts of the dream, that as a premise it overlooks the\nexistence of the dream-work. In characterizing that psychic activity\nwhich is unconscious and to which the latent thoughts of the dream\nbelong, the above assertion is no novelty, nor is it exhaustive, for\nthis unconscious psychic activity occupies itself with many other things\nbesides preparation for the future. A much worse confusion seems to\nunderlie the assurance that back of every dream one finds the\n\"death-clause,\" or death-wish. I am not quite certain what this formula\nis meant to indicate, but I suppose that back of it is a confusion of\nthe dream with the whole personality of the dreamer.\nAn unjustified generalization, based on few good examples, is the\npronouncement that every dream permits of two interpretations, one such\nas we have explained, the so-called psychoanalytic, and another, the\nso-called anagogical or mystical, which ignores the instinctive impulses\nand aims at a representation of the higher psychic functions (V.\nSilberer). There are such dreams, but you will try in vain to extend\nthis conception to even a majority of the dreams. But after everything\nyou have heard, the statement will seem very incomprehensible that all\ndreams can be interpreted bisexually, that is, as the concurrence of two\ntendencies which may be designated as male and female (A. Adler). To be\nsure, there are a few such dreams, and you may learn later that these\nare built up in the manner of certain hysterical symptoms. I mention all\nthese newly discovered general characteristics of the dream in order to\nwarn you against them or at least in order not to leave you in doubt as\nto how I judge them.\n4. At one time the objective value of dream research was called into\nquestion by the observation that patients undergoing analysis\naccommodate the content of their dreams to the favorite theories of\ntheir physicians, so that some dream predominantly of sexual impulses,\nothers of the desire for power and still others even of rebirth (W.\nStekel). The weight of this observation is diminished by the\nconsideration that people dreamed before there was such a thing as a\npsychoanalytic treatment to influence their dreams, and that those who\nare now undergoing treatment were also in the habit of dreaming before\nthe treatment was commenced. The meaning of this novel discovery can\nsoon be recognized as a matter of course and as of no consequence for\nthe theory of the dream. Those day-remnants which give rise to the dream\nare the overflow from the strong interest of the waking life. If the\nremarks of the physician and the stimuli which he gives have become\nsignificant to the patient under analysis, then they become a part of\nthe day's remnants, can serve as psychic stimuli for the formation of a\ndream along with other, emotionally-charged, unsolved interests of the\nday, and operate much as do the somatic stimuli which act upon the\nsleeper during his sleep. Just like these other incitors of the dream,\nthe sequence of ideas which the physician sets in motion may appear in\nthe manifest content, or may be traced in the latent content of the\ndream. Indeed, we know that one can produce dreams experimentally, or to\nspeak more accurately, one can insert into the dream a part of the\ndream material. Thus the analyst in influencing his patients, merely\nplays the role of an experimenter in the manner of Mourly Vold, who\nplaces the limbs of his subjects in certain positions.\nOne can often influence the dreamer as to the _subject-matter_ of his\ndream, but one can never influence _what he will dream_ about it. The\nmechanism of the dream-work and the unconscious wish that is hidden in\nthe dream are beyond the reach of all foreign influences. We already\nrealized, when we evaluated the dreams caused by bodily stimuli, that\nthe peculiarity and self-sufficiency of the dream life shows itself in\nthe reaction with which the dream retorts to the bodily or physical\nstimuli which are presented. The statement here discussed, which aims to\nthrow doubt upon the objectivity of dream research, is again based on a\nconfusion--this time of the whole dream with the dream material.\nThis much, ladies and gentlemen, I wanted to tell you concerning the\nproblems of the dream. You will suspect that I have omitted a great\ndeal, and have yourselves discovered that I had to be inconclusive on\nalmost all points. But that is due to the relation which the phenomena\nof the dream have to those of the neuroses. We studied the dream by way\nof introduction to the study of the neuroses, and that was surely more\ncorrect than the reverse would have been. But just as the dream prepares\nus for the understanding of the neuroses, so in turn the correct\nevaluation of the dream can only be gained after a knowledge of neurotic\nphenomena has been won.\nI do not know what you will think about this, but I must assure you that\nI do not regret having taken so much of your interest and of your\navailable time for the problems of the dream. There is no other field in\nwhich one can so quickly become convinced of the correctness of the\nassertions by which psychoanalysis stands or falls. It will take the\nstrenuous labor of many months, even years, to show that the symptoms in\na case of neurotic break-down have their meaning, serve a purpose, and\nresult from the fortunes of the patient. On the other hand, the efforts\nof a few hours suffice in proving the same content in a dream product\nwhich at first seems incomprehensibly confused, and thereby to confirm\nall the hypotheses of psychoanalysis, the unconsciousness of psychic\nprocesses, the special mechanism which they follow, and the motive\nforces which manifest themselves in them. And if we associate the\nthorough analogy in the construction of the dream and the neurotic\nsymptom with the rapidity of transformation which makes of the dreamer\nan alert and reasonable individual, we gain the certainty that the\nneurosis also is based only on a change in the balance of the forces of\npsychic life.\nIII\nGENERAL THEORY OF THE NEUROSES\nSIXTEENTH LECTURE\nGENERAL THEORY OF THE NEUROSES\n_Psychoanalysis and Psychiatry_\nI am very glad to welcome you back to continue our discussions. I last\nlectured to you on the psychoanalytic treatment of errors and of the\ndream. To-day I should like to introduce you to an understanding of\nneurotic phenomena, which, as you soon will discover, have much in\ncommon with both of those topics. But I shall tell you in advance that I\ncannot leave you to take the same attitude toward me that you had\nbefore. At that time I was anxious to take no step without complete\nreference to your judgment. I discussed much with you, I listened to\nyour objections, in short, I deferred to you and to your \"normal common\nsense.\" That is no longer possible, and for a very simple reason. As\nphenomena, the dream and errors were not strange to you. One might say\nthat you had as much experience as I, or that you could easily acquire\nas much. But neuroses are foreign to you; since you are not doctors\nyourselves you have had access to them only through what I have told\nyou. Of what use is the best judgment if it is not supported by\nfamiliarity with the material in question?\nDo not, however, understand this as an announcement of dogmatic lectures\nwhich demand your unconditional belief. That would be a gross\nmisunderstanding. I do not wish to convince you. I am out to stimulate\nyour interest and shake your prejudices. If, in consequence of not\nknowing the facts, you are not in a position to judge, neither should\nyou believe nor condemn. Listen and allow yourselves to be influenced by\nwhat I tell you. One cannot be so easily convinced; at least if he comes\nby convictions without effort, they soon prove to be valueless and\nunable to hold their own. He only has a right to conviction who has\nhandled the same material for many years and who in so doing has gone\nthrough the same new and surprising experiences again and again. Why, in\nmatters of intellect these lightning conversions, these momentary\nrepulsions? Do you not feel that a _coup de foudre_, that love at first\nsight, originates in quite a different field, namely, in that of the\nemotions? We do not even demand that our patients should become\nconvinced of and predisposed to psychoanalysis. When they do, they seem\nsuspicious to us. The attitude we prefer in them is one of benevolent\nscepticism. Will you not also try to let the psychoanalytic conception\ndevelop in your mind beside the popular or \"psychiatric\"? They will\ninfluence each other, mutually measure their strength, and some day work\nthemselves into a decision on your part.\nOn the other hand, you must not think for a moment that what I present\nto you as the psychoanalytic conception is a purely speculative system.\nIndeed, it is a sum total of experiences and observations, either their\ndirect expression or their elaboration. Whether this elaboration is done\nadequately and whether the method is justifiable will be tested in the\nfurther progress of the science. After two and a half decades, now that\nI am fairly advanced in years, I may say that it was particularly\ndifficult, intensive and all-absorbing work which yielded these\nobservations. I have often had the impression that our opponents were\nunwilling to take into consideration this objective origin of our\nstatements, as if they thought it were only a question of subjective\nideas arising haphazard, ideas to which another may oppose his every\npassing whim. This antagonistic behavior is not entirely comprehensible\nto me. Perhaps the physician's habit of steering clear of his neurotic\npatients and listening so very casually to what they have to say allows\nhim to lose sight of the possibility of deriving anything valuable from\nhis patients' communications, and therefore, of making penetrating\nobservations on them. I take this opportunity of promising you that I\nshall carry on little controversy in the course of my lectures, least of\nall with individual controversialists. I have never been able to\nconvince myself of the truth of the saying that controversy is the\nfather of all things. I believe that it comes down to us from the Greek\nsophist philosophy and errs as does the latter through the overvaluation\nof dialectics. To me, on the contrary, it seems as if the so-called\nscientific criticism were on the whole unfruitful, quite apart from the\nfact that it is almost always carried on in a most personal spirit. For\nmy part, up to a few years ago, I could even boast that I had entered\ninto a regular scientific dispute with only one scholar (Lowenfeld, of\nMunich). The end of this was that we became friends and have remained\nfriends to this day. But I did not repeat this attempt for a long time,\nbecause I was not certain that the outcome would be the same.\nNow you will surely judge that so to reject the discussion of literature\nmust evidence stubborness, a very special obtuseness against objections,\nor, as the kindly colloquialisms of science have it, \"a complete\npersonal bias.\" In answer, I would say that should you attain to a\nconviction by such hard labor, you would thereby derive a certain right\nto sustain it with some tenacity. Furthermore, I should like to\nemphasize the fact that I have modified my views on certain important\npoints in the course of my researches, changed them and replaced them by\nnew ones, and that I naturally made a public statement of that fact each\ntime. What has been the result of this frankness? Some paid no attention\nat all to my self-corrections and even to-day criticize me for\nassertions which have long since ceased to have the same meaning for me.\nOthers reproach me for just this deviation, and on account of it declare\nme unreliable. For is anyone who has changed his opinions several times\nstill trustworthy; is not his latest assertion, as well, open to error?\nAt the same time he who holds unswervingly to what he has once said, or\ncannot be made to give it up quickly enough, is called stubborn and\nbiased. In the face of these contradictory criticisms, what else can one\ndo but be himself and act according to his own dictates? That is what I\nhave decided to do, and I will not allow myself to be restrained from\nmodifying and adapting my theories as the progress of my experience\ndemands. In the basic ideas I have hitherto found nothing to change, and\nI hope that such will continue to be the case.\nNow I shall present to you the psychoanalytic conception of neurotic\nmanifestations. The natural thing for me to do is to connect them to the\nphenomena we have previously treated, for the sake of their analogy as\nwell as their contrast. I will select as symptomatic an act of frequent\noccurrence in my office hour. Of course, the analyst cannot do much for\nthose who seek him in his medical capacity, and lay the woes of a\nlifetime before him in fifteen minutes. His deeper knowledge makes it\ndifficult for him to deliver a snap decision as do other\nphysicians--\"There is nothing wrong with you\"--and to give the advice,\n\"Go to a watering-place for a while.\" One of our colleagues, in answer\nto the question as to what he did with his office patients, said,\nshrugging his shoulders, that he simply \"fines them so many kronen for\ntheir mischief-making.\" So it will not surprise you to hear that even in\nthe case of very busy analysts, the hours for consultation are not very\ncrowded. I have had the ordinary door between my waiting room and my\noffice doubled and strengthened by a covering of felt. The purpose of\nthis little arrangement cannot be doubted. Now it happens over and over\nagain that people who are admitted from my waiting room omit to close\nthe door behind them; in fact, they almost always leave both doors open.\nAs soon as I have noticed this I insist rather gruffly that he or she go\nback in order to rectify the omission, even though it be an elegant\ngentleman or a lady in all her finery. This gives an impression of\nmisapplied pedantry. I have, in fact, occasionally discredited myself by\nsuch a demand, since the individual concerned was one of those who\ncannot touch even a door knob, and prefer as well to have their\nattendants spared this contact. But most frequently I was right, for he\nwho conducts himself in this way, and leaves the door from the waiting\nroom into the physician's consultation room open, belongs to the rabble\nand deserves to be received inhospitably. Do not, I beg you, defend him\nuntil you have heard what follows. For the fact is that this negligence\nof the patient's only occurs when he has been alone in the waiting room\nand so leaves an empty room behind him, never when others, strangers,\nhave been waiting with him. If that latter is the case, he knows very\nwell that it is in his interest not to be listened to while he is\ntalking to the physician, and never omits to close both the doors with\ncare.\nThis omission of the patient's is so predetermined that it becomes\nneither accidental nor meaningless, indeed, not even unimportant, for,\nas we shall see, it throws light upon the relation of this patient to\nthe physician. He is one of the great number of those who seek\nauthority, who want to be dazzled, intimidated. Perhaps he had inquired\nby telephone as to what time he had best call, he had prepared himself\nto come on a crowd of suppliants somewhat like those in front of a\nbranch milk station. He now enters an empty waiting room which is,\nmoreover, most modestly furnished, and he is disappointed. He must\ndemand reparation from the physician for the wasted respect that he had\ntendered him, and so he omits to close the door between the reception\nroom and the office. By this, he means to say to the physician: \"Oh,\nwell, there is no one here anyway, and probably no one will come as long\nas I am here.\" He would also be quite unmannerly and supercilious during\nthe consultation if his presumption were not at once restrained by a\nsharp reminder.\nYou will find nothing in the analysis of this little symptomatic act\nwhich was not previously known to you. That is to say, it asserts that\nthis act is not accidental, but has a motive, a meaning, a purpose, that\nit has its assignable connections psychologically, and that it serves as\na small indication of a more important psychological process. But above\nall it implies that the process thus intimated is not known to the\nconsciousness of the individual in whom it takes place, for none of the\npatients who left the two doors open would have admitted that they meant\nby this omission to show me their contempt. Some could probably recall a\nslight sense of disappointment at entering an empty waiting room, but\nthe connection between this impression and the symptomatic act which\nfollowed--of these, his consciousness was surely not aware.\nNow let us place, side by side with this small analysis of a symptomatic\nact, an observation on a pathological case. I choose one which is fresh\nin my mind and which can also be described with relative brevity. A\ncertain measure of minuteness of detail is unavoidable in any such\naccount.\nA young officer, home on a short leave of absence, asked me to see his\nmother-in-law who, in spite of the happiest circumstances, was\nembittering her own and her people's existence by a senseless idea. I am\nintroduced to a well preserved lady of fifty-three with pleasant, simple\nmanners, who gives the following account without any hesitation: She is\nmost happily married and lives in the country with her husband, who\noperates a large factory. She cannot say enough for the kind\nthoughtfulness of her husband. They had married for love thirty years\nago, and since then there had never been a shadow, a quarrel or cause\nfor jealousy. Now, even though her two children are well married, the\nhusband and father does not yet want to retire, from a feeling of duty.\nA year ago there happened the incredible thing, incomprehensible to\nherself as well. She gave complete credence to an anonymous letter which\naccused her excellent husband of having an affair with a young girl--and\nsince then her happiness is destroyed. The more detailed circumstances\nwere somewhat as follows: She had a chambermaid with whom she had\nperhaps too often discussed intimate matters. This girl pursued another\nyoung woman with positively malicious enmity because the latter had\nprogressed so much further in life, despite the fact that she was of no\nbetter origin. Instead of going into domestic service, the girl had\nobtained a business training, had entered the factory and in consequence\nof the short-handedness due to the drafting of the clerks into the army\nhad advanced to a good position. She now lives in the factory itself,\nmeets all the gentlemen socially, and is even addressed as \"Miss.\" The\ngirl who had remained behind in life was of course ready to speak all\npossible evil of her one-time schoolmate. One day our patient and her\nchambermaid were talking of an old gentleman who had been visiting at\nthe house, and of whom it was known that he did not live with his wife,\nbut kept another woman as his mistress. She does not know how it\nhappened that she suddenly remarked, \"That would be the most awful thing\nthat could happen to me, if I should ever hear that my good husband also\nhad a mistress.\" The next day she received an anonymous letter through\nthe mail which, in a disguised handwriting, carried this very\ncommunication which she had conjured up. She concluded--it seems\njustifiably--that the letter was the handiwork of her malignant\nchambermaid, for the letter named as the husband's mistress the\nself-same woman whom the maid persecuted with her hatred. Our patient,\nin spite of the fact that she immediately saw through the intrigue and\nhad seen enough in her town to know how little credence such cowardly\ndenunciations deserve, was nevertheless at once prostrated by the\nletter. She became dreadfully excited and promptly sent for her husband\nin order to heap the bitterest reproaches upon him. Her husband\nlaughingly denied the accusation and did the best that could be done. He\ncalled in the family physician, who was as well the doctor in attendance\nat the factory, and the latter added his efforts to quiet the unhappy\nwoman. Their further procedure was also entirely reasonable. The\nchambermaid was dismissed, but the pretended rival was not. Since then,\nthe patient claims she has repeatedly so far calmed herself as no longer\nto believe the contents of the anonymous letter, but this relief was\nneither thoroughgoing nor lasting. It was enough to hear the name of the\nyoung lady spoken or to meet her on the street in order to precipitate a\nnew attack of suspicion, pain and reproach.\nThis, now, is the case history of this good woman. It does not need much\npsychiatric experience to understand that her portrayal of her own case\nwas, if anything, rather too mild in contrast to other nervous patients.\nThe picture, we say, was dissimulated; in reality she had never overcome\nher belief in the accusation of the anonymous letter.\nNow what position does a psychiatrist take toward such a case? We\nalready know what he would do in the case of the symptomatic act of the\npatient who does not close the doors to the waiting room. He declares it\nan accident without psychological interest, with which he need not\nconcern himself. But this attitude cannot be maintained toward the\npathological case of the jealous woman. The symptomatic act seems no\ngreat matter, but the symptom itself claims attention by reason of its\ngravity. It is bound up with intense subjective suffering while\nobjectively it threatens to break up a home; therefore its claim to\npsychiatric interest cannot be put aside. The first endeavor of the\npsychiatrist is to characterize the symptom by some distinctive feature.\nThe idea with which this woman torments herself cannot in itself be\ncalled nonsensical, for it does happen that elderly married men have\naffairs with young girls. But there is something else about it that is\nnonsensical and incredible. The patient has no reason beyond the\ndeclaration in the anonymous letter to believe that her tender and\nfaithful husband belongs to this sort of married men, otherwise not\nuncommon. She knows that this letter in itself carries no proof; she can\nsatisfactorily explain its origin; therefore she ought to be able to\npersuade herself that she has no reason to be jealous. Indeed she does\nthis, but in spite of it she suffers every bit as much as she would if\nshe acknowledged this jealousy as fully justified. We are agreed to call\nideas of this sort, which are inaccessible to arguments based on logic\nor on facts, \"_obsessions_.\" Thus the good lady suffers from an\n\"_obsession of jealousy_\" that is surely a distinctive characterization\nfor this pathological case.\nHaving reached this first certainty, our psychiatric interest will have\nbecome aroused. If we cannot do away with a delusion by taking reality\ninto account, it can hardly have arisen from reality. But the delusion,\nwhat is its origin? There are delusions of the most widely varied\ncontent. Why is it that in our case the content should be jealousy? In\nwhat types of persons are obsessions liable to occur, and, in\nparticular, obsessions of jealousy? We would like to turn to the\npsychiatrist with such questions, but here he leaves us in the lurch.\nThere is only one of our queries which he heeds. He will examine the\nfamily history of this woman and _perhaps_ will give us the answer: \"The\npeople who develop obsessions are those in whose families similar and\nother psychic disturbances have repeatedly occurred.\" In other words, if\nthis lady develops an obsession she does so because she was predisposed\nto it by reason of her heredity. That is certainly something, but is it\nall that we want to know? Is it all that was effective in causing this\nbreakdown? Shall we be content to assume that it is immaterial,\naccidental and inexplicable why the obsession of jealousy develops\nrather than any other? And may we also accept this sentence about the\ndominance of the influence of heredity in its negative meaning, that is,\nthat no matter what experiences came to this human being she was\npredestined to develop some kind of obsession? You will want to know why\nscientific psychiatry will give no further explanation. And I reply, \"He\nis a rascal who gives more than he owns.\" The psychiatrist does not know\nof any path that leads him further in the explanation of such a case. He\nmust content himself with the diagnosis and a prognosis which, despite a\nwealth of experience, is uncertain.\nYet, can psychoanalysis do more at this point? Indeed yes! I hope to\nshow you that even in so inaccessible a case as this it can discover\nsomething which makes the further understanding possible. May I ask you\nfirst to note the apparently insignificant fact that the patient\nactually provoked the anonymous letter which now supports her delusion.\nThe day before, she announces to the intriguing chambermaid that if her\nhusband were to have an affair with a young girl it would be the worst\nmisfortune that could befall her. By so doing she really gave the maid\nthe idea of sending her the anonymous letter. The obsession thus attains\na certain independence from the letter; it existed in the patient\nbeforehand--perhaps as a dread; or was it a wish? Consider, moreover,\nthese additional details yielded by an analysis of only two hours. The\npatient was indeed most helpful when, after telling her story, she was\nurged to communicate her further thoughts, ideas and recollections. She\ndeclared that nothing came to her mind, that she had already told\neverything. After two hours the undertaking had really to be given up\nbecause she announced that she already felt cured and was sure that the\nmorbid idea would not return. Of course, she said this because of this\nresistance and her fear of continuing the analysis. In these two hours,\nhowever, she had let fall certain remarks which made possible definite\ninterpretation, indeed made it incontestable; and this interpretation\nthrows a clear light on the origin of her obsession of jealousy. Namely,\nshe herself was very much infatuated with a certain young man, the very\nsame son-in-law upon whose urging she had come to consult me\nprofessionally. She knew nothing of this infatuation, or at least only a\nvery little. Because of the existing relationship, it was very easy for\nthis infatuation to masquerade under the guise of harmless tenderness.\nWith all our further experience it is not difficult to feel our way\ntoward an understanding of the psychic life of this honest woman and\ngood mother. Such an infatuation, a monstrous, impossible thing, could\nnot be allowed to become conscious. But it continued to exist and\nunconsciously exerted a heavy pressure. Something had to happen, some\nsort of relief had to be found and the mechanism of displacement which\nso constantly takes part in the origin of obsessional jealousy offered\nthe most immediate mitigation. If not only she, old woman that she was,\nwas in love with a young man but if also her old husband had an affair\nwith a young girl, then she would be freed from the voice of her\nconscience which accused her of infidelity. The phantasy of her\nhusband's infidelity was thus like a cooling salve on her burning wound.\nOf her own love she never became conscious, but the reflection of it,\nwhich would bring her such advantages, now became compulsive,\nobsessional and conscious. Naturally all arguments directed against the\nobsession were of no avail since they were directed only to the\nreflection, and not to the original force to which it owed its strength\nand which, unimpeachable, lay buried in the unconscious.\nLet us now piece together these fragments to see what a short and\nimpeded psychoanalysis can nevertheless contribute to the understanding\nof this case. It is assumed of course that our inquiries were carefully\nconducted, a point which I cannot at this place submit to your judgment.\nIn the first place, the obsession becomes no longer nonsensical nor\nincomprehensible, it is full of meaning, well motivated and an integral\npart of the patient's emotional experience. Secondly, it is a necessary\nreaction toward an unconscious psychological process, revealed in other\nways, and it is to this very circumstance that it owes its obsessional\nnature, that is, its resistance to arguments based on logic or fact. In\nitself the obsession is something wished for, a kind of consolation.\nFinally, the experiences underlying the condition are such as\nunmistakably determine an obsession of jealousy and no other. You will\nalso recognize the part played by the two important analogies in the\nanalysis of the symptomatic act with reference to its meaning and intent\nand also to its relation to an unconscious factor in the situation.\nNaturally, we have not yet answered all the questions which may be put\non the basis of this case. Rather the case bristles with further\nproblems of a kind which we have not yet been able to solve in any way,\nand of others which could not be solved because of the disadvantage of\nthe circumstances under which we were working. For example: why is this\nhappily married woman open to an infatuation for her son-in-law, and why\ndoes the relief which could have been obtained in other ways come to her\nby way of this mirror-image, this projection of her own condition upon\nher husband? I trust you will not think that it is idle and wanton to\nopen such problems. Already we have much material at our disposal for\ntheir possible solution. This woman is in that critical age when her\nsexual needs undergo a sudden and unwelcome exaggeration. This might in\nitself be sufficient. In addition, her good and faithful mate may for\nmany years have been lacking in that sufficient sexual capacity which\nthe well-preserved woman needs for her satisfaction. We have learned by\nexperience to know that those very men whose faithfulness is thus placed\nbeyond a doubt are most gentle in their treatment of their wives and\nunusually forbearing toward their nervous complaints. Furthermore, the\nfact that it was just the young husband of a daughter who became the\nobject of her abnormal infatuation is by no means insignificant. A\nstrong erotic attachment to the daughter, which in the last analysis\nleads back to the mother's sexual constitution, will often find a way to\nlive on under such a disguise. May I perhaps remind you in this\nconnection that the relationship between mother and son-in-law has\nseemed particularly delicate since all time and is one which among\nprimitive peoples gave rise to very powerful taboos and avoidances.[37]\nIt often transgresses our cultural standards positively as well as\nnegatively. I cannot tell you of course which of these three factors\nwere at work in our case; whether two of them only, or whether all of\nthem cooperated, for as you know I did not have the opportunity to\ncontinue the analysis beyond two hours.\nI realize at this point, ladies and gentlemen, that I have been speaking\nentirely of things for which your understanding was not prepared. I did\nthis in order to carry through the comparison of psychiatry and\npsychoanalysis. May I now ask one thing of you? Have you noticed any\ncontradiction between them? Psychiatry does not apply the technical\nmethods of psychoanalysis, and neglects to look for any significance in\nthe content of the obsession. Instead of first seeking out more specific\nand immediate causes, psychiatry refers us to the very general and\nremote source--heredity. But does this imply a contradiction, a conflict\nbetween them? Do they not rather supplement one another? For does the\nhereditary factor deny the significance of the experience, is it not\nrather true that both operate together in the most effective way? You\nmust admit that there is nothing in the nature of psychiatric work which\nmust repudiate psychoanalytic research. Therefore, it is the\npsychiatrists who oppose psychoanalysis, not psychiatry itself.\nPsychoanalysis stands in about the same relation to psychiatry as does\nhistology to anatomy. The one studies the outer forms of organs, the\nother the closer structure of tissues and cells. A contradiction between\ntwo types of study, where one simplifies the other, is not easily\nconceivable. You know that anatomy to-day forms the basis of scientific\nmedicine, but there was a time when the dissection of human corpses to\nlearn the inner structure of the body was as much frowned upon as the\npractice of psychoanalysis, which seeks to ascertain the inner workings\nof the human soul, seems proscribed to-day. And presumably a not too\ndistant time will bring us to the realization that a psychiatry which\naspires to scientific depth is not possible without a real knowledge of\nthe deeper unconscious processes in the psychic life.\nPerhaps this much-attacked psychoanalysis has now found some friends\namong you who are anxious to see it justify itself as well from another\naspect, namely, the therapeutic side. You know that the therapy of\npsychiatry has hitherto not been able to influence obsessions. Can\npsychoanalysis perhaps do so, thanks to its insight into the mechanism\nof these symptoms? No, ladies and gentlemen, it cannot; for the present\nat least it is just as powerless in the face of these maladies as every\nother therapy. We can understand what it was that happened within the\npatient, but we have no means of making the patient himself understand\nthis. In fact, I told you that I could not extend the analysis of the\nobsession beyond the first steps. Would you therefore assert that\nanalysis is objectionable in such cases because it remains without\nresult? I think not. We have the right, indeed we have the duty to\npursue scientific research without regard to an immediate practical\neffect. Some day, though we do not know when or where, every little\nscrap of knowledge will have been translated into skill, even into\ntherapeutic skill. If psychoanalysis were as unsuccessful in all other\nforms of nervous and psychological disease as it is in the case of the\nobsession, it would nevertheless remain fully justified as an\nirreplaceable method of scientific research. It is true that we would\nthen not be in a position to practice it, for the human subjects from\nwhich we must learn, live and will in their own right; they must have\nmotives of their own in order to assist in the work, but they would deny\nthemselves to us. Therefore let me conclude this session by telling you\nthat there are comprehensive groups of nervous diseases concerning which\nour better understanding has actually been translated into therapeutic\npower; moreover, that in disturbances which are most difficult to reach\nwe can under certain conditions secure results which are second to none\nin the field of internal therapeutics.\nSEVENTEENTH LECTURE\nGENERAL THEORY OF THE NEUROSES\n_The Meaning of the Symptoms_\nIn the last lecture I explained to you that clinical psychiatry concerns\nitself very little with the form under which the symptoms appear or with\nthe burden they carry, but that it is precisely here that psychoanalysis\nsteps in and shows that the symptom carries a meaning and is connected\nwith the experience of the patient. The meaning of neurotic symptoms was\nfirst discovered by J. Breuer in the study and felicitous cure of a case\nof hysteria which has since become famous (1880-82). It is true that P.\nJanet independently reached the same result; literary priority must in\nfact be accorded to the French scholar, since Breuer published his\nobservations more than a decade later (1893-95) during his period of\ncollaboration with me. On the whole it may be of small importance to us\nwho is responsible for this discovery, for you know that every discovery\nis made more than once, that none is made all at once, and that success\nis not meted out according to deserts. America is not named after\nColumbus. Before Breuer and Janet, the great psychiatrist Leuret\nexpressed the opinion that even for the deliria of the insane, if we\nonly understood how to interpret them, a meaning could be found. I\nconfess that for a considerable period of time I was willing to estimate\nvery highly the credit due to P. Janet in the explanation of neurotic\nsymptoms, because he saw in them the expression of subconscious ideas\n(_idees inconscientes_) with which the patients were obsessed. But since\nthen Janet has expressed himself most conservatively, as though he\nwanted to confess that the term \"subconscious\" had been for him nothing\nmore than a mode of speech, a shift, \"_une facon de parler_,\" by the use\nof which he had nothing definite in mind. I now no longer understand\nJanet's discussions, but I believe that he has needlessly deprived\nhimself of high credit.\nThe neurotic symptoms then have their meaning just like errors and the\ndream, and like these they are related to the lives of the persons in\nwhom they appear. The importance of this insight into the nature of the\nsymptom can best be brought home to you by way of examples. That it is\nborne out always and in all cases, I can only assert, not prove. He who\ngathers his own experience will be convinced of it. For certain reasons,\nhowever, I shall draw my instances not from hysteria, but from another\nfundamentally related and very curious neurosis concerning which I wish\nto say a few introductory words to you. This so-called compulsion\nneurosis is not so popular as the widely known hysteria; it is, if I may\nuse the expression, not so noisily ostentatious, behaves more as a\nprivate concern of the patient, renounces bodily manifestations almost\nentirely and creates all its symptoms psychologically. Compulsion\nneurosis and hysteria are those forms of neurotic disease by the study\nof which psychoanalysis has been built up, and in whose treatment as\nwell the therapy celebrates its triumphs. Of these the compulsion\nneurosis, which does not take that mysterious leap from the psychic to\nthe physical, has through psychoanalytic research become more intimately\ncomprehensible and transparent to us than hysteria, and we have come to\nunderstand that it reveals far more vividly certain extreme\ncharacteristics of the neuroses.\nThe chief manifestations of compulsion neurosis are these: the patient\nis occupied by thoughts that in reality do not interest him, is moved by\nimpulses that appear alien to him, and is impelled to actions which, to\nbe sure, afford him no pleasure, but the performance of which he cannot\npossibly resist. The thoughts may be absurd in themselves or thoroughly\nindifferent to the individual, often they are absolutely childish and in\nall cases they are the result of strained thinking, which exhausts the\npatient, who surrenders himself to them most unwillingly. Against his\nwill he is forced to brood and speculate as though it were a matter of\nlife or death to him. The impulses, which the patient feels within\nhimself, may also give a childish or ridiculous impression, but for the\nmost part they bear the terrifying aspect of temptations to fearful\ncrimes, so that the patient not only denies them, but flees from them in\nhorror and protects himself from actual execution of his desires through\ninhibitory renunciations and restrictions upon his personal liberty. As\na matter of fact he never, not a single time, carries any of these\nimpulses into effect; the result is always that his evasion and\nprecaution triumph. The patient really carries out only very harmless\ntrivial acts, so-called compulsive acts, for the most part repetitions\nand ceremonious additions to the occupations of every-day life, through\nwhich its necessary performances--going to bed, washing, dressing,\nwalking--become long-winded problems of almost insuperable difficulty.\nThe abnormal ideas, impulses and actions are in nowise equally potent in\nindividual forms and cases of compulsion neurosis; it is the rule,\nrather, that one or the other of these manifestations is the dominating\nfactor and gives the name to the disease; that all these forms, however,\nhave a great deal in common is quite undeniable.\nSurely this means violent suffering. I believe that the wildest\npsychiatric phantasy could not have succeeded in deriving anything\ncomparable, and if one did not actually see it every day, one could\nhardly bring oneself to believe it. Do not think, however, that you give\nthe patient any help when you coax him to divert himself, to put aside\nthese stupid ideas and to set himself to something useful in the place\nof his whimsical occupations. This is just what he would like of his own\naccord, for he possesses all his senses, shares your opinion of his\ncompulsion symptoms, in fact volunteers it quite readily. But he cannot\ndo otherwise; whatever activities actually are released under compulsion\nneurosis are carried along by a driving energy, such as is probably\nnever met with in normal psychic life. He has only one remedy--to\ntransfer and change. In place of one stupid idea he can think of a\nsomewhat milder absurdity, he can proceed from one precaution and\nprohibition to another, or carry through another ceremonial. He may\nshift, but he cannot annul the compulsion. One of the chief\ncharacteristics of the sickness is the instability of the symptoms; they\ncan be shifted very far from their original form. It is moreover\nstriking that the contrasts present in all psychological experience are\nso very sharply drawn in this condition. In addition to the compulsion\nof positive and negative content, an intellectual doubt makes itself\nfelt that gradually attacks the most ordinary and assured certainties.\nAll these things merge into steadily increasing uncertainty, lack of\nenergy, curtailment of personal liberty, despite the fact that the\npatient suffering from compulsion neurosis is originally a most\nenergetic character, often of extraordinary obstinacy, as a rule\nintellectually gifted above the average. For the most part he has\nattained a desirable stage of ethical development, is overconscientious\nand more than usually correct. You can imagine that it takes no\ninconsiderable piece of work to find one's way through this maze of\ncontradictory characteristics and symptoms. Indeed, for the present our\nonly object is to understand and to interpret some symptoms of this\ndisease.\nPerhaps in reference to our previous discussions, you would like to know\nthe position of present-day psychiatry to the problems of the compulsion\nneurosis. This is covered in a very slim chapter. Psychiatry gives names\nto the various forms of compulsion, but says nothing further concerning\nthem. Instead it emphasizes the fact that those who show these symptoms\nare degenerates. That yields slight satisfaction, it is an ethical\njudgment, a condemnation rather than an explanation. We are led to\nsuppose that it is in the unsound that all these peculiarities may be\nfound. Now we do believe that persons who develop such symptoms must\ndiffer fundamentally from other people. But we would like to ask, are\nthey more \"degenerate\" than other nervous patients, those suffering, for\ninstance, from hysteria or other diseases of the mind? The\ncharacterization is obviously too general. One may even doubt whether it\nis at all justified, when one learns that such symptoms occur in\nexcellent men and women of especially great and universally recognized\nability. In general we glean very little intimate knowledge of the great\nmen who serve us as models. This is due both to their own discretion and\nto the lying propensities of their biographers. Sometimes, however, a\nman is a fanatic disciple of truth, such as Emile Zola, and then we hear\nfrom him the strange compulsion habits from which he suffered all his\nlife.[38]\nPsychiatry has resorted to the expedient of speaking of \"superior\ndegenerates.\" Very well--but through psychoanalysis we have learned that\nthese peculiar compulsion symptoms may be permanently removed just like\nany other disease of normal persons. I myself have frequently succeeded\nin doing this.\nI will give you two examples only of the analysis of compulsion\nsymptoms, one, an old observation, which cannot be replaced by anything\nmore complete, and one a recent study. I am limiting myself to such a\nsmall number because in an account of this nature it is necessary to be\nvery explicit and to enter into every detail.\nA lady about thirty years old suffered from the most severe compulsions.\nI might indeed have helped her if caprice of fortune had not destroyed\nmy work--perhaps I will yet have occasion to tell you about it. In the\ncourse of each day the patient often executed, among others, the\nfollowing strange compulsive act. She ran from her room into an\nadjoining one, placed herself in a definite spot beside a table which\nstood in the middle of the room, rang for her maid, gave her a trivial\nerrand to do, or dismissed her without more ado, and then ran back\nagain. This was certainly not a severe symptom of disease, but it still\ndeserved to arouse curiosity. Its explanation was found, absolutely\nwithout any assistance on the part of the physician, in the very\nsimplest way, a way to which no one can take exception. I hardly know\nhow I alone could have guessed the meaning of this compulsive act, or\nhave found any suggestion toward its interpretation. As often as I had\nasked the patient: \"Why do you do this? Of what use is it?\" she had\nanswered, \"I don't know.\" But one day after I had succeeded in\nsurmounting a grave ethical doubt of hers she suddenly saw the light and\nrelated the history of the compulsive act. More than ten years prior she\nhad married a man far older than herself, who had proved impotent on the\nbridal night. Countless times during the night he had run from his room\nto hers to repeat the attempt, but each time without success. In the\nmorning he said angrily: \"It is enough to make one ashamed before the\nmaid who does the beds,\" and took a bottle of red ink that happened to\nbe in the room, and poured its contents on the sheet, but not on the\nplace where such a stain would have been justifiable. At first I did not\nunderstand the connection between this reminiscence and the compulsive\nact in question, for the only agreement I could find between them was in\nthe running from one room into another,--possibly also in the appearance\nof the maid. Then the patient led me to the table in the second room and\nlet me discover a large spot on the cover. She explained also that she\nplaced herself at the table in such a way that the maid could not miss\nseeing the stain. Now it was no longer possible to doubt the intimate\nrelation of the scene after her bridal night and her present compulsive\nact, but there were still a number of things to be learned about it.\nIn the first place, it is obvious that the patient identifies herself\nwith her husband, she is acting his part in her imitation of his running\nfrom one room into the other. We must then admit--if she holds to this\nrole--that she replaces the bed and sheet by table and cover. This may\nseem arbitrary, but we have not studied dream symbolism in vain. In\ndreams also a table which must be interpreted as a bed, is frequently\nseen. \"Bed and board\" together represent married life, one may therefore\neasily be used to represent the other.\nThe evidence that the compulsive act carries meaning would thus be\nplain; it appears as a representation, a repetition of the original\nsignificant scene. However, we are not forced to stop at this semblance\nof a solution; when we examine more closely the relation between these\ntwo people, we shall probably be enlightened concerning something of\nwider importance, namely, the purpose of the compulsive act. The nucleus\nof this purpose is evidently the summoning of the maid; to her she\nwishes to show the stain and refute her husband's remark: \"It is enough\nto shame one before the maid.\" He--whose part she is playing--therefore\nfeels no shame before the maid, hence the stain must be in the right\nplace. So we see that she has not merely repeated the scene, rather she\nhas amplified it, corrected it and \"turned it to the good.\" Thereby,\nhowever, she also corrects something else,--the thing which was so\nembarrassing that night and necessitated the use of the red\nink--impotence. The compulsive act then says: \"No, it is not true, he\ndid not have to be ashamed before the maid, he was not impotent.\" After\nthe manner of a dream she represents the fulfillment of this wish in an\novert action, she is ruled by the desire to help her husband over that\nunfortunate incident.\nEverything else that I could tell you about this case supports this clue\nmore specifically; all that we otherwise know about her tends to\nstrengthen this interpretation of a compulsive act incomprehensible in\nitself. For years the woman has lived separated from her husband and is\nstruggling with the intention to obtain a legal divorce. But she is by\nno means free from him; she forces herself to remain faithful to him,\nshe retires from the world to avoid temptation; in her imagination she\nexcuses and idealizes him. The deepest secret of her malady is that by\nmeans of it she shields her husband from malicious gossip, justifies her\nseparation from him, and renders possible for him a comfortable separate\nlife. Thus the analysis of a harmless compulsive act leads to the very\nheart of this case and at the same time reveals no inconsiderable\nportion of the secret of the compulsion neurosis in general. I shall be\nglad to have you dwell upon this instance, as it combines conditions\nthat one can scarcely demand in other cases. The interpretation of the\nsymptoms was discovered by the patient herself in one flash, without the\nsuggestion or interference of the analyst. It came about by the\nreference to an experience, which did not, as is usually the case,\nbelong to the half-forgotten period of childhood, but to the mature life\nof the patient, in whose memory it had remained unobliterated. All the\nobjections which critics ordinarily offer to our interpretation of\nsymptoms fail in this case. Of course, we are not always so fortunate.\nAnd one thing more! Have you not observed how this insignificant\ncompulsive act initiated us into the intimate life of the invalid? A\nwoman can scarcely relate anything more intimate than the story of her\nbridal night, and is it without further significance that we just\nhappened to come on the intimacies of her sexual life? It might of\ncourse be the result of the selection I have made in this instance. Let\nus not judge too quickly and turn our attention to the second instance,\none of an entirely different kind, a sample of a frequently occurring\nvariety, namely, the sleep ritual.\nA nineteen-year old, well-developed, gifted girl, an only child, who was\nsuperior to her parents in education and intellectual activity, had been\nwild and mischievous in her childhood, but has become very nervous\nduring the last years without any apparent outward cause. She is\nespecially irritable with her mother, always discontented, depressed,\nhas a tendency toward indecision and doubt, and is finally forced to\nconfess that she can no longer walk alone on public squares or wide\nthoroughfares. We shall not consider at length her complicated\ncondition, which requires at least two diagnoses--agoraphobia and\ncompulsion neurosis. We will dwell only upon the fact that this girl has\nalso developed a sleep ritual, under which she allows her parents to\nsuffer much discomfort. In a certain sense, we may say that every\nnormal person has a sleep ritual, in other words that he insists on\ncertain conditions, the absence of which hinders him from falling\nasleep; he has created certain observances by which he bridges the\ntransition from waking to sleeping and these he repeats every evening in\nthe same manner. But everything that the healthy person demands in order\nto obtain sleep is easily understandable and, above all, when external\nconditions necessitate a change, he adapts himself easily and without\nloss of time. But the pathological ritual is rigid, it persists by\nvirtue of the greatest sacrifices, it also masks itself with a\nreasonable justification and seems, in the light of superficial\nobservation, to differ from the normal only by exaggerated pedantry. But\nunder closer observation we notice that the mask is transparent, for the\nritual covers intentions that go far beyond this reasonable\njustification, and other intentions as well that are in direct\ncontradiction to this reasonable justification. Our patient cites as the\nmotive of her nightly precautions that she must have quiet in order to\nsleep; therefore she excludes all sources of noise. To accomplish this,\nshe does two things: the large clock in her room is stopped, all other\nclocks are removed; not even the wrist watch on her night-table is\nsuffered to remain. Flowerpots and vases are placed on her desk so that\nthey cannot fall down during the night, and in breaking disturb her\nsleep. She knows that these precautions are scarcely justifiable for the\nsake of quiet; the ticking of the small watch could not be heard even if\nit should remain on the night-table, and moreover we all know that the\nregular ticking of a clock is conducive to sleep rather than disturbing.\nShe does admit that there is not the least probability that flowerpots\nand vases left in place might of their own accord fall and break during\nthe night. She drops the pretense of quiet for the other practice of\nthis sleep ritual. She seems on the contrary to release a source of\ndisturbing noises by the demand that the door between her own room and\nthat of her parents remain half open, and she insures this condition by\nplacing various objects in front of the open door. The most important\nobservances concern the bed itself. The large pillow at the head of the\nbed may not touch the wooden back of the bed. The small pillow for her\nhead must lie on the large pillow to form a rhomb; she then places her\nhead exactly upon the diagonal of the rhomb. Before covering herself,\nthe featherbed must be shaken so that its foot end becomes quite flat,\nbut she never omits to press this down and redistribute the thickness.\nAllow me to pass over the other trivial incidents of this ritual; they\nwould teach us nothing new and cause too great digression from our\npurpose. Do not overlook, however, the fact that all this does not run\nits course quite smoothly. Everything is pervaded by the anxiety that\nthings have not been done properly; they must be examined, repeated. Her\ndoubts seize first on one, then on another precaution, and the result is\nthat one or two hours elapse during which the girl cannot and the\nintimidated parents dare not sleep.\nThese torments were not so easily analyzed as the compulsive act of our\nformer patient. In the working out of the interpretations I had to hint\nand suggest to the girl, and was met on her part either by positive\ndenial or mocking doubt. This first reaction of denial, however, was\nfollowed by a time when she occupied herself of her own accord with the\npossibilities that had been suggested, noted the associations they\ncalled out, produced reminiscences, and established connections, until\nthrough her own efforts she had reached and accepted all\ninterpretations. In so far as she did this, she desisted as well from\nthe performance of her compulsive rules, and even before the treatment\nhad ended she had given up the entire ritual. You must also know that\nthe nature of present-day analysis by no means enables us to follow out\neach individual symptom until its meaning becomes clear. Rather it is\nnecessary to abandon a given theme again and again, yet with the\ncertainty that we will be led back to it in some other connection. The\ninterpretation of the symptoms in this case, which I am about to give\nyou, is a synthesis of results, which, with the interruptions of other\nwork, needed weeks and months for their compilation.\nOur patient gradually learns to understand that she has banished clocks\nand watches from her room during the night because the clock is the\nsymbol of the female genital. The clock, which we have learned to\ninterpret as a symbol for other things also, receives this role of the\ngenital organ through its relation to periodic occurrences at equal\nintervals. A woman may for instance be found to boast that her\nmenstruation is as regular as clockwork. The special fear of our\npatient, however, was that the ticking of the clock would disturb her\nin her sleep. The ticking of the clock may be compared to the throbbing\nof the clitoris during sexual excitement. Frequently she had actually\nbeen awakened by this painful sensation and now this fear of an erection\nof the clitoris caused her to remove all ticking clocks during the\nnight. Flowerpots and vases are, as are all vessels, also female\nsymbols. The precaution, therefore, that they should not fall and break\nat night, was not without meaning. We know the widespread custom of\nbreaking a plate or dish when an engagement is celebrated. The fragment\nof which each guest possesses himself symbolizes his renunciation of his\nclaim to the bride, a renunciation which we may assume as based on the\nmonogamous marriage law. Furthermore, to this part of her ceremonial our\npatient adds a reminiscence and several associations. As a child she had\nslipped once and fallen with a bowl of glass or clay, had cut her\nfinger, and bled violently. As she grew up and learned the facts of\nsexual intercourse, she developed the fear that she might not bleed\nduring her bridal night and so not prove to be a virgin. Her precaution\nagainst the breaking of vases was a rejection of the entire virginity\ncomplex, including the bleeding connected with the first cohabitation.\nShe rejected both the fear to bleed and the contradictory fear not to\nbleed. Indeed her precautions had very little to do with a prevention of\nnoise.\nOne day she guessed the central idea of her ceremonial, when she\nsuddenly understood her rule not to let the pillow come in contact with\nthe bed. The pillows always had seemed a woman to her, the erect back of\nthe bed a man. By means of magic, we may say, she wished to keep apart\nman and wife; it was her parents she wished to separate, so to prevent\ntheir marital intercourse. She had sought to attain the same end by more\ndirect methods in earlier years, before the institution of her\nceremonial. She had simulated fear or exploited a genuine timidity in\norder to keep open the door between the parents' bedroom and the\nnursery. This demand had been retained in her present ceremonial. Thus\nshe had gained the opportunity of overhearing her parents, a proceeding\nwhich at one time subjected her to months of sleeplessness. Not content\nwith this disturbance to her parents, she was at that time occasionally\nable to gain her point and sleep between father and mother in their\nvery bed. Then \"pillow\" and \"wooden wall\" could really not come in\ncontact. Finally when she became so big that her presence between the\nparents could not longer be borne comfortably, she consciously simulated\nfear and actually succeeded in changing places with her mother and\ntaking her place at her father's side. This situation was undoubtedly\nthe starting point for the phantasies, whose after-effects made\nthemselves felt in her ritual.\nIf a pillow represented a woman, then the shaking of the featherbed till\nall the feathers were lumped at one end, rounding it into a prominence,\nmust have its meaning also. It meant the impregnation of the wife; the\nceremonial, however, never failed to provide for the annulment, of this\npregnancy by the flattening down of the feathers. Indeed, for years our\npatient had feared that the intercourse between her parents might result\nin another child which would be her rival. Now, where the large pillow\nrepresents a woman, the mother, then the small pillow could be nothing\nbut the daughter. Why did this pillow have to be placed so as to form a\nrhomb; and why did the girl's head have to rest exactly upon the\ndiagonal? It was easy to remind the patient that the rhomb on all walls\nis the rune used to represent the open female genital. She herself then\nplayed the part of the man, the father, and her head took the place of\nthe male organ. (Cf. the symbol of beheading to represent castration.)\nWild ideas, you will say, to run riot in the head of a virgin girl. I\nadmit it, but do not forget that I have not created these ideas but\nmerely interpreted them. A sleep ritual of this kind is itself very\nstrange, and you cannot deny the correspondence between the ritual and\nthe phantasies that yielded us the interpretation. For my part I am most\nanxious that you observe in this connection that no single phantasy was\nprojected in the ceremonial, but a number of them had to be\nintegrated,--they must have their nodal points somewhere in space.\nObserve also that the observance of the ritual reproduce the sexual\ndesire now positively, now negatively, and serve in part as their\nrejection, again as their representation.\nIt would be possible to make a better analysis of this ritual by\nrelating it to other symptoms of the patient. But we cannot digress in\nthat direction. Let the suggestion suffice that the girl is subject to\nan erotic attachment to her father, the beginning of which goes back to\nher earliest childhood. That perhaps is the reason for her unfriendly\nattitude toward her mother. Also we cannot escape the fact that the\nanalysis of this symptom again points to the sexual life of the patient.\nThe more we penetrate to the meaning and purpose of neurotic symptoms,\nthe less surprising will this seem to us.\nBy means of two selected illustrations I have demonstrated to you that\nneurotic symptoms carry just as much meaning as do errors and the dream,\nand that they are intimately connected with the experience of the\npatient. Can I expect you to believe this vitally significant statement\non the strength of two examples? No. But can you expect me to cite\nfurther illustrations until you declare yourself convinced? That too is\nimpossible, since considering the explicitness with which I treat each\nindividual case, I would require a five-hour full semester course for\nthe explanation of this one point in the theory of the neuroses. I must\ncontent myself then with having given you one proof for my assertion and\nrefer you for the rest to the literature of the subject, above all to\nthe classical interpretation of symptoms in Breuer's first case\n(hysteria) as well as to the striking clarification of obscure symptoms\nin the so-called dementia praecox by C. G. Jung, dating from the time\nwhen this scholar was still content to be a mere psychoanalyst--and did\nnot yet want to be a prophet; and to all the articles that have\nsubsequently appeared in our periodicals. It is precisely investigations\nof this sort which are plentiful. Psychoanalysts have felt themselves so\nmuch attracted by the analysis, interpretation and translation of\nneurotic symptoms, that by contrast they seem temporarily to have\nneglected other problems of neurosis.\nWhoever among you takes the trouble to look into the matter will\nundoubtedly be deeply impressed by the wealth of evidential material.\nBut he will also encounter difficulties. We have learned that the\nmeaning of a symptom is found in its relation to the experience of the\npatient. The more highly individualized the symptom is, the sooner we\nmay hope to establish these relations. Therefore the task resolves\nitself specifically into the discovery for every nonsensical idea and\nuseless action of a past situation wherein the idea had been justified\nand the action purposeful. A perfect example for this kind of symptom is\nthe compulsive act of our patient who ran to the table and rang for the\nmaid. But there are symptoms of a very different nature which are by no\nmeans rare. They must be called typical symptoms of the disease, for\nthey are approximately alike in all cases, in which the individual\ndifferences disappear or shrivel to such an extent that it is difficult\nto connect them with the specific experiences of the patient and to\nrelate them to the particular situations of his past. Let us again\ndirect our attention to the compulsion neurosis. The sleep ritual of our\nsecond patient is already quite typical, but bears enough individual\nfeatures to render possible what may be called an _historic_\ninterpretation. But all compulsive patients tend to repeat, to isolate\ntheir actions from others and to subject them to a rhythmic sequence.\nMost of them wash too much. Agoraphobia (topophobia, fear of spaces), a\nmalady which is no longer grouped with the compulsion neurosis, but is\nnow called anxiety hysteria, invariably shows the same pathological\npicture; it repeats with exhausting monotony the same feature, the\npatient's fear of closed spaces, of large open squares, of long\nstretched streets and parkways, and their feeling of safety when\nacquaintances accompany them, when a carriage drives after them, etc. On\nthis identical groundwork, however, the individual differences between\nthe patients are superimposed--moods one might almost call them, which\nare sharply contrasted in the various cases. The one fears only narrow\nstreets, the other only wide ones, the one can go out walking only when\nthere are few people abroad, the other when there are many. Hysteria\nalso, aside from its wealth of individual features, has a superfluity of\ncommon typical symptoms that appear to resist any facile historical\nmethods of tracing them. But do not let us forget that it is by these\ntypical symptoms that we get our bearings in reaching a diagnosis. When,\nin one case of hysteria we have finally traced back a typical symptom to\nan experience or a series of similar experiences, for instance followed\nback an hysterical vomiting to its origin in a succession of disgust\nimpressions, another case of vomiting will confuse us by revealing an\nentirely different chain of experiences, seemingly just as effective. It\nseems almost as though hysterical patients must vomit for some reason as\nyet unknown, and that the historic factors, revealed by analysis, are\nchance pretexts, seized on as opportunity best offered to serve the\npurposes of a deeper need.\nThus we soon reach the discouraging conclusion that although we can\nsatisfactorily explain the individual neurotic symptom by relating it to\nan experience, our science fails us when it comes to the typical\nsymptoms that occur far more frequently. In addition, remember that I am\nnot going into all the detailed difficulties which come up in the course\nof resolutely hunting down an historic interpretation of the symptom. I\nhave no intention of doing this, for though I want to keep nothing from\nyou, and so paint everything in its true colors, I still do not wish to\nconfuse and discourage you at the very outset of our studies. It is true\nthat we have only begun to understand the interpretation of symptoms,\nbut we wish to hold fast to the results we have achieved, and struggle\nforward step by step toward the mastery of the still unintelligible\ndata. I therefore try to cheer you with the thought that a fundamental\nbetween the two kinds of symptoms can scarcely be assumed. Since the\nindividual symptoms are so obviously dependent upon the experience of\nthe patient, there is a possibility that the typical symptoms revert to\nan experience that is in itself typical and common to all humanity.\nOther regularly recurring features of neurosis, such as the repetition\nand doubt of the compulsion neurosis, may be universal reactions which\nare forced upon the patient by the very nature of the abnormal change.\nIn short, we have no reason to be prematurely discouraged; we shall see\nwhat our further results will yield.\nWe meet a very similar difficulty in the theory of dreams, which in our\nprevious discussion of the dream I could not go into. The manifest\ncontent of dreams is most profuse and individually varied, and I have\nshown very explicitly what analysis may glean from this content. But\nside by side with these dreams there are others which may also be termed\n\"typical\" and which occur similarly in all people. These are dreams of\nidentical content which offer the same difficulties for their\ninterpretation as the typical symptom. They are the dreams of falling,\nflying, floating, swimming, of being hemmed in, of nakedness, and\nvarious other anxiety dreams that yield first one and then another\ninterpretation for the different patients, without resulting in an\nexplanation of their monotonous and typical recurrence. In the matter\nof these dreams also, we see a fundamental groundwork enriched by\nindividual additions. Probably they as well can be fitted into the\ntheory of dream life, built up on the basis of other dreams,--not\nhowever by straining the point, but by the gradual broadening of our\nviews.\nEIGHTEENTH LECTURE\nGENERAL THEORY OF THE NEUROSES\n_Traumatic Fixation--The Unconscious_\nI said last time that we would not continue our work from the standpoint\nof our doubts, but on the basis of our results. We have not even touched\nupon two of the most interesting conclusions, derived equally from the\nsame two sample analyses.\nIn the first place, both patients give us the impression of being\n_fixated_ upon some very definite part of their past; they are unable to\nfree themselves therefrom, and have therefore come to be completely\nestranged both from the present and the future. They are now isolated in\ntheir ailment, just as in earlier days people withdrew into monasteries\nthere to carry along the burden of their unhappy fates. In the case of\nthe first patient, it is her marriage with her husband, really\nabandoned, that has determined her lot. By means of her symptoms she\ncontinues to deal with her husband; we have learned to understand those\nvoices which plead his case, which excuse him, exalt him, lament his\nloss. Although she is young and might be coveted by other men, she has\nseized upon all manner of real and imaginary (magic) precautions to\nsafeguard her virtue for him. She will not appear before strangers, she\nneglects her personal appearance; furthermore, she cannot bring herself\nto get up readily from any chair on which she has been seated. She\nrefuses to give her signature, and finally, since she is motivated by\nher desire not to let anyone have anything of hers, she is unable to\ngive presents.\nIn the case of the second patient, the young girl, it is an erotic\nattachment for her father that had established itself in the years prior\nto puberty, which plays the same role in her life. She also has arrived\nat the conclusion that she may not marry so long as she is sick. We may\nsuspect she became ill in order that she need not marry, and that she\nmight stay with her father.\nIt is impossible to evade the question of how, in what manner, and\ndriven by what motives, an individual may come by such a remarkable and\nunprofitable attitude toward life. Granted of course that this bearing\nis a general characteristic of neurosis, and not a special peculiarity\nof these two cases, it is nevertheless a general trait in every neurosis\nof very great importance in practice. Breuer's first hysterical patient\nwas fixated in the same manner upon the time when she nursed her very\nsick father. In spite of her recuperation she has, in certain respects,\nsince that time, been done with life; although she remained healthy and\nable, she did not enter on the normal life of women. In every one of our\npatients we may see, by the use of analysis, that in his\ndisease-symptoms and their results he has gone back again into a\ndefinite period of his past. In the majority of cases he even chooses a\nvery early phase of his life, sometime a childhood phase, indeed,\nlaughable as it may appear, a phase of his very suckling existence.\nThe closest analogies to these conditions of our neurotics are furnished\nby the types of sickness which the war has just now made so\nfrequent--the so-called traumatic neuroses. Even before the war there\nwere such cases after railroad collisions and other frightful\noccurrences which endangered life. The traumatic neuroses are,\nfundamentally, not the same as the spontaneous neuroses which we have\nbeen analysing and treating; moreover, we have not yet succeeded in\nbringing them within our hypotheses, and I hope to be able to make clear\nto you wherein this limitation lies. Yet on one point we may emphasize\nthe existence of a complete agreement between the two forms. The\ntraumatic neuroses show clear indications that they are grounded in a\nfixation upon the moment of the traumatic disaster. In their dreams\nthese patients regularly live over the traumatic situation; where there\nare attacks of an hysterical type, which permit of an analysis, we learn\nthat the attack approximates a complete transposition into this\nsituation. It is as if these patients had not yet gotten through with\nthe traumatic situation, as if it were actually before them as a task\nwhich was not yet mastered. We take this view of the matter in all\nseriousness; it shows the way to an _economic_ view of psychic\noccurrences. For the expression \"traumatic\" has no other than an\neconomic meaning, and the disturbance permanently attacks the\nmanagement of available energy. The traumatic experience is one which,\nin a very short space of time, is able to increase the strength of a\ngiven stimulus so enormously that its assimilation, or rather its\nelaboration, can no longer be effected by normal means.\nThis analogy tempts us to classify as traumatic those experiences as\nwell upon which our neurotics appear to be fixated. Thus the possibility\nis held out to us of having found a simple determining factor for the\nneurosis. It would then be comparable to a traumatic disease, and would\narise from the inability to meet an overpowering emotional experience.\nAs a matter of fact this reads like the first formula, by which Breuer\nand I, in 1893-1895, accounted theoretically for our new observations. A\ncase such as that of our first patient, the young woman separated from\nher husband, is very well explained by this conception. She was not able\nto get over the unfeasibility of her marriage, and has not been able to\nextricate herself from this trauma. But our very next, that of the girl\nattached to her father, shows us that the formula is not sufficiently\ncomprehensive. On the one hand, such baby love of a little girl for her\nfather is so usual, and so often outlived that the designation\n\"traumatic\" would carry no significance; on the other hand, the history\nof the patient teaches us that this first erotic fixation apparently\npassed by harmlessly at the time, and did not again appear until many\nyears later in the symptoms of the compulsion neurosis. We see\ncomplications before us, the existence of a greater wealth of\ndetermining factors in the disease, but we also suspect that the\ntraumatic viewpoint will not have to be given up as wrong; rather it\nwill have to subordinate itself when it is fitted into a different\ncontext.\nHere again we must leave the road we have been traveling. For the time\nbeing, it leads us no further and we have many other things to find out\nbefore we can go on again. But before we leave this subject let us note\nthat the fixation on some particular phase of the past has bearings\nwhich extend far beyond the neurosis. Every neurosis contains such a\nfixation, but every fixation does not lead to a neurosis, nor fall into\nthe same class with neuroses, nor even set the conditions for the\ndevelopment of a neurosis. Mourning is a type of emotional fixation on a\ntheory of the past, which also brings with it the most complete\nalienation from the present and the future. But mourning is sharply\ndistinguished from neuroses that may be designated as pathological forms\nof mourning.\nIt also happens that men are brought to complete deadlock by a traumatic\nexperience that has so completely shaken the foundations on which they\nhave built their lives that they give up all interest in the present and\nfuture, and become completely absorbed in their retrospections; but\nthese unhappy persons are not necessarily neurotic. We must not\noverestimate this one feature as a diagnostic for a neurosis, no matter\nhow invariable and potent it may be.\nNow let us turn to the second conclusion of our analysis, which however\nwe will hardly need to limit subsequently. We have spoken of the\nsenseless compulsive activities of our first patient, and what intimate\nmemories she disclosed as belonging to them; later we also investigated\nthe connection between experience and symptom and thus discovered the\npurpose hidden behind the compulsive activity. But we have entirely\nomitted one factor that deserves our whole attention. As long as the\npatient kept repeating the compulsive activity she did not know that it\nwas in any way related with the experience in question. The connection\nbetween the two was hidden from her, she truthfully answered that she\ndid not know what compelled her to do this. Once, suddenly, under the\ninfluence of the cure, she hit upon the connection and was able to tell\nit to us. But still she did not know of the end in the service of which\nshe performed the compulsive activities, the purpose to correct a\npainful part of the past and to place the husband, still loved by her,\nupon a higher level. It took quite a long time and a great deal of\ntrouble for her to grasp and admit to me that such a motive alone could\nhave been the motive force of the compulsive activity.\nThe relation between the scene after the unhappy bridal night and the\ntender motive of the patient yield what we have called the meaning of\nthe compulsive activity. But both the \"whence\" and the \"why\" remained\nhidden from her as long as she continued to carry out the compulsive\nact. Psychological processes had been going on within her for which the\ncompulsive act found an expression. She could, in a normal frame of\nmind, observe their effect, but none of the psychological antecedents\nof her action had come to the knowledge of her consciousness. She had\nacted in just the same manner as a hypnotized person to whom Bernheim\nhad given the injunction that five minutes after his awakening in the\nward he was to open an umbrella, and he had carried out this order on\nawakening, but could give no motive for his so doing. We have exactly\nsuch facts in mind when we speak of the existence of _unconscious\npsychological processes_. Let anyone in the world account for these\nfacts in a more correct scientific manner, and we will gladly withdraw\ncompletely our assumption of unconscious psychological processes. Until\nthen, however, we shall continue to use this assumption, and when anyone\nwants to bring forward the objection that the unconscious can have no\nreality for science and is a mere makeshift, (_une facon de parler_), we\nmust simply shrug our shoulders and reject his incomprehensible\nstatement resignedly. A strange unreality which can call out such real\nand palpable effects as a compulsion symptom!\nIn our second patient we meet with fundamentally the same thing. She had\ncreated a decree which she must follow: the pillow must not touch the\nhead of the bed; yet she does not know how it originated, what its\nmeaning is, nor to what motive it owes the source of its power. It is\nimmaterial whether she looks upon it with indifference or struggles\nagainst it, storms against it, determines to overcome it. She must\nnevertheless follow it and carry out its ordinance, though she asks\nherself, in vain, why. One must admit that these symptoms of compulsion\nneurosis offer the clearest evidence for a special sphere of\npsychological activity, cut off from the rest. What else could be back\nof these images and impulses, which appear from one knows not where,\nwhich have such great resistance to all the influences of an otherwise\nnormal psychic life; which give the patient himself the impression that\nhere are super-powerful guests from another world, immortals mixing in\nthe affairs of mortals. Neurotic symptoms lead unmistakably to a\nconviction of the existence of an unconscious psychology, and for that\nvery reason clinical psychiatry, which recognizes only a conscious\npsychology, has no explanation other than that they are present as\nindications of a particular kind of degeneration. To be sure, the\ncompulsive images and impulses are not themselves unconscious--no more\nso than the carrying out of the compulsive-acts escapes conscious\nobservation. They would not have been symptoms had they not penetrated\nthrough into consciousness. But their psychological antecedents as\ndisclosed by the analysis, the associations into which we place them by\nour interpretations, are unconscious, at least until we have made them\nknown to the patient during the course of the analysis.\nConsider now, in addition, that the facts established in our two cases\nare confirmed in all the symptoms of all neurotic diseases, that always\nand everywhere the meaning of the symptoms is unknown to the sufferer,\nthat analysis shows without fail that these symptoms are derivatives of\nunconscious experiences which can, under various favorable conditions,\nbecome conscious. You will understand then that in psychoanalysis we\ncannot do without this unconscious psyche, and are accustomed to deal\nwith it as with something tangible. Perhaps you will also be able to\nunderstand how those who know the unconscious only as an idea, who have\nnever analyzed, never interpreted dreams, or never translated neurotic\nsymptoms into meaning and purpose, are most ill-suited to pass an\nopinion on this subject. Let us express our point of view once more. Our\nability to give meaning to neurotic symptoms by means of analytic\ninterpretation is an irrefutable indication of the existence of\nunconscious psychological processes--or, if you prefer, an irrefutable\nproof of the necessity for their assumption.\nBut that is not all. Thanks to a second discovery of Breuer's, for which\nhe alone deserves credit and which appears to me to be even more\nfar-reaching, we are able to learn still more concerning the\nrelationship between the unconscious and the neurotic symptom. Not alone\nis the meaning of the symptoms invariably hidden in the unconscious; but\nthe very existence of the symptom is conditioned by its relation to this\nunconscious. You will soon understand me. With Breuer I maintain the\nfollowing: Every time we hit upon a symptom we may conclude that the\npatient cherishes definite unconscious experiences which withhold the\nmeaning of the symptoms. Vice versa, in order that the symptoms may come\ninto being, it is also essential that this meaning be unconscious.\nSymptoms are not built up out of conscious experiences; as soon as the\nunconscious processes in question become conscious, the symptom\ndisappears. You will at once recognize here the approach to our therapy,\na way to make symptoms disappear. It was by these means that Breuer\nactually achieved the recovery of his patient, that is, freed her of her\nsymptoms; he found a technique for bringing into her consciousness the\nunconscious experiences that carried the meaning of her symptoms, and\nthe symptoms disappeared.\nThis discovery of Breuer's was not the result of a speculation, but of a\nfelicitous observation made possible by the cooperation of the patient.\nYou should therefore not trouble yourself to find things you already\nknow to which you can compare these occurrences, rather you should\nrecognize herein a new fundamental fact which in itself is capable of\nmuch wider application. Toward this further end permit me to go over\nthis ground again in a different way.\nThe symptom develops as a substitution for something else that has\nremained suppressed. Certain psychological experiences should normally\nhave become so far elaborated that consciousness would have attained\nknowledge of them. This did not take place, however, but out of these\ninterrupted and disturbed processes, imprisoned in the unconscious, the\nsymptom arose. That is to say, something in the nature of an interchange\nhad been effected; as often as therapeutic measures are successful in\nagain reversing this transposition, psychoanalytic therapy solves the\nproblem of the neurotic symptom.\nAccordingly, Breuer's discovery still remains the foundation of\npsychoanalytic therapy. The assertion that the symptoms disappear when\none has made their unconscious connections conscious, has been borne out\nby all subsequent research, although the most extraordinary and\nunexpected complications have been met with in its practical execution.\nOur therapy does its work by means of changing the unconscious into the\nconscious, and is effective only in so far as it has the opportunity of\nbringing about this transformation.\nNow we shall make a hasty digression so that you do not by any chance\nimagine that this therapeutic work is too easy. From all we have learned\nso far, the neurosis would appear as the result of a sort of ignorance,\nthe incognizance of psychological processes that we should know of. We\nwould thus very closely approximate the well-known Socratic teachings,\naccording to which evil itself is the result of ignorance. Now the\nexperienced physician will, as a rule, discover fairly readily what\npsychic impulses in his several patients have remained unconscious.\nAccordingly it would seem easy for him to cure the patient by imparting\nthis knowledge to him and freeing him of his ignorance. At least the\npart played by the unconscious meaning of the symptoms could easily be\ndiscovered in this manner, and it would only be in dealing with the\nrelationship of the symptoms to the experiences of the patient that the\nphysician would be handicapped. In the face of these experiences, of\ncourse, he is the ignorant one of the two, for he did not go through\nthese experiences, and must wait until the patient remembers them and\ntells them to him. But in many cases this difficulty could be readily\novercome. One can question the relatives of the patient concerning these\nexperiences, and they will often be in a position to point out those\nthat carry any traumatic significance; they may even be able to inform\nthe analyst of experiences of which the patient knows nothing because\nthey occurred in the very early years of his life. By a combination of\nsuch means it would seem that the pathogenic ignorance of the patient\ncould be cleared up in a short time and without much trouble.\nIf only that were all! We have made discoveries for which we were at\nfirst unprepared. Knowing and knowing is not always the same thing;\nthere are various kinds of knowing that are psychologically by no means\ncomparable. \"_Il y a fagots et fagots_,\"[39] as Moliere says. The\nknowledge of the physician is not the same as that of the patient and\ncannot bring about the same results. The physician can gain no results\nby transferring his knowledge to the patient in so many words. This is\nperhaps putting it incorrectly, for though the transference does not\nresult in dissolving the symptoms, it does set the analysis in motion,\nand calls out an energetic denial, the first sign usually that this has\ntaken place. The patient has learned something that he did not know up\nto that time, the meaning of his symptoms, and yet he knows it as little\nas before. So we discover there is more than one kind of ignorance. It\nwill require a deepening of our psychological insight to make clear to\nus wherein the difference lies. But our assertion nevertheless remains\ntrue that the symptoms disappear with the knowledge of their meaning.\nFor there is only one limiting condition; the knowledge must be founded\non an inner change in the patient which can be attained only through\npsychic labors directed toward a definite end. We have here been\nconfronted by problems which will soon lead us to the elaboration of a\ndynamics of symptom formation.\nI must stop to ask you whether this is not all too vague and too\ncomplicated? Do I not confuse you by so often retracting my words and\nrestricting them, spinning out trains of thought and then rejecting\nthem? I should be sorry if this were the case. However, I strongly\ndislike simplification at the expense of truth, and am not averse to\nhaving you receive the full impression of how many-sided and complicated\nthe subject is. I also think that there is no harm done if I say more on\nevery point than you can at the moment make use of. I know that every\nhearer and reader arranges what is offered him in his own thoughts,\nshortens it, simplifies it and extracts what he wishes to retain. Within\na given measure it is true that the more we begin with the more we have\nleft. Let me hope that, despite all the by-play, you have clearly\ngrasped the essential parts of my remarks, those about the meaning of\nsymptoms, about the unconscious, and the relation between the two. You\nprobably have also understood that our further efforts are to take two\ndirections: first, the clinical problem--to discover how persons become\nsick, how they later on accomplish a neurotic adaptation toward life;\nsecondly, a problem of psychic dynamics, the evolution of the neurotic\nsymptoms themselves from the prerequisites of the neuroses. We will\nundoubtedly somewhere come on a point of contact for these two problems.\nI do not wish to go any further to-day, but since our time is not yet up\nI intend to call your attention to another characteristic of our two\nanalyses, namely, the memory gaps or amnesias, whose full appreciation\nwill be possible later. You have heard that it is possible to express\nthe object of psychoanalytic treatment in a formula: all pathogenic\nunconscious experience must be transposed into consciousness. You will\nperhaps be surprised to learn that this formula can be replaced by\nanother: all the memory gaps of the patient must be filled out, his\namnesias must be abolished. Practically this amounts to the same thing.\nTherefore an important role in the development of his symptoms must be\naccredited to the amnesias of the neurotic. The analysis of our first\ncase, however, will hardly justify this valuation of the amnesia. The\npatient has not forgotten the scene from which the compulsion act\nderives--on the contrary, she remembers it vividly, nor is there any\nother forgotten factor which comes into play in the development of these\nsymptoms. Less clear, but entirely analogous, is the situation in the\ncase of our second patient, the girl with the compulsive ritual. She,\ntoo, has not really forgotten the behavior of her early years, the fact\nthat she insisted that the door between her bedroom and that of her\nparents be kept open, and that she banished her mother out of her place\nin her parents' bed. She recalls all this very clearly, although\nhesitatingly and unwillingly. Only one factor stands out strikingly in\nour first case, that though the patient carries out her compulsive act\ninnumerable times, she is not once reminded of its similarity with the\nexperience after the bridal-night; nor was this memory even suggested\nwhen by direct questions she was asked to search for its motivation. The\nsame is true of the girl, for in her case not only her ritual, but the\nsituation which provoked it, is repeated identically night after night.\nIn neither case is there any actual amnesia, no lapse of memory, but an\nassociation is broken off which should have called out a reproduction, a\nrevival in the memory. Such a disturbance is enough to bring on a\ncompulsion neurosis. Hysteria, however, shows a different picture, for\nit is usually characterized by most grandiose amnesias. As a rule, in\nthe analysis of each hysterical symptom, one is led back to a whole\nchain of impressions which, upon their recovery, are expressly\ndesignated as forgotten up to the moment. On the one hand this chain\nextends back to the earliest years of life, so that the hysterical\namnesias may be regarded as the direct continuation of the infantile\namnesias, which hides the beginnings of our psychic life from those of\nus who are normal. On the other hand, we discover with surprise that the\nmost recent experiences of the patient are blurred by these losses of\nmemory--that especially the provocations which favored or brought on the\nillness are, if not entirely wiped out by the amnesia, at least\npartially obliterated. Without fail important details have disappeared\nfrom the general picture of such a recent memory, or are placed by false\nmemories. Indeed it happens almost regularly that just before the\ncompletion of an analysis, certain memories of recent experiences\nsuddenly come to light. They had been held back all this time, and had\nleft noticeable gaps in the context.\nWe have pointed out that such a crippling of the ability to recall is\ncharacteristic of hysteria. In hysteria symptomatic conditions also\narise (hysterical attacks) which need leave no trace in the memory. If\nthese things do not occur in compulsion-neuroses, you are justified in\nconcluding that these amnesias exhibit psychological characteristics of\nthe hysterical change, and not a general trait of the neuroses. The\nsignificance of this difference will be more closely limited by the\nfollowing observations. We have combined two things as the meaning of a\nsymptom, its \"whence,\" on the one hand, and its \"whither\" or \"why,\" on\nthe other. By these we mean to indicate the impressions and experiences\nwhence the symptom arises, and the purpose the symptom serves. The\n\"whence\" of a symptom is traced back to impressions which have come from\nwithout, which have therefore necessarily been conscious at some time,\nbut which may have sunk into the unconscious--that is, have been\nforgotten. The \"why\" of the symptom, its tendency, is in every case an\nendopsychic process, developed from within, which may or may not have\nbecome conscious at first, but could just as readily never have entered\nconsciousness at all and have been unconscious from its inception. It\nis, after all, not so very significant that, as happens in the\nhysterias, amnesia has covered over the \"whence\" of the symptom, the\nexperience upon which it is based; for it is the \"why,\" the tendency of\nthe symptom, which establishes its dependence on the unconscious, and\nindeed no less so in the compulsion neuroses than in hysteria. In both\ncases the \"why\" may have been unconscious from the very first.\nBy thus bringing into prominence the unconscious in psychic life, we\nhave raised the most evil spirits of criticism against psychoanalysis.\nDo not be surprised at this, and do not believe that the opposition is\ndirected only against the difficulties offered by the conception of the\nunconscious or against the relative inaccessibility of the experiences\nwhich represent it. I believe it comes from another source. Humanity, in\nthe course of time, has had to endure from the hands of science two\ngreat outrages against its naive self-love. The first was when humanity\ndiscovered that our earth was not the center of the universe, but only\na tiny speck in a world-system hardly conceivable in its magnitude. This\nis associated in our minds with the name \"Copernicus,\" although\nAlexandrian science had taught much the same thing. The second occurred\nwhen biological research robbed man of his apparent superiority under\nspecial creation, and rebuked him with his descent from the animal\nkingdom, and his ineradicable animal nature. This re-valuation, under\nthe influence of Charles Darwin, Wallace and their predecessors, was not\naccomplished without the most violent opposition of their\ncontemporaries. But the third and most irritating insult is flung at the\nhuman mania of greatness by present-day psychological research, which\nwants to prove to the \"I\" that it is not even master in its own home,\nbut is dependent upon the most scanty information concerning all that\ngoes on unconsciously in its psychic life. We psychoanalysts were\nneither the first, nor the only ones to announce this admonition to look\nwithin ourselves. It appears that we are fated to represent it most\ninsistently and to confirm it by means of empirical data which are of\nimportance to every single person. This is the reason for the widespread\nrevolt against our science, the omission of all considerations of\nacademic urbanity, and emancipation of the opposition from all\nrestraints of impartial logic. We were compelled to disturb the peace of\nthe world, in addition, in another manner, of which you will soon come\nto know.\nNINETEENTH LECTURE\nGENERAL THEORY OF THE NEUROSES\n_Resistance and Suppression_\nIn order to progress in our understanding of the neuroses, we need new\nexperiences and we are about to obtain two. Both are very remarkable and\nwere at the time of their discovery, very surprising. You are, of\ncourse, prepared for both from our discussions of the past semester.\nIn the first place: When we undertake to cure a patient, to free him\nfrom the symptoms of his malady, he confronts us with a vigorous,\ntenacious resistance that lasts during the whole time of the treatment.\nThat is so peculiar a fact that we cannot expect much credence for it.\nThe best thing is not to mention this fact to the patient's relatives,\nfor they never think of it otherwise than as a subterfuge on our part in\norder to excuse the length or the failure of our treatment. The patient,\nmoreover, produces all the phenomena of this resistance without even\nrecognizing it as such; it is always a great advance to have brought him\nto the point of understanding this conception and reckoning with it.\nJust consider, this patient suffers from his symptoms and causes those\nabout him to suffer with him. He is willing, moreover, to take upon\nhimself so many sacrifices of time, money, effort and self-denial in\norder to be freed. And yet he struggles, in the very interests of his\nmalady, against one who would help him. How improbable this assertion\nmust sound! And yet it is so, and if we are reproached with its\nimprobability, we need only answer that this fact is not without its\nanalogies. Whoever goes to a dentist with an unbearable toothache may\nvery well find himself thrusting away the dentist's arm when the man\nmakes for his sick tooth with a pair of pincers.\nThe resistance which the patient shows is highly varied, exceedingly\nsubtle, often difficult to recognize, Protean-like in its manifold\nchanges of form. It means that the doctor must become suspicious and be\nconstantly on his guard against the patient. In psychoanalytic therapy\nwe make use, as you know, of that technique which is already familiar to\nyou from the interpretation of dreams. We tell the patient that without\nfurther reflection he should put himself into a condition of calm\nself-observation and that he must then communicate whatever results this\nintrospection gives him--feelings, thoughts, reminiscences, in the order\nin which they appear to his mind. At the same time, we warn him\nexpressly against yielding to any motive which would induce him to\nchoose or exclude any of his thoughts as they arise, in whatever way the\nmotive may be couched and however it may excuse him from telling us the\nthought: \"that is too unpleasant,\" or \"too indiscreet\" for him to tell;\nor \"it is too unimportant,\" or \"it does not belong here,\" \"it is\nnonsensical.\" We impress upon him the fact that he must skim only across\nthe surface of his consciousness and must drop the last vestige of a\ncritical attitude toward that which he finds. We finally inform him that\nthe result of the treatment and above all its length is dependent on the\nconscientiousness with which he follows this basic rule of the analytic\ntechnique. We know, in fact, from the technique of interpreting dreams,\nthat of all the random notions which may occur, those against which such\ndoubts are raised are invariably the ones to yield the material which\nleads to the uncovering of the unconscious.\nThe first reaction we call out by laying down this basic technical rule\nis that the patient directs his entire resistance against it. The\npatient tries in every way to escape its requirements. First he will\ndeclare that he cannot think of anything, then, that so much comes to\nhis mind that it is impossible to seize on anything definite. Then we\ndiscover with no slight displeasure that he has yielded to this or that\ncritical objection, for he betrays himself by the long pauses which he\nallows to occur in his speaking. He then confesses that he really cannot\nbring himself to this, that he is ashamed to; he prefers to let this\nmotive get the upper hand over his promise. He may say that he did think\nof something but that it concerns someone else and is for that reason\nexempt. Or he says that what he just thought of is really too trivial,\ntoo stupid and too foolish. I surely could not have meant that he should\ntake such thoughts into account. Thus it goes on, with untold\nvariations, in the face of which we continually reiterate that \"telling\neverything\" really means telling everything.\nOne can scarcely find a patient who does not make the attempt to reserve\nsome province for himself against the intrusion of the analysis. One\npatient, whom I must reckon among the most highly intelligent, thus\nconcealed an intimate love relation for weeks; and when he was asked to\nexplain this infringement of our inviolable rule, he defended his action\nwith the argument that he considered this one thing was his private\naffair. Naturally, analytic treatment cannot countenance such right of\nsanctuary. One might as well try in a city like Vienna to allow an\nexception to be made of great public squares like the Hohe Markt or the\nStephans Platz and say that no one should be arrested in those\nplaces--and then attempt to round up some particular wrong-doer. He will\nbe found nowhere but in those sanctuaries. I once brought myself around\nto permit such an exception in the case of a man on whose capacity for\nwork a great deal depended, and who was bound by his oath of service,\nwhich forbade him to tell anyone of certain things. To be sure, he was\nsatisfied with the results--but not I; I resolved never to repeat such\nan attempt under these conditions.\nCompulsion neurotics are exceedingly adept at making this technical rule\nalmost useless by bringing to bear all their over-conscientiousness and\ntheir doubts upon it. Patients suffering from anxiety-hysteria sometimes\nsucceed in reducing it to absurdity by producing only notions so remote\nfrom the thing sought for that analysis is quite unprofitable. But it is\nnot my intention to go into the way in which these technical\ndifficulties may be met. It is enough to know that finally, by means of\nresolution and perseverance, we do succeed in wresting a certain amount\nof obedience from the patient toward this basic rule of the technique;\nthe resistance then makes itself felt in other ways. It appears in the\nform of an intellectual resistance, battles by means of arguments, and\nmakes use of all difficulties and improbabilities which a normal yet\nuninstructed thinking is bound to find in the theory of analysis. Then\nwe hear from one voice alone the same criticisms and objections which\nthunder about us in mighty chorus in the scientific literature.\nTherefore the critics who shout to us from outside cannot tell us\nanything new. It is a veritable tempest in a teapot. Still the patient\ncan be argued with, he is anxious to persuade us to instruct him, to\nteach him, to lead him to the literature, so that he may continue\nworking things out for himself. He is very ready to become an adherent\nof psychoanalysis on condition that analysis spare him personally. But\nwe recognize this curiosity as a resistance, as a diversion from our\nspecial objects, and we meet it accordingly. In those patients who\nsuffer from compulsion neuroses, we must expect the resistance to\ndisplay special tactics. They frequently allow the analysis to take its\nway, so that it may succeed in throwing more and more light on the\nproblems of the case, but we finally begin to wonder how it is that this\nclearing up brings with it no practical progress, no diminution of the\nsymptom. Then we may discover that the resistance has entrenched itself\nin the doubts of the compulsion neurosis itself and in this position is\nable successfully to resist our efforts. The patient has said something\nlike this to himself: \"This is all very nice and interesting. And I\nwould be glad to continue it. It would affect my malady considerably if\nit were true. But I don't believe that it is true and as long as I don't\nbelieve it, it has nothing to do with my sickness.\" And so it may go on\nfor a long time until one finally has shaken this position itself; it is\nthen that the decisive battle takes place.\nThe intellectual resistances are not the worst, one can always get ahead\nof them. But the patient can also put up resistances, within the limits\nof the analysis, whose conquest belongs to the most difficult tasks of\nour technique. Instead of recalling, he actually goes again through the\nattitudes and emotions of his previous life which, by means of the\nso-called \"transference,\" can be utilized as resistances to the\nphysician and the treatment. If the patient is a man, he takes this\nmaterial as a rule from his relations to his father, in whose place he\nnow puts the physician, and in so doing constructs a resistance out of\nhis struggle for independence of person and opinion; out of his ambition\nto equal or to excel his father; out of his unwillingness to assume the\nburden of gratitude a second time in his life. For long times at a\nstretch one receives the impression that the patient desires to put the\nphysician in the wrong and to let him feel his helplessness by\ntriumphing over him, and that this desire has completely replaced his\nbetter intention of making an end to his sickness. Women are adepts at\nexploiting, for the purposes of the resistance, a tender, erotically\ntinged transference to the physician. When this leaning attains a\ncertain intensity, all interest for the actual situation of the\ntreatment is lost, together with every sense of the responsibility which\nwas assumed by undertaking it. The never-failing jealousy as well as the\nembitterment over the inevitable repudiation, however gently effected,\nall must serve to spoil the personal understanding between patient and\nphysician and thus to throw out one of the most powerful propelling\nforces of the analysis.\nResistances of this sort must not be narrow-mindedly condemned. They\ncontain so much of the most important material of the patient's past and\nreproduce it in such a convincing manner, that they become of the\ngreatest aid to the analysis, if a skillful technique is able to turn\nthem in the right direction. It is only remarkable that this material is\nat first always in the service of the resistance, for which it serves as\na barrier against the treatment. One can also say that here are traits\nof character, adjustments of the ego which were mobilized in order to\ndefeat the attempted change. We are thus able to learn how these traits\narose under the conditions of the neurosis, as a reaction to its\ndemands, and to see features more clearly in this character which could\notherwise not have shown up so clearly or at least not to this extent,\nand which one may therefore designate as latent. You must also not get\nthe impression that we see an unforeseen endangering of the analytic\ninfluence in the appearance of these resistances. On the contrary, we\nknow that these resistances must come to light; we are dissatisfied only\nwhen we do not provoke them in their full strength and so make them\nplain to the patient Indeed, we at last understand that overcoming these\nresistances is the essential achievement of analysis and is that portion\nof the work which alone assures us that we have accomplished something\nwith the patient.\nYou must also take into account the fact that any accidental occurrences\nwhich arise during the treatment will be made use of by the patient as a\ndisturbance--every diverting incident, every statement about analysis\nfrom an inimical authority in his circle, any chance illness or any\norganic affection which complicates the neurosis; indeed, he even uses\nevery improvement of his condition as a motive for abating his efforts.\nYou will then have gained an approximate, though still an incomplete\npicture of the forms and devices of the resistance which must be met\nand overcome in the course of every analysis. I have given this point\nsuch detailed consideration because I am about to inform you that our\ndynamic conception of the neurosis is based on this experience with the\nresistance of neurotic patients against the banishment of their\nsymptoms. Breuer and I both originally practiced psycho-therapy by means\nof hypnosis. Breuer's first patient was treated throughout under a\ncondition of hypnotic suggestibility, and I at first followed his\nexample. I admit that my work at that time progressed easily and\nagreeably and also took much less time. But the results were capricious\nand not permanent; therefore I finally gave up hypnotism. Then only did\nI realize that no insight into the forces which produce these diseases\nwas possible as long as one used hypnotism. The condition of hypnosis\ncould prevent the physician from realizing the existence of a\nresistance. Hypnosis drives back the resistance and frees a certain\nfield for the work of analysis, but similarly to the doubt in the\ncompulsion neurosis, in so doing it clogs the boundaries of this field\ntill they become impenetrable. That is why I can say that true\npsychoanalysis began when the help of hypnotism was renounced.\nBut if the establishment of the resistance thus becomes a matter of such\nimportance, then surely we must give our caution full rein, and follow\nup any doubts as to whether we are not all too ready in our assumption\nof their existence. Perhaps there really are neurotic cases in which\nassociations appear for other reasons, perhaps the arguments against our\nhypothesis really deserve more consideration and we are unjustified in\nconveniently rejecting all intellectual criticisms of analysis as a\nresistance. Indeed, ladies and gentlemen, but our judgment was by no\nmeans readily arrived at. We had opportunity to observe every critical\npatient from the first sign of the resistance till after its\ndisappearance. In the course of the treatment, the resistance is\nmoreover constantly changing in intensity. It is always on the increase\nas we approach a new theme, is strongest at the height of its\nelaboration, and dies down again when this theme has been abandoned.\nFurthermore, unless we have made some unusual and awkward technical\nerror, we never have to deal with the full measure of resistance of\nwhich the patient is capable. We could therefore convince ourselves that\nthe same man took up and discarded his critical attitude innumerable\ntimes in the course of the analysis. Whenever we are on the point of\nbringing before his consciousness some piece of unconscious material\nwhich is especially painful to him, then he is critical in the extreme.\nEven though he had previously understood and accepted a great deal,\nnevertheless all record of these gains seems now to have been wiped out.\nHe may, in his desire to resist at any cost, present a picture of\nveritable emotional feeblemindedness. If one succeeds in helping him to\novercome this new resistance, then he regains his insight and his\nunderstanding. Thus his criticism is not an independent function to be\nrespected as such; it plays the role of handy-man to his emotional\nattitude and is guided by his resistance. If something displeases him,\nhe can defend himself against it very ingeniously and appear most\ncritical. But if something strikes his fancy, then he may show himself\neasily convinced. Perhaps none of us are very different, and the patient\nunder analysis shows this dependence of the intellect on the emotional\nlife so plainly only because, under the analysis, he is so hard pressed.\nIn what way shall we now account for the observation that the patient so\nenergetically resists our attempts to rid him of his symptoms and to\nmake his psychic processes function in a normal way? We tell ourselves\nthat we have here come up against strong forces which oppose any change\nin the condition; furthermore, that these forces must be identical with\nthose which originally brought about the condition. Some process must\nhave been functional in the building up of these symptoms, a process\nwhich we can now reconstruct by means of our experiences in solving the\nmeaning of the symptoms. We already know from Breuer's observations that\nthe existence of a symptom presupposes that some psychic process was not\ncarried to its normal conclusion, so that it could not become conscious.\nThe symptom is the substitute for that which did not take place. Now we\nknow where the forces whose existence we suspect must operate. Some\nviolent antagonism must have been aroused to prevent the psychic process\nin question from reaching consciousness, and it therefore remained\nunconscious. As an unconscious thought it had the power to create a\nsymptom. The same struggle during the analytic treatment opposes anew\nthe efforts to carry this unconscious thought over into consciousness.\nThis process we felt as a resistance. That pathogenic process which is\nmade evident to us through the resistance, we will name _repression_.\nWe are now ready to obtain a more definite idea of this process of\nrepression. It is the preliminary condition for the formation of\nsymptoms; it is also a thing for which we have no parallel. If we take\nas prototype an impulse, a psychological process which is striving to\nconvert itself into action, we know that it may succumb before a\nrejection, which we call \"repudiation\" or \"condemnation.\" In the course\nof this struggle, the energy which the impulse had at its disposal was\nwithdrawn from it, it becomes powerless; yet it may subsist in the form\nof a memory. The whole process of decision occurs with the full\nknowledge of the ego. The state of affairs is very different if we\nimagine that this same impulse has been subjected to repression. In that\ncase, it would retain its energy and there would be no memory of it\nleft; in addition, the process of repression would be carried out\nwithout the knowledge of the ego. Through this comparison, however, we\nhave come no nearer understanding the nature of repression.\nI now go into the theoretical ideas which alone have shown themselves\nuseful in making the conception of repression more definite. It is above\nall necessary that we progress from a purely descriptive meaning of the\nword \"unconscious\" to its more systematic meaning; that is, we come to a\npoint where we must call the consciousness or unconsciousness of a\npsychic process only one of its attributes, an attribute which is,\nmoreover, not necessarily unequivocal. If such a process remained\nunconscious, then this separation from consciousness is perhaps only an\nindication of the fate to which it has submitted and not this fate\nitself. To bring this home to us more vividly, let us assume that every\npsychological process--with one exception, which I will go into\nlater--first exists in an unconscious state or phase and only goes over\nfrom this into a conscious phase, much as a photographic picture is\nfirst a negative and then becomes a picture by being printed. But not\nevery negative need become a positive, and just as little is it\nnecessary that every unconscious psychological process should be changed\ninto a conscious one. We find it advantageous to express ourselves as\nfollows: Any particular process belongs in the first place to the\npsychological system of the unconscious; from this system it can under\ncertain conditions go over into the system of the conscious. The crudest\nconception of these systems is the one which is most convenient for us,\nnamely, a representation in space. We will compare the system of the\nunconscious to a large ante-chamber, in which the psychic impulses rub\nelbows with one another, as separate beings. There opens out of this\nante-chamber another, a smaller room, a sort of parlor, which\nconsciousness occupies. But on the threshold between the two rooms there\nstands a watchman; he passes on the individual psychic impulses, censors\nthem, and will not let them into the parlor if they do not meet with his\napproval. You see at once that it makes little difference whether the\nwatchman brushes a single impulse away from the threshold, or whether he\ndrives it out again after it has already entered the parlor. It is a\nquestion here only of the extent of his watchfulness, and the timeliness\nof his judgment. Still working with this simile, we proceed to a further\nelaboration of our nomenclature. The impulses in the ante-chamber of the\nunconscious cannot be seen by the conscious, which is in the other room;\ntherefore for the time being they must remain unconscious. When they\nhave succeeded in pressing forward to the threshold, and have been sent\nback by the watchman, then they are unsuitable for consciousness and we\ncall them _suppressed_. Those impulses, however, which the watchman has\npermitted to cross the threshold have not necessarily become conscious;\nfor this can happen only if they have been successful in attracting to\nthemselves the glance of the conscious. We therefore justifiably call\nthis second room the system of the _fore-conscious_. In this way the\nprocess of becoming conscious retains its purely descriptive sense.\nSuppression then, for any individual impulse, consists in not being able\nto get past the watchman from the system of the unconscious to that of\nthe fore-conscious. The watchman himself is long since known to us; we\nhave met him as the resistance which opposed us when we attempted to\nrelease the suppression through analytic treatment.\nNow I know you will say that these conceptions are as crude as they are\nfantastic, and not at all permissible in a scientific discussion. I know\nthey are crude--indeed, we even know that they are incorrect, and if we\nare not very much mistaken we have a better substitute for them in\nreadiness. Whether they will continue then to appear so fantastic to you\nI do not know. For the time being, they are useful conceptions, similar\nto the manikin _Ampere_ who swims in the stream of the electric current.\nIn so far as they are helpful in the understanding of our observation,\nthey are by no means to be despised. I should like to assure you that\nthese crude assumptions go far in approximating the actual\nsituation--the two rooms, the watchman on the threshold between the two,\nand consciousness at the end of the second room in the role of an\nonlooker. I should also like to hear you admit that our\ndesignations--_unconscious_, _fore-conscious_, and _conscious_ are much\nless likely to arouse prejudice, and are easier to justify than others\nthat have been used or suggested--such as _sub-conscious_,\n_inter-conscious_, _between-conscious_, etc.\nThis becomes all the more important to me if you should warn me that\nthis arrangement of the psychic apparatus, such as I have assumed in the\nexplanation of neurotic symptoms, must be generally applicable and must\nhold for normal functioning as well. In that, of course, you are right.\nWe cannot follow this up at present, but our interest in the psychology\nof the development of the symptom must be enormously increased if\nthrough the study of pathological conditions we have the prospect of\nfinding a key to the normal psychic occurrences which have been so well\nconcealed.\nYou will probably recognize what it is that supports our assumptions\nconcerning these two systems and their relation to consciousness. The\nwatchman between the unconscious and the fore-conscious is none other\nthan the censor under whose control we found the manifest dream to\nobtain its form. The residue of the day's experiences, which we found\nwere the stimuli which set off the dream, are fore-conscious materials\nwhich at night, during sleep, had come under the influence of\nunconscious and suppressed wishes. Borne along by the energy of the\nwish, these stimuli were able to build the latent dream. Under the\ncontrol of the unconscious system this material was worked over, went\nthrough an elaboration and displacement such as the normal psychic life\nor, better said, the fore-conscious system, either does not know at all\nor tolerates only exceptionally. In our eyes the characteristics of each\nof the two systems were betrayed by this difference in their\nfunctioning. The dependent relation between the fore-conscious and the\nconscious was to us only an indication that it must belong to one of the\ntwo systems. The dream is by no means a pathological phenomenon; it may\nappear in every healthy person under the conditions of sleep. Any\nassumption as to the structure of the psychic apparatus which covers the\ndevelopment of both the dream and the neurotic symptom has also an\nundeniable claim to be taken into consideration in any theory of normal\npsychic life.\nSo much, then, for suppression. It is, however, only a prerequisite for\nthe evolution of the symptom. We know that the symptom serves as a\nsubstitute for a process kept back by suppression. Yet it is no simple\nmatter to bridge this gap between the suppression and the evolution of\nthe substitute. We have first to answer several questions on other\naspects of the problem concerning the suppression and its\nsubstantiation: What kind of psychological stimuli are at the basis of\nthe suppression; by what forces is it achieved; for what motives? On\nthese matters we have only one insight that we can go by. We learned in\nthe investigation of resistance that it grows out of the forces of the\n\"I,\" in other words from obvious and latent traits of character. It must\nbe from the same traits also that suppression derived support; at least\nthey played a part in its development. All further knowledge is still\nwithheld from us.\nA second observation, for which I have already prepared, will help us\nfurther at this point. By means of analysis we can assign one very\ngeneral purpose to the neurotic symptom. This is of course nothing new\nto you. I have already shown it to you in the two cases of neuroses.\nBut, to be sure, what is the significance of two cases! You have the\nright to demand that it be shown to you innumerable times. But I am\nunable to do this. Here again your own experience must step in, or your\nbelief, which may in this matter rely upon the unanimous account of all\npsychoanalysts.\nYou will remember that in these two cases, whose symptoms we subjected\nto searching investigation, the analysis introduced us to the most\nintimate sexual life of these patients. In the first case, moreover, we\ncould identify with unusual clearness the purpose or tendency of the\nsymptoms under investigation. Perhaps in the second case it was\nslightly covered by another factor--one we will consider later. Now, the\nsame thing that we saw in these two examples we would see in all other\ncases that we subjected to analysis. Each time, through analysis, we\nwould be introduced to the sexual wishes and experiences of the patient,\nand every time we would have to conclude that their symptoms served the\nsame purpose. This purpose shows itself to be the satisfaction of sexual\nwishes; the symptoms serve as a sexual satisfaction for the patient,\nthey are a substitute for such satisfactions as they miss in reality.\nRecall the compulsive act of our first patient. The woman longs for her\nintensely beloved husband, with whom she cannot share her life because\nof his shortcoming and weaknesses. She feels she must remain true to\nhim, she can give his place to no one else. Her compulsive symptom\naffords her that for which she pines, ennobles her husband, denies and\ncorrects his weaknesses,--above all, his impotence. This symptom is\nfundamentally a wish-fulfillment, exactly as is a dream; moreover, it is\nwhat a dream not always is, an erotic wish-fulfillment. In the case of\nour second patient you can see that one of the component purposes of her\nceremonial was the prevention of the intercourse of her parents or the\nhindrance of the creation of a new child thereby. You have perhaps also\nguessed that essentially she strove to put herself in the place of her\nmother. Here again we find the removal of disturbances to sexual\nsatisfaction and the fulfillment of personal sexual wishes. We shall\nsoon turn to the complications of whose existence we have given you\nseveral indications.\nI do not want to make reservations as to the universal applicability of\nthese declarations later on, and therefore I wish to call to your\nattention the fact that everything that I say here about suppression,\nsymptom-development and symptom-interpretation has been learned from\nthree types of neuroses--anxiety-hysteria, conversion-hysteria, and\ncompulsion-neuroses--and for the time being is relevant to these forms\nonly. These three conditions, which we are in the habit of combining\ninto one group under the name of \"_transference neuroses_,\" also limit\nthe field open to psychoanalytic therapy. The other neuroses have not\nbeen nearly so well studied by psychoanalysis,--in one group, in fact,\nthe impossibility of therapeutic influence has been the reason for the\nneglect. But you must not forget that psychoanalysis is still a very\nyoung science, that it demands much time and care in preparation for it,\nthat not long ago it was still in the cradle, so to speak. Yet at all\npoints we are about to penetrate into the understanding of those other\nconditions which are not transference neuroses. I hope I shall still be\nable to speak to you of the developments that our assumptions and\nresults have undergone by being correlated with this new material, and\nto show you that these further studies have not led to contradictions\nbut rather to the production of still greater uniformity. Granted that\neverything, then, that has been said here, holds good for the three\ntransference neuroses, allow me to add a new bit of information to the\nevaluation of its symptoms. A comparative investigation into the causes\nof the disease discloses a result that may be confined into the formula:\nin some way or other these patients fell ill through _self-denial_ when\nreality withheld from them the satisfaction of their sexual wishes. You\nrecognize how excellently well these two results are found to agree. The\nsymptoms must be understood, then, as a substitute satisfaction for that\nwhich is missed in life.\nTo be sure, there are all kinds of objections possible to the\ndeclaration that neurotic symptoms are substitutes for sexual\nsatisfaction. I shall still go into two of them today. If you yourself\nhave analytically examined a fairly large number of neurotics you will\nperhaps gravely inform me that in one class of cases this is not at all\napplicable, the symptoms appear rather to have the opposite purpose, to\nexclude sexual satisfaction, or discontinue it. I shall not deny the\ncorrectness of your interpretation. The psychoanalytic content has a\nhabit of being more complicated than we should like to have it. Had it\nbeen so simple, perhaps we should have had no need for psychoanalysis to\nbring it to light. As a matter of fact, some of the traits of the\nceremonial of our second patient may be recognized as of this ascetic\nnature, inimical to sexual satisfaction; for example, the fact that she\nremoves the clocks, which have the magic qualities of preventing nightly\nerections, or that she tries to prevent the falling and breaking of\nvessels, which symbolizes a protection of her virginity. In other cases\nof bed-ceremonials which I was able to analyze, this negative character\nwas far more evident; the ceremonial might consist throughout of\nprotective regulations against sexual recollections and temptations. On\nthe other hand, we have often discovered in psychoanalysis that\nopposites do not mean contradictions. We might extend our assertion and\nsay the symptoms purpose either a sexual satisfaction or a guard against\nit; that in hysteria the positive wish-fulfillment takes precedence,\nwhile in the compulsion neuroses the negative, ascetic characteristics\nhave the ascendancy. We have not yet been able to speak of that aspect\nof the mechanism of the symptoms, their two-sidedness, or polarity,\nwhich enables them to serve this double purpose, both the sexual\nsatisfaction and its opposite. The symptoms are, as we shall see,\ncompromise results, arising from the integration of two opposed\ntendencies; they represent not only the suppressed force but also the\nsuppressing factor, which was originally potent in bringing about the\nnegation. The result may then favor either one side or the other, but\nseldom is one of the influences entirely lacking. In cases of hysteria,\nthe meeting of the two purposes in the same symptom is most often\nachieved. In compulsion-neuroses, the two parts often become distinct;\nthe symptom then has a double meaning, it consists of two actions, one\nfollowing the other, one releasing the other. It will not be so easy to\nput aside a further misgiving. If you should look over a large number of\nsymptom-interpretations, you would probably judge offhand that the\nconception of a sexual substitute-satisfaction has been stretched to its\nutmost limits in these cases. You will not hesitate to emphasize that\nthese symptoms offer nothing in the way of actual satisfaction, that\noften enough they are limited to giving fresh life to sensations or\nphantasies from some sexual complex. Further, you will declare that the\napparent sexual satisfaction so often shows a childish and unworthy\ncharacter, perhaps approximates an act of onanism, or is reminiscent of\nfilthy naughtiness, habits that are already forbidden and broken in\nchildhood. Finally, you will express your surprise that one should\ndesignate as a sexual satisfaction appetites which can only be described\nas horrible or ghastly, even unnatural. As to these last points, we\nshall come to no agreement until we have submitted man's sexual life to\na thorough investigation, and thus ascertained what one is justified in\ncalling sexual.\nTWENTIETH LECTURE\nGENERAL THEORY OF THE NEUROSES\n_The Sexual Life of Man_\nOne might think we could take for granted what we are to understand by\nthe term \"sexual.\" Of course, the sexual is the indecent, which we must\nnot talk about. I have been told that the pupils of a famous\npsychiatrist once took the trouble to convince their teacher that the\nsymptoms of hysteria very frequently represent sexual matters. With this\nintention they took him to the bedside of a woman suffering from\nhysteria, whose attacks were unmistakable imitations of the act of\ndelivery. He, however, threw aside their suggestion with the remark, \"a\ndelivery is nothing sexual.\" Assuredly, a delivery need not under all\ncircumstances be indecent.\nI see that you take it amiss that I jest about such serious matters. But\nthis is not altogether a jest. In all seriousness, it is not altogether\neasy to define the concept \"sexual.\" Perhaps the only accurate\ndefinition would be everything that is connected with the difference\nbetween the two sexes; but this you may find too general and too\ncolorless. If you emphasize the sexual act as the central factor, you\nmight say that everything is sexual which seeks to obtain sensual\nexcitement from the body and especially from the sexual organs of the\nopposite sex, and which aims toward the union of the genitals and the\nperformance of the sexual act. But then you are really very close to the\ncomparison of sexual and indecent, and the act of delivery is not\nsexual. But if you think of the function of reproduction as the nucleus\nof sexuality you are in danger of excluding a number of things that do\nnot aim at reproduction but are certainly sexual, such as onanism or\neven kissing. But we are prepared to realize that attempts at definition\nalways lead to difficulties; let us give up the attempt to achieve the\nunusual in our particular case. We may suspect that in the development\nof the concept \"sexual\" something occurred which resulted in a false\ndisguise. On the whole, we are quite well oriented as to what people\ncall sexual.\nThe inclusion of the following factors in our concept \"sexual\" amply\nsuffices for all practical purposes in ordinary life: the contrast\nbetween the sexes, the attainment of sexual excitement, the function of\nreproduction, the characteristic of an indecency that must be kept\nconcealed. But this is no longer satisfactory to science. For through\ncareful examinations, rendered possible only by the sacrifices and the\nunselfishness of the subjects, we have come in contact with groups of\nhuman beings whose sexual life deviates strikingly from the average. One\ngroup among them, the \"perverse,\" have, as it were, crossed off the\ndifference between the sexes from their program. Only the same sex can\narouse their sexual desires; the other sex, even the sexual parts, no\nlonger serve as objects for their sexual desires, and in extreme cases,\nbecome a subject for disgust. They have to that extent, of course,\nforegone any participation in reproduction. We call such persons\nhomosexual or inverted. Often, though not always, they are men and women\nof high physical, intellectual and ethical development, who are affected\nonly with this one portentous abnormality. Through their scientific\nleaders they proclaim themselves to be a special species of mankind, \"a\nthird sex,\" which shares equal rights with the two other sexes. Perhaps\nwe shall have occasion to examine their claims critically. Of course\nthey are not, as they would like to claim, the \"elect\" of humanity, but\ncomprise just as many worthless second-rate individuals as those who\npossess a different sexual organization.\nAt any rate, this type among the perverse seek to achieve the same ends\nwith the object of their desires as do normal people. But in the same\ngroup there exists a long succession of abnormal individuals whose\nsexual activities are more and more alien to what seems desirable to the\nsensible person. In their manifold strangeness they seem comparable only\nto the grotesque freaks that P. Breughel painted as the temptation of\nSaint Anthony, or the forgotten gods and believers that G. Flaubert\npictures in the long procession that passes before his pious penitent.\nThis ill-assorted array fairly clamors for orderly classification if it\nis not to bewilder our senses. We first divide them, on the one hand,\ninto those whose sexual object has changed, as is the case with\nhomosexualists, and, on the other, those whose sexual aim has changed.\nThose of the first group have dispensed with the mutual union of the\ngenital organs, and have, as one of the partners of the act, replaced\nthe genitals by another organ or part of the body; they have thus\novercome both the short-comings of organic structure and the usual\ndisgust involved. There are others of this group who still retain the\ngenitals as their object, but not by virtue of their sexual function;\nthey participate for anatomic reasons or rather by reason of their\nproximity. By means of these individuals we realize that the functions\nof excretion, which in the education of the child are hushed away as\nindecent, still remain capable of drawing complete sexual interest on\nthemselves. There are still others who have relinquished the genitals\nentirely as an objective, have raised another part of the body to serve\nas the goal of their desire; the woman's breast, the foot, the tress of\nhair. There are also the fetishists, to whom the body part means\nnothing, who are gratified by a garment, a piece of white linen, a shoe.\nAnd finally there are persons who seek the whole object but with certain\npeculiar or horrible demands: even those who covet a defenseless corpse\nfor instance, which they themselves must criminally compel to satisfy\ntheir desire. But enough of these horrors.\nForemost in the second grouping are those perverted ones who have placed\nas the end of their sexual desire performances normally introductory or\npreparatory to it. They satisfy their desire by their eyes and hands.\nThey watch or attempt to watch the other individual in his most intimate\ndoings, or uncover those portions of their own bodies which they should\nconceal in the vague expectation of being rewarded by a similar\nprocedure on the other person's part. Here also belong the enigmatic\nsadists, whose affectionate strivings know no other goal than to cause\ntheir object pain and agony, varying all the way from humiliating\nsuggestions to the harshest physical ill-treatment. As if to balance the\nscale, we have on the other hand the masochists, whose sole satisfaction\nconsists in suffering every variety of humiliation and torture, symbolic\nand real, at the hands of the beloved one. There are still others who\ncombine and confuse a number of these abnormal conditions. Moreover, in\nboth these groups there are those who seek sexual satisfaction in\nreality, and others who are content merely to imagine such\ngratification, who need no actual object at all, but can supplant it by\ntheir own fantastic creations.\nThere can be not the least doubt that the sexual activities of these\nindividuals are actually found in the absurdities, caprices and horrors\nthat we have examined. Not only do they themselves conceive them as\nadequate substitutes, but we must recognize that they take the same\nplace in their lives that normal sex gratification occupies in ours, and\nfor which they bring the same sacrifices, often incommensurate with\ntheir ends. It is perfectly possible to trace along broad lines as well\nas in detail in what way these abnormalities follow the normal procedure\nand how they diverge from it. You will also find the characteristic of\nindecency which belongs to the sexual act in these vagaries, only that\nit is therein magnified to the disreputable.\nLadies and gentlemen, what attitude are we to assume to these unusual\nvarieties of sex gratification? Nothing at all is achieved by the mere\nexpression of indignation and personal disgust and by the assurance that\nwe do not share these lusts. That is not our concern. We have here a\nfield of observation like any other. Moreover, the evasion that these\npersons are merely rarities, curiosities, is easily refuted. On the\ncontrary, we are dealing with very frequent and widespread phenomena.\nIf, however, we are told that we must not permit them to influence our\nviews on sexual life, since they are all aberrations of the sexual\ninstinct, we must meet this with a serious answer. If we fail to\nunderstand these abnormal manifestations of sexuality and are unable to\nrelate them to the normal sexual life, then we cannot understand normal\nsexuality. It is, in short, our unavoidable task to account\ntheoretically for all the potentialities of the perversions we have gone\nover and to explain their relation to the so-called normal sexuality.\nA penetrating insight due to Ivan Bloch and two new experimental results\nwill help us in this task. Bloch takes exception to the point of view\nwhich sees in a perversion a \"sign of degeneration\"; he proves that such\ndeviations from the aim of the sexual instinct, such loose relations to\nthe object of sexuality, have occurred at all times, among the most\nprimitive and the most highly civilized peoples, and have occasionally\nachieved toleration and general recognition. The two experimental\nresults were obtained in the course of psychoanalytic investigations of\nneurotics; they will undoubtedly exert a decided influence on our\nconceptions of sexual perversion.\nWe have stated that the neurotic symptoms are substitutions for sexual\nsatisfactions, and I have given you to understand that the proof of this\nassertion by means of the analysis of symptoms encounters many\ndifficulties. For this statement is only justifiable if, under the term\n\"sexual satisfactions,\" we include the so-called perverse sexual ends,\nsince with surprising frequency we find symptoms which can be\ninterpreted only in the light of their activity. The claim of rareness\nmade by the homosexualists or the inverted immediately collapses when we\nlearn that in the case of no single neurotic do we fail to obtain\nevidence of homosexual tendencies, and that in a considerable number of\nsymptoms we find the expression of this latent inversion. Those who call\nthemselves homosexualists are the conscious and manifest inverts, but\ntheir number is as nothing before the latent homosexualists. We are\nforced to regard the desire for an object of one's own sex as a\nuniversal aberration of erotic life and to cede increasing importance to\nit. Of course the differences between manifest homosexuality and the\nnormal attitude are not thus erased; their practical importance\npersists, but their theoretic value is greatly decreased. Paranoia, a\ndisturbance which cannot be counted among the transference-neuroses,\nmust in fact be assumed as arising regularly from the attempt to ward\noff powerful homosexual tendencies. Perhaps you will recall that one of\nour patients under her compulsive symptoms acted the part of a man,\nnamely that of her own estranged husband; the production of such\nsymptoms, impersonating the actions of men, is very common to neurotic\nwomen. Though this cannot be ascribed directly to homosexuality, it is\ncertainly concerned with its prerequisites.\nYou are probably acquainted with the fact that the neurosis of hysteria\nmay manifest its symptoms in all organic systems and may therefore\ndisturb all functions. Analysis shows that in these symptoms there are\nexpressed all those tendencies termed perverse, which seek to represent\nthe genitals through other organs. These organs behave as substitute\ngenitals; through the study of hysteric symptoms we have come to the\nconclusion that aside from their functional activities, the organs of\nthe body have a sexual significance, and that the performance of their\nfunctions is disturbed if the sexual factor claims too much attention.\nCountless sensations and innervations, which appear as symptoms of\nhysteria, in organs apparently not concerned with sexuality, are thus\ndiscovered as bound up with the fulfillment of perverse sexual desires\nthrough the transference of sex instincts to other organs. These\nsymptoms bring home to us the extent to which the organs used in the\nconsumption of food and in excretion may become the bearers of sexual\nexcitement. We see repeated here the same picture which the perversions\nhave openly and unmistakably lain before us; in hysteria, however, we\nmust make the detour of interpreting symptoms, and in this case the\nperverse sexual tendencies must be ascribed not to the conscious but to\nthe unconscious life of the individual.\nAmong the many symptoms manifested in compulsion neurosis, the most\nimportant are those produced by too powerful sadistic tendencies, i.e.,\nsexual tendencies with perverted aim. These symptoms, in accordance with\nthe structure of compulsion neurosis, serve primarily as a rejection of\nthese desires, or they express a struggle between satisfaction and\nrejection. In this struggle, the satisfaction is never excessively\ncurtailed; it achieves its results in the patient's behavior in a\nroundabout way, by preference turning against his own person in\nself-inflicted torture. Other forms of neurosis, characterized by\nintensive worry, are the expression of an exaggerated sexualization of\nacts that are ordinarily only preparatory to sexual satisfactions; such\nare the desires to see, to touch, to investigate. Here is thus explained\nthe great importance of the fear of contact and also of the compulsion\nto wash. An unbelievably large portion of compulsion acts may, in the\nform of disguised repetitions and modifications, be traced back to\nonanism, admittedly the only uniform action which accompanies the most\nvaried flights of the sexual imagination.\nIt would cost me very little effort to interweave far more closely the\nrelation between perversion and neurosis, but I believe that what I have\nsaid is sufficient for our purposes. We must avoid the error of\noverestimating the frequency and intensity of perverse inclinations in\nthe light of these interpretations of symptoms. You have heard that a\nneurosis may develop from the denial of normal sexual satisfactions.\nThrough this actual denial the need is forced into the abnormal paths\nof sex excitement. You will later obtain a better insight into the way\nthis happens. You certainly understand, that through such \"_collateral_\"\nhindrance, the perverse tendencies must become more powerful than they\nwould have been if no actual obstacle had been put in the way of a\nnormal sexual satisfaction. As a matter of fact, a similar influence may\nbe recognized in manifest perversions. In many cases, they are provoked\nor motivated by the fact that too great difficulties stand in the way of\nnormal sexual satisfactions, owing to temporary circumstances or to the\npermanent institutions of society. In other cases, to be sure, the\nperverse tendencies are entirely independent of such conditions; they\nare, as it were, the normal kind of sexual life for the individual in\nquestion.\nPerhaps you are momentarily under the impression that we have confused\nrather than clarified the relation between normal and perverse\nsexuality. But keep in mind this consideration. If it is true that a\nhindrance or withholding of normal sexual satisfaction will bring out\nperverse tendencies in persons who have not previously shown them, we\nmust assume that these persons must have harbored tendencies akin to\nperversities--or, if you will, perversities in latent form. This brings\nus to the second experimental conclusion of which I spoke, namely, that\npsychoanalytic investigation found it necessary to concern itself with\nthe sexual life of the child, since, in the analysis of symptoms,\nreminiscences and ideas reverted to the early years of childhood.\nWhatever we revealed in this manner was corroborated point by point\nthrough the direct observation of children. The result was the\nrecognition that all inclinations to perversion have their origin in\nchildhood, that children have tendencies toward them all and practice\nthem in a measure corresponding to their immaturity. Perverse sexuality,\nin brief, is nothing more than magnified infantile sexuality divided\ninto its separate tendencies.\nNow you will certainly see these perversions in another light and no\nlonger ignore their relation to the sexual life of man, at the cost, I\ndo not doubt, of surprises and incongruities painful to your emotions.\nAt first you will undoubtedly be disposed to deny everything--the fact\nthat children have something which may be termed sexual life, the truth\nof our observations and the justification of our claim to see in the\nbehavior of children any relation to what is condemned in later years\nas perversity. Permit me first to explain to you the cause of your\nreluctance and then to present to you the sum of our observations. It is\nbiologically improbable, even absurd, to assume that children have no\nsexual life--sexual excitements, desires, and some sort of\nsatisfaction--but that they develop it suddenly between the ages of\ntwelve and fourteen. This would be just as improbable from the viewpoint\nof biology as to say that they were not born with genitals but developed\nthem only in the period of puberty. The new factor which becomes active\nin them at the time is the function of reproduction, which avails itself\nfor its own purposes of all the physical and psychic material already\npresent. You commit the error of confusing sexuality with reproduction\nand thereby block the road to the understanding of sexuality, and of\nperversions and neuroses as well. This error is a prejudice. Oddly\nenough its source is the fact that you yourselves were children, and as\nchildren succumbed to the influence of education. One of the most\nimportant educational tasks which society must assume is the control,\nthe restriction of the sexual instinct when it breaks forth as an\nimpulse toward reproduction; it must be subdued to an individual will\nthat is identical with the mandates of society. In its own interests,\naccordingly, society would postpone full development until the child has\nreached a certain stage of intellectual maturity, for education\npractically ceases with the complete emergence of the sexual impulse.\nOtherwise the instinct would burst all bounds and the work of culture,\nachieved with such difficulty, would be shattered. The task of\nrestraining this sexuality is never easy; it succeeds here too poorly\nand there too well. The motivating force of human society is\nfundamentally economic; since there is not sufficient nourishment to\nsupport its members without work on their part, the number of these\nmembers must be limited and their energies diverted from sexual activity\nto labor. Here, again, we have the eternal struggle for life that has\npersisted from prehistoric times to the present.\nExperience must have shown educators that the task of guiding the sexual\nwill of the new generation can be solved only by influencing the early\nsexual life of the child, the period preparatory to puberty, not by\nawaiting the storm of puberty. With this intention almost all infantile\nsex activities are forbidden to the child or made distasteful to him;\nthe ideal goal has been to render the life of the child asexual. In the\ncourse of time it has really come to be considered asexual, and this\npoint of view has actually been proclaimed by science. In order not to\ncontradict our belief and intentions, we ignore the sexual activity of\nthe child--no slight thing, at that--or are content to interpret it\ndifferently. The child is supposed to be pure and innocent, and whoever\nsays otherwise may be condemned as a shameless blasphemer of the tender\nand sacred feelings of humanity.\nThe children are the only ones who do not join in carrying out these\nconventions, who assert their animal rights, who prove again and again\nthat the road to purity is still before them. It is strange that those\nwho deny the sexuality of children, do not therefore slacken in their\neducational efforts but rather punish severely the manifestations of the\nvery thing they maintain does not exist, and call it \"childish\nnaughtiness.\" Theoretically it is highly interesting to observe that the\nperiod of life which offers most striking evidence against the biased\nconception of asexual childhood, is the time up to five or six years of\nage; after that everything is enveloped by a veil of amnesia, which is\nrent apart only by thorough scientific investigation; it may previously\nhave given way partially in certain forms of dreams.\nNow I shall present to you what is most easily recognizable in the\nsexual life of the child. At first, for the sake of convenience let me\nexplain to you the conception of the libido. Libido, analogous to\nhunger, is the force through which the instinct, here the sex instinct\n(as in the case of hunger it is the instinct to eat) expresses itself.\nOther conceptions, such as sexual excitement and satisfaction, require\nno elucidation. You will easily see that interpretation plays the\ngreatest part in disclosing the sexuality of the suckling; in fact you\nwill probably cite this as an objection. These interpretations proceed\nfrom a foundation of analytic investigation that trace backwards from a\ngiven symptom. The suckling reveals the first sexual impulses in\nconnection with other functions necessary for life. His chief interest,\nas you know, is directed toward the taking in of food; when it has\nfallen asleep at its mother's breast, fully satisfied, it bears the\nexpression of blissful content that will come back again in later life\nafter the experience of the sexual orgasm. That of course would be too\nslight evidence to form the basis of a conclusion. But we observe that\nthe suckling wishes to repeat the act of taking in food without actually\ndemanding more food; he is therefore no longer urged by hunger. We say\nhe is sucking, and the fact that after this he again falls asleep with a\nblissful expression shows us that the act of sucking in itself has\nyielded him satisfaction. As you know, he speedily arranges matters so\nthat he cannot fall asleep without sucking. Dr. Lindner, an old\npediatrist in Budapest, was the first one to ascertain the sexual nature\nof this procedure. Persons attending to the child, who surely make no\npretensions to a theoretic attitude, seem to judge sucking in a similar\nmanner. They do not doubt that it serves a pleasurable satisfaction,\nterm it naughty, and force the child to relinquish it against his will,\nand if he will not do so of his own accord, through painful measures.\nAnd so we learn that the suckling performs actions that have no object\nsave the obtaining of a sensual gratification. We believe that this\ngratification is first experienced during the taking in of food, but\nthat he speedily learns to separate it from this condition. The\ngratification can only be attributed to the excitation of the mouth and\nlips, hence we call these parts of the body _erogenous zones_ and the\npleasure derived from sucking, _sexual_. Probably we shall have to\ndiscuss the justification of this name.\nIf the suckling could express himself, he would probably recognize the\nact of sucking at his mother's breast as the most important thing in\nlife. He is not so far wrong, for in this one act he satisfies two great\nneeds of life. With no small degree of surprise we learn through\npsychoanalysis how much of the physical significance of this act is\nretained through life. The sucking at the mother's breast becomes the\nterm of departure for all of sexual life, the unattained ideal of later\nsex gratification, to which the imagination often reverts in times of\nneed. The mother's breast is the first object for the sexual instinct; I\ncan scarcely bring home to you how significant this object is for\ncentering on the sexual object in later life, what profound influence it\nexerts upon the most remote domains of psychic life through evolution\nand substitution. The suckling, however, soon relinquishes it and fills\nits place by a part of his own body. The child sucks his thumb or his\nown tongue. Thereby he renders himself independent of the consent of the\nouter world in obtaining his sensual satisfactions, and moreover\nincreases the excitement by including a second zone of his body. The\nerogenous zones are not equally satisfactory; it is therefore an\nimportant experience when, as Dr. Lindner puts it, the child while\ntouching his own body discovers the especially excitable genitals, and\nso finds the way from sucking to onanism.\nThrough the evaluation of sucking we become acquainted with two decisive\ncharacteristics of infantile sexuality. It arises in connection with the\nsatisfaction of great organic needs and behaves _auto-erotically_, that\nis to say, it seeks and finds it objects on its own body. What is most\nclearly discernible during the taking in of food is partially repeated\nduring excretion. We conclude that the nursling experiences pleasure\nduring the excretion of urine and the contents of the intestine and that\nhe soon strives to arrange these acts in a way to secure the greatest\npossible amount of satisfaction by the corresponding excitement of the\nerogenous membrane zones. Lou Andreas, with her delicate perceptions,\nhas shown how at this point the outer world first intervenes as a\nhindrance, hostile to the child's desire for satisfaction--the first\nvague suggestion of outer and inner conflicts. He may not let his\nexcretions pass from him at a moment agreeable to him, but only when\nother persons set the time. To induce him to renounce these sources of\nsatisfaction, everything relating to these functions is declared\nindecent and must be concealed. Here, for the first time, he is to\nexchange pleasure for social dignity. His own relation to his excretions\nis originally quite different. He experiences no disgust toward his\nfaeces, values them as a part of his body from which he does not part\nlightly, for he uses them as the first \"present\" he can give to persons\nhe esteems particularly. Even after education has succeeded in\nalienating him from these tendencies, he transfers the evaluation of the\nfaeces to the \"present\" and to \"money.\" On the other hand, he appears to\nregard his achievements in urination with especial pride.\nI know that you have been wanting to interrupt me for a long time and to\ncry: \"Enough of these monstrosities! Excretion a source of sexual\ngratification that even the suckling exploits! Faeces a valuable\nsubstance! The anus a sort of genital! We do not believe it, but we\nunderstand why children's physicians and pedagogues have decidedly\nrejected psychoanalysis and its results.\" No, you have merely forgotten\nthat it was my intention to present to you infantile sexuality in\nconnection with the facts of sexual perversion. Why should you not know\nthat in the case of many grown-ups, homosexuals as well as\nheterosexuals, the locus of intercourse is transferred from the normal\nto a more remote portion of the body. And that there are many\nindividuals who confess to a pleasurable sensation of no slight degree\nin the emptying of the bowels during their entire lives! Children\nthemselves will confirm their interest in the act of defecation and the\npleasure in watching the defecation of another, when they are a few\nyears older and capable of giving expression to their feelings. Of\ncourse, if these children have previously been systematically\nintimidated, they will understand all too well the wisdom of preserving\nsilence on the subject. As for the other things that you do not wish to\nbelieve, let me refer you to the results of analysis and the direct\nobservation of children, and you will realize that it is difficult not\nto see these things or to see them in a different light. I do not even\nobject to making the relation between child-sexuality and sexual\nperversion quite obvious to you. It is really only natural; if the child\nhas sexual life at all, it must necessarily be perverse, because aside\nfrom a few hazy illusions, the child does not know how sexuality gives\nrise to reproduction. The common characteristic of all perversions, on\nthe other hand, is that they have abandoned reproduction as their aim.\nWe term sexual activity perverse when it has renounced the aim of\nreproduction and follows the pursuit of pleasure as an independent goal.\nAnd so you realize that the turning point in the development of sexual\nlife lies in its subjugation to the purpose of reproduction. Everything\nthis side of the turning point, everything that has given up this\npurpose and serves the pursuit of pleasure alone, must carry the term\n\"perverse\" and as such be regarded with contempt.\nPermit me, therefore, to continue with my brief presentation of\ninfantile sexuality. What I have told you about two organic systems I\ncould supplement by a discussion of all the others. The sexual life of\nthe child exhausts itself in the exercise of a series of partial\ninstincts which seek, independently of one another, to gain satisfaction\nfrom his own body or from an external object. Among these organs the\ngenitals speedily predominate. There are persons who continue the\npursuit of satisfaction by means of their own genitals, without the aid\nof another genital or object, uninterruptedly from the onanism of the\nsuckling to the onanism of necessity which arises in puberty, and even\nindefinitely beyond that. The theme of onanism alone would occupy us for\na long period of time; it offers material for diverse observations.\nIn spite of my inclination to shorten the theme, I must tell you\nsomething about the sexual curiosity of children. It is most\ncharacteristic for child sexuality and significant for the study of\nneurotic symptoms. The sexual curiosity of children begins very early,\nsometimes before the third year. It is not connected with the\ndifferences of sexes, which means nothing to the child, since the boy,\nat any rate, ascribes the same male genital to both sexes. When the boy\nfirst discovers the primary sexual structure of the female, he tries at\nfirst to deny the evidence of his senses, for he cannot conceive a human\nbeing who lacks the part of his body that is of such importance to him.\nLater he is terrified at the possibility revealed to him and he feels\nthe influence of all the former threats, occasioned by his intensive\npreoccupation with his little organ. He becomes subject to the\ndomination of the castration complex, the formation of which plays an\nimportant part in the development of his character, provided he remains\nhealthy; of his neurosis, if he becomes diseased; of his resistance, if\nhe is treated analytically. We know that the little girl feels injured\non account of her lack of a large, visible penis, envies the boy his\npossession, and primarily from this motive desires to be a man. This\nwish manifests itself subsequently in neurosis, arising from some\nfailure in her role as a woman. During childhood, the clitoris of the\ngirl is the equivalent of the penis; it is especially excitable, the\nzone where auto-erotic satisfaction is achieved. In the transition to\nwomanhood it is most important that the sensations of the clitoris are\ncompletely transferred at the right time to the entrance of the vagina.\nIn cases of so-called sexual anesthesia of women the clitoris has\nobstinately retained its excitability.\nThe sexual interest of children generally turns first to the mystery of\nbirth--the same problem that is the basis of the questions asked by the\nsphinx of Thebes. This curiosity is for the most part aroused by the\nselfish fear of the arrival of a new child. The answer which the\nnursery has ready for the child, that the stork brings children, is\ndoubted far more frequently than we imagine, even by very young\nchildren. The feeling that he has been cheated out of the truth by\ngrown-ups, contributes greatly to the child's sense of solitude and to\nhis independent development. But the child is not capable of solving\nthis problem unaided. His undeveloped sexual constitution restricts his\nability to understand. At first he assumes that children are produced by\na special substance in one's food and does not know that only women can\nbear children. Later he learns of this limitation and relinquishes the\nderivation of children from food--a supposition retained in the\nfairy-tale. The growing child soon notices that the father plays some\npart in reproduction, but what it is he cannot guess. If, by chance, he\nis witness of a sexual act, he sees in it an attempt to subjugate, a\nscuffle, the sadistic miscomprehension of coitus; he does not however\nrelate this act immediately to the evolution of the child. When he\ndiscovers traces of blood on the bedsheets or on the clothing of his\nmother, he considers them the proof of an injury inflicted by the\nfather. During the latter part of childhood, he imagines that the sexual\norgan of the man plays an important part in the evolution of children,\nbut can ascribe only the function of urination to that part of his body.\nFrom the very outset children unite in believing that the birth of the\nchild takes place through the anus; that the child therefore appears as\na ball of faeces. After anal interests have been proven valueless, he\nabandons this theory and assumes that the navel opens or that the region\nbetween the two breasts is the birthplace of the child. In this way the\ncurious child approaches the knowledge of sexual facts, which, clouded\nby his ignorance, he often fails to see. In the years prior to puberty\nhe generally receives an incomplete, disparaging explanation which often\ncauses traumatic consequences.\nYou have probably heard that the conception \"sexual\" is unduly expanded\nby psychoanalysis in order that it may maintain the hypothesis that all\nneuroses are due to sexual causes and that the meaning of the symptoms\nis sexual. You are now in a position to judge whether or not this\nexpansion is unjustifiable. We have expanded the conception sexual only\nto include the sexual life of children and of perverse persons. That is\nto say, we have reestablished its proper boundaries. Outside of\npsychoanalysis sexuality means only a very limited thing: normal sexual\nlife in the service of reproduction.\nTWENTY-FIRST LECTURE\nGENERAL THEORY OF THE NEUROSES\n_Development of the Libido and Sexual Organizations_\nI am under the impression that I did not succeed in convincing you of\nthe significance of perversions for our conception of sexuality. I\nshould therefore like to clarify and add as much as I can.\nIt was not only perversions that necessitated an alteration of our\nconception of sexuality, which aroused such vehement contradiction. The\nstudy of infantile sexuality did a great deal more along that line, and\nits close correspondence to the perversions became decisive for us. But\nthe origin of the expressions of infantile sexuality, unmistakable as\nthey are in later years of childhood, seem to be lost in obscurity.\nThose who disregard the history of evolution and analytic coherence,\nwill dispute the potency of the sexual factor and will infer the agency\nof generalized forces. Do not forget that as yet we have no generally\nacknowledged criterion for identifying the sexual nature of an\noccurrence, unless we assume that we can find it in a relation to the\nfunctions of reproduction, and this we must reject as too narrow. The\nbiological criteria, such as the periodicities of twenty-three and\ntwenty-eight days, suggested by W. Fliess, are by no means established;\nthe specific chemical nature which we can possibly assume for sexual\noccurrences is still to be discovered. The sexual perversions of adults,\non the other hand, are tangible and unambiguous. As their generally\naccepted nomenclature shows, they are undoubtedly sexual in character;\nwhether we designate them as signs of degeneration, or otherwise, no one\nhas yet had the courage to place them outside the phenomena of sex. They\nalone justify the assertion that sexuality and reproduction are not\ncoincident, for it is clear that all of them disavow the goal of\nreproduction.\nThis brings me to an interesting parallel. While \"conscious\" and\n\"psychic\" were generally considered to be identical, we had to make an\nessay to widen our conception of the \"psychic\" to recognize as psychic\nsomething that was not conscious. Analogously, when \"sexual\" and\n\"related to reproduction\" (or, in shorter form, \"genital\") has been\ngenerally considered identical, psychoanalysis must admit as \"sexual\"\nsuch things as are not \"genital,\" things which have nothing to do with\nreproduction. It is only a formal analogy, but it does not lack a deeper\nbasis.\nBut if the existence of sexual perversions is such a compelling\nargument, why has it not long ago had its effect, and settled the\nquestion? I really am unable to say. It appears to be because the sexual\nperversions are subject to a peculiar ban that extends even into theory,\nand stands in the way of their scientific appreciation. It seems as if\nno one could forget that they are not only revolting, but even\nunnatural, dangerous; as if they had a seductive influence and that at\nbottom one had to stifle a secret envy of those who enjoyed them. As the\ncount who passes judgment in the famous Tannhauser parody admits:\n\"And in the mount of Venus, his honor slipped his mind,\nIt's odd that never happens to people of our kind.\"\nTruthfully speaking, the perverts are rather poor devils who atone most\nbitterly for the satisfaction they attain with such difficulty.\nWhat makes the perverse activity unmistakably sexual, despite all the\nstrangeness of its object, is that the act in perverse satisfaction most\nfrequently is accompanied by a complete orgasm, and by an ejaculation of\nthe genital product. Of course, this is only true in the case of adults;\nwith children orgasms and genital excretions are hardly possible; they\nare replaced by rudiments which, again, are not recognized as truly\nsexual.\nIn order to complete the appreciation of sexual perversions, I have\nsomething to add. Condemned as they are, sharply as they are contrasted\nwith the normal sexual activity, simple observation shows that rarely is\nnormal sex-life entirely free from one or another of the perverse\ntraits. Even the kiss can be claimed to be perverse, for it consists in\nthe union of two erogenous mouth zones in place of the respective\ngenitals. But no one outlaws it as perverse, it is, on the contrary,\nadmitted in theatrical performances as a modified suggestion of the\nsexual act. This very kissing may easily become a complete perversion\nif it results in such intensity that it is immediately followed by an\nemission and orgasm--a thing that is not at all unusual. Further, we can\nlearn that handling and gazing upon the object becomes an essential\nprerequisite to sexual pleasure; that some, in the height of sexual\nexcitation, pinch and bite, that the greatest excitation is not always\ncalled forth in lovers by the genitals, but rather by other parts of the\nbody, and so forth. There is no sense in considering persons with single\ntraits of this kind abnormal, and counting them among the perverts.\nRather, we recognize more and more clearly that the essential nature of\nperversion does not consist in overstepping the sexual aim, nor in a\nsubstitution for the genitals, not even in the variety of objects, but\nsimply in the exclusiveness with which these deviations are carried out\nand by means of which the sexual act that serves reproduction is pushed\naside. When the perverse activities serve to prepare or heighten the\nnormal sexual act, they are really no longer perversions. To be sure,\nthe chasm between normal and perverse sexuality is practically bridged\nby such facts. The natural result is that normal sexuality takes its\norigin from something existing prior to it, since certain components of\nthis material are thrown out and others are combined in order to make\nthem subject to a new aim--that of reproduction.\nBefore we make use of our knowledge of perversions to concentrate anew\nand with clearer perspective on the study of infantile sexuality, I must\ncall your attention to an important difference between the two. Perverse\nsexuality is as a rule extraordinarily centralized, its whole action is\ndirected toward one, usually an isolated, goal. A partial instinct has\nthe upper hand. It is either the only one that can be demonstrated or it\nhas subjected the others to its purposes. In this respect there is no\ndifference between normal and perverse sexuality other than that the\nruling partial instincts, and with them the sexual goals, are different.\nIn the one case as well as in the other there is, so to say, a well\norganized tyranny, excepting that here one family and there another has\nappropriated all the power to itself. Infantile sexuality, on the other\nhand, is on the whole devoid of such centralization and organization,\nits individual component impulses are of equal power, and each\nindependently goes in search of the acquisition of pleasurable\nexcitement. The lack as well as the presence of centralization fit in\nwell with the fact that both the perverse and the normal sexuality\noriginated from the infantile. There are also cases of perverse\nsexuality that have much more similarity with the infantile, where,\nindependently of one another, numerous partial instincts have forced\ntheir way, insisted on their aims, or rather perpetuated them. In these\ncases it is more correct to speak of infantilism of sexual life than of\nperversions.\nThus prepared we can consider a question which we certainly shall not be\nspared. People will say to us: \"Why are you so set on including within\nsexuality those manifestations of childhood, out of which the sexual\nlater develops, but which, according to your own admission, are of\nuncertain origin? Why are you not satisfied rather with the\nphysiological description, and simply say that even in the suckling one\nmay notice activities, such as sucking objects or holding back\nexcrements, which show us that he strives towards an _organic pleasure_?\nIn that way you would have avoided the estranging conception of sexual\nlife in the tiniest child.\" I have nothing to say against organic\npleasure; I know that the most extreme excitement of the sexual union is\nonly an organic pleasure derived from the activity of the genitals. But\ncan you tell me when this organic pleasure, originally not\ndifferentiated, acquires the sexual character that it undoubtedly does\npossess in the later phases of development? Do you know more about the\n\"organic pleasure\" than about sexuality? You will answer, the sexual\ncharacter is acquired when the genitals begin to play their role; sexual\nmeans genital. You will even reject the contrary evidence of the\nperversions by confronting me with the statement that in most\nperversions it is a matter of achieving the genital orgasm, although by\nother means than a union of the genitals. You would really command a\nmuch better position if you did not regard as characteristic of the\nsexual that untenable relation to reproduction seen in the perversions,\nif you replaced it by activity of the genitals. Then we no longer differ\nvery widely; the genital organs merely replace other organs. What do you\nmake of the numerous practices which show you that the genitals may be\nrepresented by other organs in the attainment of gratification, as is\nthe case in the normal kiss, or the perverse practices of \"fast life,\"\nor the symptoms of hysteria? In these neuroses it is quite usual for\nstimulations, sensations and innervations, even the process of erection,\nwhich is localized in the genitals, to be transferred to other distant\nparts of the body, so that you have nothing to which you can hold as\ncharacteristics of the sexual. You will have to decide to follow my\nexample and expand the designation \"sexual\" to include the strivings of\nearly childhood toward organic pleasure.\nNow, for my justification, I should like you to give me the time for two\nmore considerations. As you know, we call the doubtful and indefinable\npleasure activities of earliest childhood sexual because our analysis of\nthe symptoms leads us to them by way of material that is undeniably\nsexual. We admit that it need not for that reason in itself be sexual.\nBut take an analogous case. Suppose there were no way to observe the\ndevelopment of two dicotyledonous plants from their seeds--the apple\ntree and the bean. In both cases, however, imagine it possible to follow\ntheir evolution from the fully developed plant backwards to the first\nseedling with two leaf-divisions. The two little leaves are\nindistinguishable, in both cases they look exactly alike. Shall I\nconclude from this that they really are the same and that the specific\ndifferences between an apple tree and bean plant do not appear until\nlater in the history of the plant? Or is it biologically more correct to\nbelieve that this difference is already present in the seedling,\nalthough the two little leaves show no differences? We do the same thing\nwhen we term as sexual the pleasure derived from the activities of the\nsuckling. Whether each and every organic enjoyment may be called sexual,\nor if besides the sexual there is another that does not deserve this\nname, is a matter I cannot discuss here. I know too little about organic\npleasure and its conditions, and will not be at all surprised if the\nretrogressive character of the analysis leads us back finally to a\ngeneralized factor.\nOne thing more. You have on the whole gained very little for what you\nare so anxious to maintain, the sexual purity of the child, even when\nyou can convince me that the activities of the suckling had better not\nbe called sexual. For from the third year on, there is no longer any\ndoubt concerning the presence of a sexual life in the child. At this\ntime the genitals already begin to become active; there is perhaps\nregularly a period of infantile masturbation, in other words, a\ngratification by means of the genitals. The psychic and social\nexpressions of the sexual life are no longer absent; choice of an\nobject, affectionate preference for certain persons, indeed, a leaning\ntoward one of the two sexes, jealousy--all these have been established\nindependently by unprejudiced observation, prior to the advent of\npsychoanalysis, and confirmed by every careful observer. You will say\nthat you had no doubt as to the early awakening of affection, you will\ntake issue only with its sexual nature. Children between the ages of\nthree and eight have already learned to hide these things, but if you\nlook sharply you can always gather sufficient evidence of the \"sexual\"\npurpose of this affection. What escapes you will be amply supplied by\ninvestigation. The sexual goals of this period of life are most\nintimately connected with the contemporaneous sexual theories, of which\nI have given you some examples. The perverse nature of some of these\ngoals is the result of the constitutional immaturity of the child, who\nhas not yet discovered the goal of the act of copulation.\nFrom about the sixth or the eighth year on a pause in, and reversion of,\nsexual development is noticeable, which in the cases that reach the\nhighest cultural standard deserves the name of a latent period. The\nlatent period may also fail to appear and there need not be an\ninterruption of sexual activity and sexual interests at any period. Most\nof the experiences and impulses prior to the latent period then fall\nvictim to the infantile amnesia, the forgetting we have already\ndiscussed, which cloaks our earliest childhood and makes us strangers to\nit. In every psychoanalysis we are confronted with the task of leading\nthis forgotten period of life back into memory; one cannot resist the\nsupposition that the beginning of sexual life it contains furnishes the\nmotive for this forgetting, namely, that this forgetting is a result of\nsuppression.\nThe sexual life of the child shows from the third year that it has much\nin common with that of the adult; it is distinguished from the latter,\nas we already know, by the lack of stable organization under the primacy\nof the genitals, by the unavoidable traits of perversion, and,\nnaturally, by the far lesser intensity of the whole impulse.\nTheoretically the most interesting phases of the sexual development or,\nas we would rather say, the libido-development, so far as theory is\nconcerned, lie back of this period. This development is so rapidly gone\nthrough that perhaps it would never have been possible for direct\nobservation to grasp its fleeting pictures. Psychoanalytic investigation\nof the neuroses has for the first time made it possible to discover more\nremote phases of the libido-development. These are, to be sure, nothing\nbut constructions, but if you wish to carry on psychoanalysis in a\npractical way you will find that they are necessary and valuable\nconstructions. You will soon understand why pathology may disclose\nconditions which we would have overlooked in the normal object.\nWe can now declare what form the sexual life of the child takes before\nthe primacy of the genitals is established. This primacy is prepared in\nthe first infantile epoch prior to the latent period, and is\ncontinuously organized from puberty on. There is in this early period a\nsort of loose organization, which we shall call _pre-genital_. In the\nforeground of this phase, however, the partial instincts of the genitals\nare not prominent, rather the _sadistic_ and _anal_. The contrast\nbetween _masculine_ and _feminine_ plays no part as yet, its place is\ntaken by the contrast between _active_ and _passive_, which we may\ndesignate as the forerunner of sexual polarity, with which it is later\nfused. That which appears masculine to us in the activity of this phase,\nobserved from the standpoint of the later genital stage, is the\nexpression of an instinct to mastery, which may border on cruelty.\nImpulses with passive goals attach themselves to the erogenous zone of\nthe rectal opening. Most important at this time, curiosity and the\ninstinct to watch are powerful. The genital really takes part in the\nsexual life only in its role as excretory organ for the bladder. Objects\nare not lacking to the partial impulses of this period, but they do not\nnecessarily combine into a single object. The sadistico-anal\norganization is the step antecedent to the phase of genital primacy. A\nmore penetrating study furnishes proof how much of this is retained for\nthe later and final form, and in what ways its partial instincts are\nforced into line under the new genital organization. Back of the\nsadistico-anal phase of libido-development, we get a view of an earlier,\neven more primitive phase of organization, in which the erogenous\nmouth-zone plays the chief role. You may surmise that the sexual\nactivity of sucking belongs to it, and may wonder at the intuition of\nthe ancient Egyptians, whose art characterized the child, as well as\nthe god Horus, with the finger in his month. Abraham only recently\npublished material concerning the traces which this primitive oral phase\nhas left upon the sexual life of later years.\nI can surmise that these details about sexual organization have burdened\nyour mind more than they have informed you. Perhaps I have again gone\ninto detail too much. But be patient; what you have heard will become\nmore valuable through the uses to which it is later put. Keep well in\nmind the impression that sexual life, as we call it, the function, of\nthe libido, does not make its appearance as a completed whole, nor does\nit develop in its own image, but goes through a series of successive\nphases which are not similar to each other. In fact, it is a\ndevelopmental sequence, like that from the grub to the butterfly. The\nturning point of the development is the subordination of all sexual\npartial-instincts to the primacy of the genitals, and thereby the\nsubjection of sexuality to the function of reproduction. Originally it\nis a diffused sexual life, one which consists of independent activities\nof single partial instincts which strive towards organic gratification.\nThis anarchy is modified by approaches to pre-genital organization,\nfirst of all the sadistico-anal phase, prior to this the oral phase,\nwhich is perhaps the most primitive. Added to this there are the various\nprocesses, as yet not well known, which carry over one organization\nlevel to the later and more advanced phase. The significance, for the\nunderstanding of the neuroses, of the long evolutionary path of the\nlibido which carries it over so many grades we shall discuss on another\noccasion.\nToday we shall look at another angle of the development, namely the\nrelation of the partial instinct to the object. We shall make a hurried\nsurvey of this development in order to spend more time upon a relatively\nlater product. Some of the components of the sex instincts have had an\nobject from the very beginning and hold fast to it; such are the\ninstinct to mastery (sadism), curiosity, and the impulse to watch. Other\nimpulses which are more clearly attached to specific erogenous zones of\nthe body have this object only in the beginning, as long as they adhere\nto the functions which are not sexual; they release this object when\nthey free themselves from these non-sexual functions. The first object\nof the oral component of the sexual impulse is the mother's breast,\nwhich satisfies the hunger of the infant. By the act of sucking, the\nerotic component which is also satisfied by the sucking becoming\nindependent, it gives up the foreign object and replaces it by some part\nof its own body. The oral impulse becomes _auto-erotic_, just as the\nanal and other erogenous impulses are from the very beginning. Further\ndevelopment, to express it most briefly, has two goals--first, to give\nup auto-eroticism, and, again, to substitute for the object of one's own\nbody a foreign object; second, to unify the different objects into a\nsingle impulse, replace them by a single object. To be sure, that can\nhappen only if this single object is itself complete, a body similar to\none's own. Nor can it be consummated without leaving behind as useless a\nlarge number of the auto-erotic instinctive impulses.\nThe processes of finding the object are rather involved, and have as yet\nhad no comprehensive exposition. For our purpose, let us emphasize the\nfact that when the process has come to a temporary cessation in the\nchildhood years, before the latent period, the object it has found is\nseen to be practically identical with the first object derived from its\nrelation to the object of the oral pleasure impulse. It is, if not the\nmother's breast, the mother herself. We call the mother the first\n_object of love_. For we speak of love when we emphasize the psychic\nside of sex-impulses, and disregard or for a moment wish to forget the\nfundamental physical or \"sensual\" demands of the instincts. At the time\nwhen the mother becomes the object of love, the psychic work of\nsuppression which withdraws the knowledge of a part of his sexual goal\nfrom his consciousness has already begun in the child. The selection of\nthe mother as the object of love involves everything we understand by\nthe Oedipus complex which has come to have such great significance in\nthe psychoanalytic explanation of neuroses, and which has had no small\npart in arousing opposition to psychoanalysis.\nHere is a little experience which took place during the present war: A\nbrave young disciple of psychoanalysis is a doctor at the German front\nsomewhere in Poland, and attracts the attention of his colleagues by the\nfact that he occasionally exercises an unexpected influence in the case\nof a patient. Upon being questioned he admits that he works by means of\npsychoanalysis and is finally induced to impart his knowledge to his\ncolleagues. Every evening the physicians of the corps, colleagues and\nsuperiors, gather in order to listen to the inmost secrets of analysis.\nFor a while this goes on nicely, but after he has told his audience of\nthe Oedipus-complex, a superior rises and says he does not believe it,\nthat it is shameful for the lecturer to tell such things to them, brave\nmen who are fighting for their fatherland, and who are the fathers of\nfamilies, and he forbade the continuation of the lectures. This was the\nend.\nNow you will be impatient to discover what this frightful\nOedipus-complex consists of. The name tells you. You all know the Greek\nmyth of King Oedipus, who is destined by the fates to kill his father,\nand take his mother to wife, who does everything to escape the oracle\nand then does penance by blinding himself when he discovers that he has,\nunknowingly, committed these two sins. I trust many of you have\nyourselves experienced the profound effect of the tragedy in which\nSophocles handles this material. The work of the Attic poet presents the\nmanner in which the deed of Oedipus, long since accomplished, is finally\nbrought to light by an artistically prolonged investigation,\ncontinuously fed with new evidence; thus far it has a certain similarity\nto the process of psychoanalysis. In the course of the dialogue it\nhappens that the infatuated mother-wife, Jocasta, opposes the\ncontinuation of the investigation. She recalls that many men have\ndreamed that they have cohabited with their mothers, but one should lay\nlittle stress on dreams. We do not lay little stress on dreams, least of\nall typical dreams such as occur to many men, and we do not doubt that\nthis dream mentioned by Jocasta is intimately connected with the strange\nand frightful content of the myth.\nIt is surprising that Sophocles' tragedy does not call forth much\ngreater indignation and opposition on the part of the audience, a\nreaction similar to, and far more justified, than the reaction to our\nsimple military physician. For it is a fundamentally immoral play, it\ndispenses with the moral responsibility of men, it portrays godlike\npowers as instigators of guilt, and shows the helplessness of the moral\nimpulses of men which contend against sin. One might easily suppose that\nthe burden of the myth purposed accusation against the gods and Fate,\nand in the hands of the critical Euripides, always at odds with the\ngods, it would probably have become such an accusation. But there is no\ntrace of this in the work of the believer Sophocles. A pious sophistry\nwhich asserts that the highest morality is to bow to the will of the\ngods, even if they command a crime, helps him over the difficulty. I do\nnot think that this moral constitutes the power of the drama, but so far\nas the effect goes, that is unimportant; the listener does not react to\nit, but to the secret meaning and content of the myth. He reacts as\nthough through self-analysis he had recognized in himself the\nOedipus-complex, and had unmasked the will of the gods, as well as the\noracle, as sublime disguises of his own unconsciousness. It is as though\nhe remembered the wish to remove his father, and in his place to take\nhis mother to wife, and must be horrified at his own desires. He also\nunderstands the voice of the poet as if it were telling him: \"You revolt\nin vain against your responsibility, and proclaim in vain the efforts\nyou have made to resist these criminal purposes. In spite of these\nefforts, you are guilty, for you have not been able to destroy the\ncriminal purposes, they will persist unconsciously in you.\" And in that\nthere is psychological truth. Even if man has relegated his evil\nimpulses to the unconscious, and would tell himself that he is no longer\nanswerable for them, he will still be compelled to experience this\nresponsibility as a feeling of guilt which he cannot trace to its\nsource.\nIt is not to be doubted for a moment that one may recognize in the\nOedipus-complex one of the most important sources for the consciousness\nof guilt with which neurotics are so often harassed. But furthermore, in\na study of the origins of religion and morality of mankind which I\npublished in 1913, under the title of _Totem and Taboo_, the idea was\nbrought home to me that perhaps mankind as a whole has, at the beginning\nof its history, come by its consciousness of guilt, the final source of\nreligion and morality, through the Oedipus-complex. I should like to say\nmore on this subject, but perhaps I had better not. It is difficult to\nturn away from this subject now that I have begun speaking of it, but we\nmust return to individual psychology.\nWhat does direct observation of the child at the time of the selection\nof its object, before the latent period, show us concerning the\nOedipus-complex? One may easily see that the little man would like to\nhave the mother all to himself, that he finds the presence of his\nfather disturbing, he becomes irritated when the latter permits himself\nto show tenderness towards the mother, and expresses his satisfaction\nwhen the father is away or on a journey. Frequently he expresses his\nfeelings directly in words, promises the mother he will marry her. One\nmay think this is very little in comparison with the deeds of Oedipus,\nbut it is actually enough, for it is essentially the same thing. The\nobservation is frequently clouded by the circumstance that the same\nchild at the same time, on other occasions, gives evidence of great\ntenderness towards its father; it is only that such contradictory, or\nrather, _ambivalent_ emotional attitudes as would lead to a conflict in\nthe case of an adult readily take their place side by side in a child,\njust as later on they permanently exist in the unconscious. You might\nwish to interpose that the behavior of the child springs from egoistic\nmotives and does not justify the setting up of an erotic complex. The\nmother provides for all the necessities of the child, and it is\ntherefore to the child's advantage that she troubles herself for no one\nelse. This, too, is correct, but it will soon be clear that in this, as\nin similar situations, the egoistic interest offers only the opportunity\nupon which the erotic impulse seizes. If the little one shows the most\nundisguised sexual curiosity about his mother, if he wants to sleep with\nher at night, insists upon being present while she is dressing, or\nattempts to caress her, as the mother can so often ascertain and\nlaughingly relates, it is undoubtedly due to the erotic nature of the\nattachment to his mother. We must not forget that the mother shows the\nsame care for her little daughter without achieving the same effect, and\nthat the father often vies with her in caring for the boy without being\nable to win the same importance in his eyes as the mother. In short, it\nis clear that the factor of sex-preference cannot be eliminated from the\nsituation by any kind of criticism. From the standpoint of egoistic\ninterest it would merely be stupid of the little fellow not to tolerate\ntwo persons in his services rather than only one.\nI have, as you will have noticed, described only the relation of the boy\nto his father and mother. As far as the little girl is concerned, the\nprocess is the same with the necessary modifications. The affectionate\ndevotion to the father, the desire to set aside the mother as\nsuperfluous and to take her place, a coquetry which already works with\nall the arts of later womanhood, give such a charming picture,\nespecially in the baby girl, that we are apt to forget its seriousness,\nand the grave consequences which may result from this infantile\nsituation. Let us not fail to add that frequently the parents themselves\nexert a decisive influence over the child in the wakening of the Oedipus\nattitude, in that they themselves follow a sex preference when there are\na number of children. The father in the most unmistakable manner shows\npreference for the daughter, while the mother is most affectionate\ntoward the son. But even this factor cannot seriously undermine the\nspontaneous character of the childish Oedipus-complex. The\nOedipus-complex expands and becomes a family-complex when other children\nappear. It becomes the motive force, revived by the sense of personal\ninjury, which causes the child to receive its brothers and sisters with\naversion and to wish to remove them without more ado. It is much more\nfrequent for the children to express these feelings of hatred than those\narising from the parent-complex. If such a wish is fulfilled, and death\ntakes away the undesired increase in the family, after a short while we\nmay discover through analysis what an important experience this death\nwas for the child, even though he had not remembered it. The child\nforced into second place by the birth of a little brother or sister, and\nfor the first time practically isolated from his mother, is loathe to\nforgive her for this; feelings which we would call extreme bitterness in\nan adult are aroused in him and often become the basis of a lasting\nestrangement. We have already mentioned that sexual curiosity with all\nits consequences usually grows out of these experiences of the child.\nWith the growing up of these brothers and sisters the relation to them\nundergoes the most significant changes. The boy may take his sister as\nthe object for his love, to replace his faithless mother; situations of\ndangerous rivalry, which are of vast importance for later life, arise\neven in the nursery among numerous brothers who court the affection of a\nyounger sister. A little girl finds in her older brother a substitute\nfor her father, who no longer acts towards her with the same affection\nas in former years, or she takes a younger sister as a substitute for\nthe child that she vainly wished of her father.\nSuch things, and many more of a similar character, are shown by the\ndirect observation of children and the consideration of their vivid\nchildish recollections, which are not influenced by the analysis. You\nwill conclude, among other things, that the position of a child in the\nsequence of his brothers and sisters is of utmost importance for the\nentire course of his later life, a factor which should be considered in\nevery biography. In the face of these explanations that are found with\nso little effort, you will hardly recall without smiling the scientific\nexplanations for the prohibition of incest. What inventions! By living\ntogether from early childhood the sexual attraction must have been\ndiverted from these members of the family who are of opposite sex, or a\nbiological tendency against in-breeding finds its psychic equivalent in\nan innate dread of incest! In this no account is taken of the fact that\nthere would be no need of so unrelenting a prohibition by law and\nmorality if there were any natural reliable guards against the\ntemptation of incest. Just the opposite is true. The first choice of an\nobject among human beings is regularly an incestuous one, in the man\ndirected toward the mother and sister, and the most stringent laws are\nnecessary to prevent this persisting infantile tendency from becoming\nactive. Among the primitive races the prohibitions against incest are\nmuch more stringent than ours, and recently Th. Reik showed in a\nbrilliant paper that the puberty-rites of the savages, which represent a\nrebirth, have the significance of loosing the incestuous bonds of the\nboy to his mother, and of establishing the reconciliation with the\nfather.\nMythology teaches that incest, apparently so abhorred by men, is\npermitted to the gods without further thought, and you may learn from\nancient history that incestuous marriage with his sister was holy\nprescript for the person of the ruler (among the ancient Pharaohs and\nthe Incas of Peru). We have here a privilege denied the common herd.\nIncest with his mother is one of the sins of Oedipus, patricide the\nother. It might also be mentioned that these are the two great sins\nwhich the first social-religious institution of mankind, totemism,\nabhors. Let us turn from the direct observation of the child to analytic\ninvestigation of the adult neurotic. What does analysis yield to the\nfurther knowledge of the Oedipus-complex? This is easily told. It shows\nthe patient up in the light of the myth; it shows that each of these\nneurotics was himself an Oedipus or, what amounts to the same thing,\nbecame a Hamlet in the reaction to the complex. To be sure, the analytic\nrepresentation of the Oedipus-complex enlarges upon and is a coarser\nedition of the infantile sketch. The hatred of the father, the\ndeath-wish with regard to him, are no longer timidly suggested, the\naffection for the mother recognizes the goal of possessing her for a\nwife. Dare we really accredit these horrible and extreme feelings to\nthose tender childhood years, or does analysis deceive us by bringing in\nsome new element? It is not difficult to discover this. Whenever an\naccount of past events is given, be it written even by a historian, we\nmust take into account the fact that inadvertently something has been\ninterpolated from the present and from intervening times into the past;\nso that the entire picture is falsified. In the case of the neurotic it\nis questionable whether this interpolation is entirely unintentional or\nnot; we shall later come to learn its motives and must justify the fact\nof \"imagining back\" into the remote past. We also easily discover that\nhatred of the father is fortified by numerous motives which originate in\nlater times and circumstances, since the sexual wishes for the mother\nare cast in forms which are necessarily foreign to the child. But it\nwould be a vain endeavor to explain the whole of the Oedipus-complex by\n\"imagining back,\" and as related to later times. The infantile nucleus\nand more or less of what has been added to it continues to exist and may\nbe verified by the direct observation of the child.\nThe clinical fact which we meet with in penetrating the form of the\nOedipus-complex as established by analysis, is of the greatest practical\nimportance. We learn that at the period of puberty, when the sexual\ninstinct first asserts its demands in full strength, the old incestuous\nand familiar objects are again taken up and seized anew by the libido.\nThe infant's choice of an object was feeble, but it nevertheless set the\ndirection for the choice of an object in puberty. At that time very\nintense emotional experiences are brought into play and directed towards\nthe Oedipus-complex, or utilized in the reaction to it. However, since\ntheir presuppositions have become unsupportable, they must in large part\nremain outside of consciousness. From this time on the human individual\nmust devote himself to the great task of freeing himself from his\nparents, and only after he has freed himself can he cease to be a child,\nand become a member of the social community. The task confronting the\nson consists of freeing himself from his libidinous wishes towards his\nmother and utilizing them in the quest for a really foreign object for\nhis love. He must also effect a reconciliation with his father, if he\nhas stayed hostile to him, or if in the reaction to his infantile\nopposition he has become subject to his domination, he must now free\nhimself from this pressure. These tasks are set for every man; it is\nnoteworthy how seldom their solution is ideally achieved, i.e., how\nseldom the solution is psychologically as well as socially correct.\nNeurotics, however, find no solution whatever; the son remains during\nhis whole life subject to the authority of his father, and is not able\nto transfer his libido to a foreign sexual object. Barring the\ndifference in the specific relation, the same fate may befall the\ndaughter. In this sense the Oedipus-complex is correctly designated as\nthe nucleus of the neurosis.\nYou can imagine how rapidly I am reviewing a great number of conditions\nwhich are associated with the Oedipus-complex, of practical as well as\nof theoretical importance. I cannot enter upon their variations or\npossible inversions. Of its less immediate relations I only wish to\nindicate the influence which the Oedipus-complex has been found to exert\non literary production. In a valuable book, Otto Rank has shown that the\ndramatists of all times have taken their materials principally from the\nOedipus-and incest-complexes, with their variations and disguises.\nMoreover, we will not forget to mention that the two guilty wishes of\nOedipus were recognized long before the time of psychoanalysis as the\ntrue representatives of the unrestrained life of impulses. Among the\nwritings of the encyclopedist Diderot we find a famous dialogue, _The\nNephew of Ramau_, which no less a person than Goethe has translated into\nGerman. In this you may read the remarkable sentence: \"_If the little\nsavage were left to himself he would preserve all his imbecility, he\nwould unite the passions of a man of thirty to the unreasonableness of\nthe child in the cradle; he would twist his father's neck and bed with\nhis mother_.\"\nThere is also one other thing of which I must needs speak. The\nmother-wife of Oedipus shall not have reminded us of the dream in vain.\nDo you still remember the result of our dream analysis, that the wishes\nout of which the dream is constructed so frequently are of a perverse,\nincestuous nature, or disclose an enmity toward near and beloved\nrelatives the existence of which had never been suspected? At the time\nwe did not trace the sources of these evil impulses. Now you may see\nthem for yourselves. They represent the disposition made in early\ninfancy of the libidinous energy, with the objects, long since given up\nin conscious life, to which it had once clung, which are now shown at\nnight to be still present and in a certain sense capable of activity.\nBut since all people have such perverse, incestuous and murderous\ndreams, and not the neurotics alone, we may conclude that even those who\nare normal have passed through the same evolutionary development,\nthrough the perversions and the direction of the libidio toward the\nobjects of the Oedipus-complex. This, then, is the way of normal\ndevelopment, upon which the neurotics merely enlarge. They show in\ncruder form what dream analysis exposes in the healthy dreamer as well.\nAccordingly here is one of the motives which led us to deal with the\nstudy of the dream before we considered the neurotic symptom.\nTWENTY-SECOND LECTURE\nGENERAL THEORY OF THE NEUROSES\n_Theories of Development and Regression--Etiology_\nWe have learned that the libidio goes through an extensive development\nbefore it can enter the service of reproduction in a way which may be\nregarded as normal. Now I wish to present to you what importance this\nfact possesses for the causation of neuroses.\nI believe we are in harmony with the teachings of general pathology in\nassuming that this development involves two dangers, inhibition and\nregression. In other words, with the universal tendency of biological\nprocesses toward variation, it must necessarily happen that not all\npreparatory phases of a given function are equally well passed through\nor accomplished with comparable thoroughness. Certain components of a\nfunction may be permanently held back in an early stage of development\nand the complete development is therefore retarded to a certain extent.\nLet us seek analogies for these processes from other fields. If a whole\npeople leaves its dwellings to seek a new home, as frequently happened\nin the early periods of the history of mankind, their entire number will\ncertainly not reach the new destination. Setting aside other losses,\nsmall groups or associations of these wandering peoples would stop on\nthe way, and, while the majority passes on, they would settle down at\nthese way-stations. Or, to seek a more appropriate comparison: You know\nthat in the most highly evolved mammals, the male seminal glands, which\noriginally are located in the far depths of the abdominal cavity, begin\nto wander during a certain period of intra-uterine life until they reach\na position almost immediately under the skin of the pelvic extremity. In\nthe case of a number of male individuals, one of the paired glands may\nas a result of this wandering remain in the pelvic cavity, or may be\npermanently located in the canal through which both glands must pass in\ntheir journey, or finally the canal itself may stay open permanently\ninstead of growing together with the seminal glands after the change of\nposition has taken place normally. When, as a young student, I was doing\nmy first piece of scientific research under the direction of von Bruecke,\nI was working on the dorsal nerve-roots in the spinal cord of a small\nfish very archaic in form. I discovered that the nerve ganglia of these\nroots grow out from large cells which lie in the grey matter of the\ndorsal column, a condition no longer true of other vertebrates. But I\nsoon discovered that such nerve cells are found outside the grey matter\nall the way to the so-called spinal ganglion of the dorsal root. From\nthis I concluded that the cells of this group of ganglia had traveled\nfrom the spinal cord to the roots of the nerves. This same result is\nattested by embryology. In this little fish, however, the entire path of\nthe journey was traceable by the cells that had remained behind. Closer\nobservation will easily reveal to you the weak points of these\ncomparisons. Therefore let me simply say that with reference to every\nsingle sexual impulse, I consider it possible for several of its\ncomponents to be held back in the earlier stages of development while\nother components have worked themselves out to completion. You will\nrealize that we think of every such impulse as a current continuously\ndriving on from the very beginning of life, and that our resolving it\ninto individual movements which follow separately one upon the other is\nto a certain extent artificial. Your impression that these concepts\nrequire further clarification is correct, but an attempt would lead to\ntoo great digression. Before we pass on, however, let us agree to call\nthis arrest of a partial impulse in an early stage of development, a\n_fixation_ of the instinct.\n_Regression_ is the second danger of this development by stages. Even\nthose components which have achieved a degree of progress may readily\nturn backward to these earlier stages. Having attained to this later and\nmore highly developed form, the impulse is forced to a regression when\nit encounters great external difficulties in the exercise of its\nfunction, and accordingly cannot reach the goal which will satisfy its\nstrivings. We can obviously assume that fixation and regression are not\nindependent of each other. The stronger the fixations in the process of\ndevelopment prove to be, the more readily will the function evade\nexternal difficulties by a regression back to those fixations, and the\nless capable will the fully developed function be to withstand the\nhindrances that stand in the way of its exercise. Remember that if a\npeople in its wandering has left large groups at certain way-stations,\nit is natural for those who have gone on to return to these stations if\nthey are beaten or encounter a mighty foe. The more they have left on\nthe way, however, the greater is their chance of defeat.\nFor your comprehension of the neuroses it is necessary to keep in mind\nthis connection between fixation and regression. This will give you a\nsecure hold upon the question of the cause of neuroses--of the etiology\nof neuroses--which we shall soon consider.\nFor the present we have still to discuss various aspects of regression.\nWith the knowledge you have gained concerning the development of the\nfunction of libido, you must expect two kinds of regression: incestuous\nreturn to the first libidinous objects and return of the entire sexual\norganization to an earlier stage of development. Both occur in the\ntransference neuroses and play an important part in its mechanism.\nEspecially is the return to the first incestuous objects of libido a\nfeature that the neurotic exhibits with positively tiresome regularity.\nWe could say far more about regression of libido if we took into\nconsideration another group of neuroses: neurotic narcism. But we cannot\ndo this now. These conditions give us a clue to other stages of\ndevelopment of the function of libido, which have not been mentioned\npreviously, and correspondingly show new kinds of regression. But I\nthink the most important task before me at this point is to warn you not\nto confuse _regression_ and _suppression_, and aid you to see clearly\nthe connection between the two processes. Suppression, as you know, is\nthe process by which an act capable of becoming conscious, in other\nwords, an act that belongs to the fore-conscious system, is rendered\nunconscious and accordingly is thrust back into the unconscious system.\nSimilarly we speak of suppression when the unconscious psychic act never\nhas been admitted into the adjoining fore-conscious system but is\narrested by the censor at the threshold. Kindly observe that the\nconception of suppression has nothing to do with sexuality. It describes\na purely psychological process, which could better be characterized by\nterming it _localized_. By that we mean that it is concerned with the\nspatial relationships within the psyche, or if we drop this crude\nmetaphor, with building up the psychological apparatus out of separate,\npsychic systems.\nThrough these comparisons we observe that up to this point we have not\nused the word regression in its general, but in a very special sense. If\nyou accord it the general meaning of return from a higher to a lower\nstage of development you must include suppression as a form of\nregression, for suppression may also be described as the reversion to an\nearlier and lower stage in the development of a psychic act. Only in\nregard to suppression, this tendency to revert is not necessarily\ninvolved, for when a psychic act is held back in the early unconscious\nstage we also term it suppression in a dynamic sense. Suppression is a\nlocalized and dynamic conception, regression purely descriptive. What up\nthis point we have called regression and considered in its relation to\nfixation, was only the return of libido to former stages of its\ndevelopment. The nature of this latter conception is entirely distinct\nand independent of suppression. We cannot call the libido regressions\npurely psychical processes and do not know what localization in the\npsychological apparatus we should assign to them. Even though the libido\nexerts a most powerful influence on psychic life, its organic\nsignificance is still the most conspicuous.\nDiscussions of this sort, gentlemen, are bound to be somewhat dry. To\nrender them more vivid and impressive, let us return to clinical\nillustrations. You know that hysteria and compulsion-neurosis are the\ntwo chief factors in the group of transference neuroses. In hysteria,\nlibidinous return to primary, incestuous sexual objects is quite\nregular, but regression to a former stage of sexual organization very\nrare. In the mechanism of hysteria suppression plays the chief part. If\nyou will permit me to supplement our previous positive knowledge of this\nneurosis by a constructive suggestion, I could describe the state of\naffairs in this manner: the union of the partial instincts under the\ndomination of the genitals is accomplished, but its results encounter\nthe opposition of the fore-conscious system which, of course, is bound\nup with consciousness. Genital organization, therefore, may stand for\nthe unconscious but not for the fore-conscious. Through this rejection\non the part of the fore-conscious, a situation arises which in certain\naspects is similar to the condition existing before the genitals had\nattained their primacy. Of the two libido regressions, the regression to\na former stage of sexual organization is by far the more conspicuous.\nSince it is lacking in hysteria and our entire conception of the\nneuroses is still too much dominated by the study of hysteria which\npreceded it in point of time, the meaning of libido regression became\nclearer to us much later than that of repression. Let us be prepared to\nwiden and change our attitude still more when we consider other\nnarcistic neuroses besides compulsion-neurosis and hysteria in our\ndiscussion.\nIn contrast to this, regression of libido in compulsion-neurosis turns\nback most conspicuously to the earlier sadistico-anal organization,\nwhich accordingly becomes the most significant factor expressed by the\nsymptoms. Under these conditions the love impulse must mask itself as a\nsadistic impulse. The compulsion idea must therefore be reinterpreted.\nIsolated from other superimposed factors, which though they are not\naccidental are also indispensable, it no longer reads: \"I want to murder\nyou\"; rather it says \"I want to enjoy you in love.\" Add to this, that\nsimultaneously regression of the object has also set in, so that this\nimpulse is invariably directed toward the nearest and dearest persons,\nand you can imagine with what horror the patient thinks of these\ncompulsion ideas and how alien they appear to his conscious perception.\nIn the mechanism of these neuroses, suppression, too, assumes an\nimportant part, which it is not easy to explain in a superficial\ndiscussion of this sort. Regression of the libido without suppression\nwould never result in neurosis but would finally end in perversion. This\nmakes it obvious that suppression is the process most characteristic of\nneurosis, and typifies it most perfectly. Perhaps I shall at some future\ntime have the opportunity of presenting to you our knowledge of the\nmechanism of perversions and then you will see that here also things do\nnot work themselves out as simply as we should best like to construe\nthem.\nYou will most readily reconcile yourself with these elucidations of\nfixation and regression, when you consider them as a preface to the\ninvestigation of the etiology of neuroses. Towards this I have only\nadvanced a single fact: that people become neurotically ill when the\npossibility of satisfying their libido is removed, ill with \"denial,\" as\nI expressed myself, and that their symptoms are the substitutes for the\ndenied gratification. Of course, that does not mean that every denial of\nlibidinous satisfaction makes every person neurotic, but merely that in\nall cases known of neurosis, the factor of denial was traceable. The\nsyllogism therefore cannot be reversed. You also understand, I trust,\nthat this statement is not supposed to reveal the entire secret of the\netiology of neurosis, but only emphasizes an important and indispensable\ncondition.\nNow, we do not know, in the further discussion of this statement,\nwhether to emphasize the nature of denial or the individuality of the\nperson affected by it. Denial is very rarely complete and absolute; to\ncause a pathological condition, the specific gratification desired by\nthe particular person in question must be withheld, the certain\nsatisfaction of which he alone is capable. On the whole there are many\nways of enduring abstinence from libidinous gratification without\nsuccumbing to a neurosis by reason thereof. Above all we know of people\nwho are able to endure abstinence without doing themselves injury; they\nare not happy under the circumstances, they are filled with yearning,\nbut they do not become ill. Furthermore, we must take into consideration\nthat the impulses of the sex instinct are extraordinarily _plastic_, if\nI may use that term in this connection. One thing may take the place of\nthe other; one may assume the other's intensity; if reality refuses the\none gratification, the satisfaction of another may offer full\ncompensation. The sexual impulses are like a network of communicating\nchannels filled with fluids; they are this in spite of their subjugation\nto the primacy of the genitals, though I realize it is difficult to\nunite these two ideas in one conception. The component impulses of\nsexuality as well as the total sexual desire, which represents their\naggregate, show a marked ability to change their object, to exchange it,\nfor instance, for one more easily attainable. This displacement and the\nreadiness to accept substitutes must exert powerful influences in\nopposition to the pathological effect of abstinence. Among these\nprocesses which resist the ill effects of abstinence, one in particular\nhas won cultural significance. Sexual desire relinquishes either its\ngoal of partial gratification of desire, or the goal of desire toward\nreproduction, and adopts another aim, genetically related to the\nabandoned one, save that it is no longer sexual but must be termed\nsocial. This process is called \"sublimation,\" and in adopting this\nprocess we subscribe to the general standard which places social aims\nabove selfish sexual desires. Sublimation is, as a matter of fact, only\na special case of the relation of sexual to non-sexual desires. We shall\nhave occasion to talk more about this later in another connection.\nNow your impression will be that abstinence has become an insignificant\nfactor, since there are so many methods of enduring it. Yet this is not\nthe case, for its pathological power is unimpaired. The remedies are\ngenerally not sufficient. The measure of unsatisfied libido which the\naverage human being can stand is limited. The plasticity and freedom of\nmovement of libido is by no means retained to the same extent by all\nindividuals; sublimation can, moreover, never account for more than a\ncertain small fraction of the libido, and finally most people possess\nthe capacity for sublimation only to a very slight degree. The most\nimportant of these limitations clearly lies in the adaptability of the\nlibido, as it renders the gratification of the individual dependent upon\nthe attainment of only a very few aims and objects. Kindly recall that\nincomplete development of the libido leaves extensive and possibly even\nnumerous libido fixations in earlier developmental phases of the\nprocesses of sexual organization and object-finding, and that these\nphases are usually not capable of affording a real gratification. You\nwill then recognize libido fixation as the second powerful factor which\ntogether with abstinence constitutes the causative factors of the\nillness. We may abbreviate schematically and say that libido fixation\nrepresents the internal disposing factor, abstinence the accidental\nexternal factor of the etiology of neurosis.\nI seize the opportunity to warn you of taking sides in a most\nunnecessary conflict. In scientific affairs it is a popular proceeding\nto emphasize a part of the truth in place of the whole truth and to\ncombat all the rest, which has lost none of its verity, in the name of\nthat fraction. In this way various factions have already separated out\nfrom the movement of psychoanalysis; one faction recognizes only the\negoistic impulses and denies the sexual, another appreciates the\ninfluence of objective tasks in life, but ignores the part played by the\nindividual past, and so on. Here is occasion for a similar antithesis\nand subject for dispute: are neuroses _exogenous_ or _endogenous_\ndiseases, are they the inevitable results of a special constitution or\nthe product of certain harmful (traumatic) impressions; in particular,\nare they called forth by libido fixation (and the sexual constitution\nwhich goes with this) or through the pressure of forbearance? This\ndilemma seems to me no whit wiser than another I could present to you:\nis the child created through the generation of the father or the\nconception of the mother? Both factors are equally essential, you will\nanswer very properly. The conditions which cause neuroses are very\nsimilar if not precisely the same. For the consideration of the causes\nof neuroses, we may arrange neurotic diseases in a series, in which two\nfactors, sexual constitution and experience, or, if you wish,\nlibido-fixation and self-denial, are represented in such a way that one\nincreases as the other decreases. At one end of the series are the\nextreme cases, of which you can say with full conviction: These persons\nwould have become ill because of the peculiar development of their\nlibido, no matter what they might have experienced, no matter how gently\nlife might have treated them. At the other end are cases which would\ncall forth the reversed judgment, that the patients would undoubtedly\nhave escaped illness if life had not thrust certain conditions upon\nthem. But in the intermediate cases of the series, predisposing sexual\nconstitution and subversive demands of life combine. Their sexual\nconstitution would not have given rise to neurosis if the victims had\nnot had such experiences, and their experiences would not have acted\nupon them traumatically if the conditions of the libido had been\notherwise. Within this series I may grant a certain preponderance to the\nweight carried by the predisposing factors, but this admission, too,\ndepends upon the boundaries within which you wish to delimit\nnervousness.\nAllow me to suggest that you call such series _complementary series_. We\nshall have occasion to establish other series of this sort.\nThe tenacity with which the libido clings to certain tendencies and\nobjects, the so-called _adhesiveness_ of the libido, appears to us as an\nindependent factor, individually variable, the determining conditions of\nwhich are completely unknown to us, but the importance of which for the\netiology of the neuroses we can no longer underestimate. At the same\ntime we must not overestimate the closeness of this interrelation. A\nsimilar adhesiveness of the libido occurs--for unknown reasons--in\nnormal persons under various conditions, and is a determining factor in\nthe perverse, who are in a certain sense the opposite of nervous. Before\nthe period of psychoanalysis, it was known (Binet) that the anamnesia of\nthe perverse is often traced back to an early impression--an abnormality\nin the tendency of the instinct or its choice of object--and it is to\nthis that the libido of the individual has clung for life. Frequently it\nis hard to say how such an impression becomes capable of attracting the\nlibido so intensively. I shall give you a case of this kind which I\nobserved myself. A man, to whom the genital and all other sex stimuli of\nwoman now mean nothing, who in fact can only be thrown into an\nirresistible sexual excitation by the sight of a shoe on a foot of a\ncertain form, is able to recall an experience he had in his sixth year,\nwhich proved decisive for the fixation of his libido. One day he sat on\na stool beside his governess, who was to give him an English lesson. She\nwas an old, shriveled, unbeautiful girl with washed-out blue eyes and a\npug nose, who on this day, because of some injury, had put a velvet\nslipper on her foot and stretched it out on a footstool; the leg itself\nshe had most decorously covered. After a diffident attempt at normal\nsexual activity, undertaken during puberty, such a thin sinewy foot as\nhis governess' had become the sole object of his sexuality; and the man\nwas irresistibly carried away if other features, reminiscent of the\nEnglish governess, appeared in conjunction with the foot. Through this\nfixation of the libido the man did not become neurotic but perverse, a\nfoot fetishist, as we say. So you see that, although exaggerated and\npremature fixation of the libido is indispensable for the causation of\nneuroses, its sphere of action exceeds the limits of neuroses\nimmeasurably. This condition also, taken by itself, is no more decisive\nthan abstinence.\nAnd so the problem of the cause of neuroses seems to become more\ncomplicated. Psychoanalytic investigation does, in fact, acquaint us\nwith a new factor, not considered in our etiological series, which is\nrecognized most easily in those cases where permanent well-being is\nsuddenly disturbed by an attack of neurosis. These individuals regularly\nshow signs of contradiction between their wishes, or, as we are wont to\nsay, indication of psychic _conflict_. A part of their personality\nrepresents certain wishes, another rebels against them and resists\nthem. A neurosis cannot come into existence without such conflict. This\nmay seem to be of small significance. You know that our psychic life is\ncontinually agitated by conflicts for which we must find a solution.\nCertain conditions, therefore, must exist to make such a conflict\npathological. We want to know what these conditions are, what psychic\npowers form the background for these pathological conflicts, what\nrelation the conflict bears to the causative factors.\nI hope I shall be able to give you satisfactory answers to these\nquestions even if I must make them schematically brief. Self-denial\ngives rise to conflict, for libido deprived of its gratification is\nforced to seek other means and ends. A pathogenic conflict arises when\nthese other means and ends arouse the disfavor of one part of the\npersonality, and a veto ensues which makes the new mode of gratification\nimpossible for the time being. This is the point of departure for the\ndevelopment of the symptoms, a process which we shall consider later.\nThe rejected libidinous desires manage to have their own way, through\ncircuitous byways, but not without catering to the objections through\nthe observance of certain symptom-formation; the symptoms are the new or\nsubstitute satisfaction which the condition of self-denial has made\nnecessary.\nWe can express the significance of the psychic conflict in another way,\nby saying: the _outer_ self-denial, in order to become pathological,\nmust be supplemented by an _inner_ self-denial. Outer denial removes one\npossibility of gratification, inner denial would like to exclude another\npossibility, and it is this second possibility which becomes the center\nof the ensuing conflict. I prefer this form of presentation because it\npossesses secret content. It implies the probability that the inner\nimpediment found its origin in the prehistoric stage of human\ndevelopment in real external hindrances.\nWhat powers are these which interpose objections to libidinous desire,\nwho are the other parties to the pathological conflict? They are, in the\nwidest sense, the non-sexual impulses. We call them comprehensively the\n\"ego impulses\"; psychoanalysis of transference neuroses does not grant\nus ready access to their further investigation, but we learn to know\nthem, in a measure, through the resistance they offer to analysis. The\npathological struggle is waged between ego-impulses and sexual impulses.\nIn a series of cases it appears as though conflict could exist between\nvarious purely sexual desires; but that is really the same thing, for of\nthe two sexual desires involved in the conflict, one is always\nconsiderate of the ego, while the other demands that the ego be denied,\nand so it remains a conflict between the ego and sexuality.\nAgain and again when psychoanalysis claimed that psychological event was\nthe result of sexual impulses, indignant protest was raised that in\npsychic life there were other impulses and interests besides the sexual,\nthat everything could not be derived from sexuality, etc. Well, it is a\ngreat pleasure to share for once the opinion of one's opponents.\nPsychoanalysis never forgot that non-sexual impulses exist. It insisted\non the decided distinction between sexual and ego-impulses and\nmaintained in the face of every objection not that neuroses arise from\nsexuality, but that they owe their origin to the conflict between\nsexuality and the ego. Psychoanalysis can have no reasonable motive for\ndenying the existence or significance of ego-impulses, even though it\ninvestigates the influence sexual impulses play in illness and in life.\nOnly it has been destined to deal primarily with sexual impulses,\nbecause transference neuroses have furnished the readiest access to\ntheir investigation, and because it had become obligatory to study what\nothers had neglected.\nIt does not follow, either, that psychoanalysis has never occupied\nitself at all with the non-sexual side of personality. The very\ndistinction of the ego from sexuality has shown most clearly that the\nego-impulses also pass through a significant development, which is by no\nmeans entirely independent of the development of the libido, nor does it\nfail to exert a reaction upon it. To be sure, we know much less about\nthe evolution of the ego than about libido development, for so far only\nthe study of narcistic neuroses has promised to throw light on the\nstructure of the ego. There is extant the notable attempt of Ferenczi to\nconstruct theoretically the stages of ego development, and furthermore\nwe already possess two fixed points from which to proceed in our\nevolution of this development. We do not dream of asserting that the\nlibidinous interests of a person are from the outset opposed to the\ninterests of self-preservation; in every stage, rather, the ego will\nstrive to remain in harmony with its sexual organization at that time,\nand accommodate itself thereto. The succession of the separate phases\nof development of libido probably follows a prescribed program; but we\ncannot deny that this sequence can be influenced by the ego, and that a\ncertain parallelism of the phases of development of the ego and the\nlibido may also be assumed. Indeed, the disturbance of this parallelism\ncould become a pathological factor. One of the most important insights\nwe have to gain is the nature of the attitude which the ego exhibits\nwhen an intensive fixation of its libido is left behind in one stage of\nits development. It may countenance the fixation and accordingly become\nperverse or, what amounts to the same thing, become infantile. Or it may\nbe averse to this attachment of the libido, the result of which is that\nwherever the libido is subject to _fixation_, there the ego undergoes\n_suppression_.\nIn this way we reach the conclusion that the third factor of the\netiology of neuroses is the tendency to _conflict_, upon which the\ndevelopment both of the ego and libido are dependent. Our insight into\nthe causation of the neuroses has therefore been amplified. First, the\nmost generalized factor, self-denial, then the fixation of the libido,\nby which it is forced into certain directions, and thirdly, the tendency\nto conflict in the development of the ego, which has rejected libidinous\nimpulses of this kind. The state of affairs is therefore not so confused\nand difficult to see through, as you may have imagined it to be in the\ncourse of my explanation. But of course we are to discover that we have\nnot, as yet, reached the end. We must add still a new factor and further\nanalyze one we already know.\nTo show you the influence of ego development in the formation of a\nconflict, and so to give an illustration of the causation of neuroses, I\nshould like to cite an example which, although it is entirely imaginary,\nis not far removed from probability in any respect. Drawing upon the\ntitle of a farce by Nestroy, I shall label this example \"On the ground\nfloor and in the first story.\" The janitor lives on the ground floor,\nwhile the owner of the house, a rich, distinguished man, occupies the\nfirst story. Both have children, and we shall assume that the owner\npermits his little daughter to play unwatched with the child of the\npeople. Then it may easily happen that the games of the children become\n\"naughty,\" that is, they assume a sexual character; they play \"father\nand mother,\" watch each other in the performance of intimate\nperformances and mutually stimulate their genitals. The janitor's\ndaughter, who, in spite of her five or six years of age, has had\noccasion to make observations on the sexuality of adults, probably\nplayed the part of the seducer. These experiences, even though they be\nof short duration, are sufficient to set in motion certain sexual\nimpulses in both children, which continue in the form of onanism for\nseveral years after the common games have ceased. So far the\nconsequences are similar; the final result will be very different. The\njanitor's daughter will continue onanism possibly to the commencement of\nher periods, abandon it then without difficulty, not many years later\nfind a lover, perhaps bear a child, choose this or that path of life,\nwhich may likely enough make of her a popular artist who ends as an\naristocrat. Perhaps the outcome will be less brilliant, but at any rate\nshe will work out her life, free from neurosis, unharmed by her\npremature sexual activity. Very different is the effect on the other\nchild. Even while she is very young she will realize vaguely that she\nhas done wrong. In a short while, perhaps only after a violent struggle,\nshe will renounce the gratification of onanism, yet still retain an\nundercurrent of depression in her attitude. If, during her early\nchildhood, she chances to learn something about sexual intercourse, she\nwill turn away in explicable disgust and seek to remain innocent.\nProbably she is at the time subjected anew to an irresistible impulse to\nonanism, of which she does not dare to complain. When the time arrives\nfor her to find favor in the eyes of a man, a neurosis will suddenly\ndevelop and cheat her out of marriage and the joy of life. When analysis\nsucceeds in gaining insight into this neurosis, it will reveal that this\nwell-bred, intelligent girl of high ideals, has completely suppressed\nher sexual desires, but that unconsciously they cling to the meager\nexperiences she had with the friend of her childhood.\nThe difference of these two destinies, arising from the same experience,\nis due to the fact that one ego has experienced development while the\nother has not. The janitor's daughter in later years looks upon sexual\nintercourse as the same natural and harmless thing it had seemed in her\nchildhood. The owner's daughter had experienced the influence of\neducation and had recognized its claims. Thus stimulated, her ego had\nforged its ideals of womanly purity and lack of desire which, however,\ncould not agree with any sexual activity; her intellectual development\nhad made unworthy her interest in the woman's part she was to play. This\nhigher moral and intellectual evolution of her ego was in conflict with\nthe claims of her sexuality.\nI should like to consider today one more point in the development of the\nego, partly because it opens wide vistas, partly because it will justify\nthe sharp, perhaps unnatural line of division we are wont to draw\nbetween sexual and ego impulses. In estimating the several developments\nof ego and of libido, we must emphasize an aspect which has not\nfrequently been appreciated heretofore. Both the ego and the libido are\nfundamentally heritages, abbreviated repetitions of an evolution which\nmankind has, in the course of long periods of time, traversed from\nprimeval ages. The libido shows its phylogenetic origin most readily, I\nshould say. Recall, if you please, that in one class of animals the\ngenital apparatus is closely connected with the mouth, that in another\nit cannot be separated from the excretory apparatus, and in others it is\nattached to organs of locomotion. Of all these things you will find a\nmost fascinating description in the valuable book of W. Boelsche. Animals\nportray, so to speak, all kinds of perversions which have become set as\ntheir permanent sexual organizations. In man this phylogenetic aspect is\npartly clouded by the circumstance that these activities, although\nfundamentally inherited, are achieved anew in individual development,\npresumably because the same conditions still prevail and still continue\nto exert their influence on each personality. I should say that\noriginally they served to call forth an activity, where they now serve\nonly as a stimulus for recollection. There is no doubt that in addition\nthe course of development in each individual, which has been innately\ndetermined, may be disturbed or altered from without by recent\ninfluences. That power which has forced this development upon mankind,\nand which today maintains the identical pressure, is indeed known to us:\nit is the same self-denial enforced by the realities--or, given its big\nand actual name, _Necessity_, the struggle for existence, the [Greek]\n'Ananche. This has been a severe teacher, but under him we have become\npotent. The neurotics are those children upon whom this severity has had\na bad effect--but there is risk in all education. This appreciation of\nthe struggle of life as the moving force of development need not\nprejudice us against the importance of \"innate tendencies in evolution\"\nif their existence can be proved.\nIt is worth noting that sexual instincts and instincts of\nself-preservation do not behave similarly when they are confronted with\nthe necessities of actuality. It is easier to educate the instincts of\nself-preservation and everything that is connected with them; they\nspeedily learn to adapt themselves to necessity and to arrange their\ndevelopment in accordance with the mandates of fact. That is easy to\nunderstand, for they cannot procure the objects they require in any\nother way; without these objects the individual must perish. The sex\ninstincts are more difficult to educate because at the outset they do\nnot suffer from the need of an object. As they are related almost\nparasitically to the other functions of the body and gratify themselves\nauto-erotically by way of their own body, they are at first withdrawn\nfrom the educational influence of real necessity. In most people, they\nmaintain themselves in some way or other during the entire course of\nlife as those characteristics of obstinacy and inaccessibility to\ninfluence which are generally collectively called unreasonableness. The\neducation of youth generally comes to an end when the sexual demands are\naroused to their full strength. Educators know this and act accordingly;\nbut perhaps the results of psychoanalysis will influence them to\ntransfer the greatest emphasis to the education of the early years, of\nchildhood, beginning with the suckling. The little human being is\nfrequently a finished product in his fourth or fifth year, and only\nreveals gradually in later years what has long been ready within him.\nTo appreciate the full significance of the aforementioned difference\nbetween the two groups of instincts, we must digress considerably and\nintroduce a consideration which we must needs call _economic_. Thereby\nwe enter upon one of the most important but unfortunately one of the\nmost obscure domains of psychoanalysis. We ask ourselves whether a\nfundamental purpose is recognizable in the workings of our psychological\napparatus, and answer immediately that this purpose is the pursuit of\npleasurable excitement. It seems as if our entire psychological activity\nwere directed toward gaining pleasurable stimulation, toward avoiding\npainful ones; that it is regulated automatically by the _principle of\npleasure_. Now we should like to know, above all, what conditions cause\nthe creation of pleasure and pain, but here we fall short. We may only\nventure to say that pleasurable excitation _in some way_ involves\nlessening, lowering or obliterating the amount of stimuli present in the\npsychic apparatus. This amount, on the other hand, is increased by pain.\nExamination of the most intense pleasurable excitement accessible to\nman, the pleasure which accompanies the performance of the sexual act,\nleaves small doubt on this point. Since such processes of pleasure are\nconcerned with the destinies of quantities of psychic excitation or\nenergy, we call considerations of this sort economic. It thus appears\nthat we can describe the tasks and performances of the psychic apparatus\nin different and more generalized terms than by the emphasis of the\npursuit of pleasure. We may say that the psychic apparatus serves the\npurpose of mastering and bringing to rest the mass of stimuli and the\nstimulating forces which approach it. The sexual instincts obviously\nshow their aim of pleasurable excitement from the beginning to the end\nof their development; they retain this original function without much\nchange. The ego instincts strive at first for the same thing. But\nthrough the influence of their teacher, necessity, the ego instincts\nsoon learn to adduce some qualification to the principle of pleasure.\nThe task of avoiding pain becomes an objective almost comparable to the\ngain of pleasure; the ego learns that its direct gratification is\nunavoidably withheld, the gain of pleasurable excitement postponed, that\nalways a certain amount of pain must be borne and certain sources of\npleasure entirely relinquished. This educated ego has become\n\"reasonable.\" It is no longer controlled by the principle of pleasure,\nbut by the _principle of fact_, which at bottom also aims at pleasure,\nbut pleasure which is postponed and lessened by considerations of fact.\nThe transition from the pleasure principle to that of fact is the most\nimportant advance in the development of the ego. We already know that\nthe sexual instincts pass through this stage unwillingly and late. We\nshall presently learn the consequence to man of the fact that his\nsexuality admits of such a loose relation to the external realities of\nhis life. Yet one more observation belongs here. Since the ego of man\nhas, like the libido, its history of evolution, you will not be\nsurprised to hear that there are \"ego-regressions,\" and you will want to\nknow what role this return of the ego to former phases of development\nplays in neurotic disease.\nTWENTY-THIRD LECTURE\nGENERAL THEORY OF THE NEUROSES\n_The Development of the Symptoms_\nIn the layman's eyes the symptom shows the nature of the disease, and\ncure means removal of symptoms. The physician, however, finds it\nimportant to distinguish the symptoms from the disease and recognizes\nthat doing away with the symptoms is not necessarily curing the disease.\nOf course, the only tangible thing left over after the removal of the\nsymptoms is the capacity to build new symptoms. Accordingly, for the\ntime being, let us accept the layman's viewpoint and consider the\nunderstanding of the symptoms as equivalent to the understanding of the\nsickness.\nThe symptoms,--of course, we are dealing here with psychic (or\npsychogenic) symptoms, and psychic illness--are acts which are\ndetrimental to life as a whole, or which are at least useless;\nfrequently they are obnoxious to the individual who performs them and\nare accompanied by distaste and suffering. The principal injury lies in\nthe psychic exertion which they cost, and in the further exertion needed\nto combat them. The price these efforts exact may, when there is an\nextensive development of the symptoms, bring about an extraordinary\nimpoverishment of the personality of the patient with respect to his\navailable psychic energy, and consequently cripple him in all the\nimportant tasks of life. Since such an outcome is dependent on the\namount of energy so utilized, you will readily understand that \"being\nsick\" is essentially a practical concept. But if you take a theoretical\nstandpoint and disregard these quantitative relations, you can readily\nsay that we are all sick, or rather neurotic, since the conditions\nfavorable to the development of symptoms are demonstrable also among\nnormal persons.\nAs to the neurotic symptoms, we already know that they are the result of\na conflict aroused by a new form of gratifying the libido. The two\nforces that have contended against each other meet once more in the\nsymptom; they become reconciled through the compromise of a symptom\ndevelopment. That is why the symptom is capable of such resistance; it\nis sustained from both sides. We also know that one of the two partners\nto the conflict is the unsatisfied libido, frustrated by reality, which\nmust now seek other means for its satisfaction. If reality remains\ninflexible even where the libido is prepared to take another object in\nplace of the one denied it, the libido will then finally be compelled to\nresort to regression and to seek gratification in one of the earlier\nstages in its organizations already out-lived, or by means of one of the\nobjects given up in the past. Along the path of regression the libido is\nenticed by fixations which it has left behind at these stages in its\ndevelopment.\nHere the development toward perversion branches off sharply from that of\nthe neuroses. If the regressions do not awaken the resistance of the\nego, then a neurosis does not follow and the libido arrives at some\nactual, even if abnormal, satisfaction. The ego, however, controls not\nalone consciousness, but also the approaches to motor innervation, and\nhence the realization of psychic impulses. If the ego then does not\napprove this regression, the conflict takes place. The libido is locked\nout, as it were, and must seek refuge in some place where it can find an\noutlet for its fund of energy, in accordance with the controlling\ndemands for pleasurable gratification. It must withdraw from the ego.\nSuch an evasion is offered by the fixations established in the course of\nits evolution and now traversed regressively, against which the ego had,\nat the time, protected itself by suppressions. The libido, streaming\nback, occupies these suppressed positions and thus withdraws from before\nthe ego and its laws. At the same time, however, it throws off all the\ninfluences acquired under its tutelage. The libido could be guided so\nlong as there was a possibility of its being satisfied; under the double\npressure of external and internal denial it becomes unruly and harks\nback to former and more happy times. Such is its character,\nfundamentally unchangeable. The ideas which the libido now takes over in\norder to hold its energy belong to the system of the unconscious, and\nare therefore subject to its peculiar processes, especially elaboration\nand displacement. Conditions are set up here which are entirely\ncomparable to those of dream formation. Just as the latent dream, the\nfulfillment of a wish-phantasy, is first built up in the\nunconsciousness, but must then pass through conscious processes before,\ncensored and approved, it can enter into the compromise construction of\nthe manifest dream, so the ideas representing the libido in the\nunconscious must still contend against the power of the fore-conscious\nego. The opposition that has arisen against it in the ego follows it\ndown by a \"counter-siege\" and forces it to choose such an expression as\nwill serve at the same time to express itself. Thus, then, the symptom\ncomes into being as a much distorted offshoot from the unconscious\nlibidinous wish-fulfillment, an artificially selected ambiguity--with\ntwo entirely contradictory meanings. In this last point alone do we\nrealize a difference between dream and symptom development, for the only\nfore-conscious purpose in dream formation is the maintenance of sleep,\nthe exclusion from consciousness of anything which may disturb sleep;\nbut it does not necessarily oppose the unconscious wish impulse with an\ninsistent \"No.\" Quite the contrary; the purpose of the dream may be more\ntolerant, because the situation of the sleeper is a less dangerous one.\nThe exit to reality is closed only through the condition of sleep.\nYou see, this evasion which the libido finds under the conditions of the\nconflict is possible only by virtue of the existing fixations. When\nthese fixations are taken in hand by the regression, the suppression is\nside-tracked and the libido, which must maintain itself under the\nconditions of the compromise, is led off or gratified. By means of such\na detour by way of the unconscious and the old fixations, the libido has\nat last succeeded in breaking its way through to some sort of\ngratification, however extraordinarily limited this may seem and however\nunrecognizable any longer as a genuine satisfaction. Now allow me to add\ntwo further remarks concerning this final result. In the first place, I\nshould like you to take note of the intimate connection between the\nlibido and the unconscious on the one hand, and on the other of the ego,\nconsciousness, and reality. The connection that is evidenced here,\nhowever, does not indicate that originally they in any way belong\ntogether. I should like you to bear continually in mind that everything\nI have said here, and all that will follow, pertains only to the symptom\ndevelopment of hysterical neurosis.\nWhere, now, can the libido find the fixations which it must have in\norder to force its way through the suppressions? In the activities and\nexperiences of infantile sexuality, in its abandoned component-impulses,\nits childish objects which have been given up. The libido again returns\nto them. The significance of this period of childhood is a double one;\non the one hand, the instinctive tendencies which were congenital in the\nchild first showed themselves at this time; secondly, at the same time,\nenvironmental influences and chance experiences were first awakening his\nother instincts. I believe our right to establish this bipartite\ndivision cannot be questioned. The assertion that the innate disposition\nplays a part is hardly open to criticism, but analytic experience\nactually makes it necessary for us to assume that purely accidental\nexperiences of childhood are capable of leaving fixations of the libido.\nI do not see any theoretical difficulties here. Congenital tendencies\nundoubtedly represent the after-effects of the experiences of an earlier\nancestry; they must also have once been acquired; without such acquired\ncharacters there could be no heredity. And is it conceivable that the\ninheritance of such acquired characters comes to a standstill in the\nvery generation that we have under observation? The significance of\ninfantile experience, however, should not, as is so often done, be\ncompletely ignored as compared with ancestral experiences or those of\nour adult years; on the contrary, they should meet with an especial\nappreciation. They have such important results because they occur in the\nperiod of uncompleted development, and because of this very fact are in\na position to cause a traumatic effect. The researches on the mechanics\nof development by Roux and others have shown us that a needle prick into\nan embryonic cell mass which is undergoing division results in most\nserious developmental disturbances. The same injury to a larva or a\ncompleted animal can be borne without injury.\nThe libido fixation of adults, which we have referred to as\nrepresentative of the constitutional factor in the etiological\ncomparison of the neuroses, can be thought of, so far as we are\nconcerned, as divisible into two separate factors, the inherited\ndisposition and the tendency acquired in early childhood. We know that a\nschematic representation is most acceptable to the student. Let us\ncombine these relations as follows:\nDisposition as             accidental\nCause of the                determined by              experiences\nneurosis           ==     libido fixation     +      (traumatic\nelement)\n|\n+-------------------------+------------------------+\n|                                                  |\nSexual constitution                             Infantile experience\n(pre-historic experience)\nThe hereditary sexual constitution provides us with manifold tendencies,\nvarying with the special emphasis given one or the other component of\nthe instinct, either individually or in combination. With the factor of\ninfantile experience, there is again built up a complementary series\nwithin the sexual constitution which is perfectly comparable with our\nfirst series, namely, the gradations between disposition and the chance\nexperiences of the adult. Here again we find the same extreme cases and\nsimilar relations in the matter of substitution. At this point the\nquestion becomes pertinent as to whether the most striking regressions\nof the libido, those which hark back to very early stages in sexual\norganization, are not essentially conditioned by the hereditary\nconstitutional factor. The answer to this question, however, may best be\nput off until we are in a position to consider a wider range in the\nforms of neurotic disease.\nLet us devote a little time to the consideration of the fact that\nanalytic investigation of neurotics shows the libido to be bound up with\nthe infantile sexual experiences of these persons. In this light they\nseem of enormous importance for both the life and health of mankind.\nWith respect to therapeutic work their importance remains undiminished.\nBut when we do not take this into account we can herein readily\nrecognize the danger of being misled by the situation as it exists in\nneurotics into adopting a mistaken and one-sided orientation toward\nlife. In figuring the importance of the infantile experiences we must\nalso subtract the influences arising from the fact that the libido has\nreturned to them by regression, after having been forced out of its\nlater positions. Thus we approach the opposite conclusion, that\nexperiences of the libido had no importance whatever in their own time,\nbut rather acquired it at the time of regression. You will remember that\nwe were led to a similar alternative in the discussion of the\nOedipus-complex.\nA decision on this matter will hardly be difficult for us. The statement\nis undoubtedly correct that the hold which the infantile experiences\nhave on the libido--with the pathogenic influences this involves--is\ngreatly augmented by the regression; still, to allow them to become\ndefinitive would nevertheless be misleading. Other considerations must\nbe taken into account as well. In the first place, observation shows, in\na way that leaves no room for doubt, that infantile experiences have\ntheir particular significance which is evidenced already during\nchildhood. There are, furthermore, neuroses in children in which the\nfactor of displacement in time is necessarily greatly minimized or is\nentirely lacking, since the illness follows as an immediate consequence\nof the traumatic experience. The study of these infantile neuroses keeps\nus from many dangerous misunderstandings of adult neuroses, just as the\ndreams of children similarly serve as the key to the understanding of\nthe dreams of adults. As a matter of fact, the neuroses of children are\nvery frequent, far more frequent than is generally believed. They are\noften overlooked, dismissed as signs of badness or naughtiness, and\noften suppressed by the authority of the nursery; in retrospect,\nhowever, they may be easily recognized later. They occur most frequently\nin the form of _anxiety hysteria_. What this implies we shall learn upon\nanother occasion. When a neurosis breaks out in later life, analysis\nregularly shows that it is a direct continuation of that infantile\nmalady which had perhaps developed only obscurely and incipiently.\nHowever, there are cases, as already stated, in which this childish\nnervousness continues, without any interruption, as a lifelong\naffliction. We have been able to analyze a very few examples of such\nneuroses during childhood, while they were actually going on; much more\noften we had to be satisfied with obtaining our insight into the\nchildhood neurosis subsequently, when the patient is already well along\nin life, under conditions in which we are forced to work with certain\ncorrections and under definite precautions.\nSecondly, we must admit that the universal regression of the libido to\nthe period of childhood would be inexplicable if there were nothing\nthere which could exert an attraction for it. The fixation which we\nassume to exist towards specific developmental phases, conveys a meaning\nonly if we think of it as stabilizing a definite amount of libidinous\nenergy. Finally, I am able to remind you that here there exists a\ncomplementary relationship between the intensity and the pathogenic\nsignificance of the infantile experiences to the later ones which is\nsimilar to that studied in previous series. There are cases in which the\nentire causal emphasis falls upon the sexual experiences of childhood,\nin which these impressions take on an effect which is unmistakably\ntraumatic and in which no other basis exists for them beyond what the\naverage sexual constitution and its immaturity can offer. Side by side\nwith these there are others in which the whole stress is brought to bear\nby the later conflicts, and the emphasis the analysis places on\nchildhood impressions appears entirely as the work of regression. There\nare also extremes of \"retarded development\" and \"regression,\" and\nbetween them every combination in the interaction of the two factors.\nThese relations have a certain interest for that pedagogy which assumes\nas its object the prevention of neuroses by an early interference in the\nsexual development of the child. So long as we keep our attention fixed\nessentially on the infantile sexual experiences, we readily come to\nbelieve we have done everything for the prophylaxis of nervous\nafflictions when we have seen to it that this development is retarded,\nand that the child is spared this type of experience. Yet we already\nknow that the conditions for the causation of neuroses are more\ncomplicated and cannot in general be influenced through one single\nfactor. The strict protection in childhood loses its value because it is\npowerless against the constitutional factor; furthermore, it is more\ndifficult to carry out than the educators imagine, and it brings with it\ntwo new dangers that cannot be lightly dismissed. It accomplishes too\nmuch, for it favors a degree of sexual suppression which is harmful for\nlater years, and it sends the child into life without the power to\nresist the violent onset of sexual demands that must be expected during\npuberty. The profit, therefore, which childhood prophylaxis can yield is\nmost dubious; it seems, indeed, that better success in the prevention of\nneuroses can be gained by attacking the problem through a changed\nattitude toward facts.\nLet us return to the consideration of the symptoms. They serve as\nsubstitutes for the gratification which has been forborne, by a\nregression of the libido to earlier days, with a return to former\ndevelopment phases in their choice of object and in their organization.\nWe learned some time ago that the neurotic is held fast somewhere in his\npast; we now know that it is a period of his past in which his libido\ndid not miss the satisfaction which made him happy. He looks for such a\ntime in his life until he has found it, even though he must hark back to\nhis suckling days as he retains them in his memory or as he reconstructs\nthem in the light of later influences. The symptom in some way again\nyields the old infantile form of satisfaction, distorted by the\ncensoring work of the conflict. As a rule it is converted into a\nsensation of suffering and fused with other causal elements of the\ndisease. The form of gratification which the symptom yields has much\nabout it that alienates one's sympathy. In this we omit to take into\naccount, however, the fact that the patients do not recognize the\ngratification as such and experience the apparent satisfaction rather as\nsuffering, and complain of it. This transformation is part of the\npsychic conflict under the pressure of which the symptom must be\ndeveloped. What was at one time a satisfaction for the individual must\nnow awaken his antipathy or disgust. We know a simple but instructive\nexample for such a change of feeling. The same child that sucked the\nmilk with such voracity from its mother's breast is apt to show a strong\nantipathy for milk a few years later, which is often difficult to\novercome. This antipathy increases to the point of disgust when the\nmilk, or any substituted drink, has a little skin over it. It is rather\nhard to throw out the suggestion that this skin calls up the memory of\nthe mother's breast, which was once so intensely coveted. In the\nmeantime, to be sure, the traumatic experience of weaning has\nintervened.\nThere is something else that makes the symptoms appear remarkable and\ninexplicable as a means of libidinous satisfaction. They in no way\nrecall anything from which we normally are in the habit of expecting\nsatisfaction. They usually require no object, and thereby give up all\nconnection with external reality. We understand this to be a result of\nturning away from fact and of returning to the predominance of\npleasurable gratification. But it is also a return to a sort of\namplified autoeroticism, such as was yielded the sex impulse in its\nearliest satisfactions. In the place of a modification in the outside\nworld, we have a physical change, in other words, an internal reaction\nin place of an external one, an adjustment instead of an activity.\nViewed from a phylogenetic standpoint, this expresses a very significant\nregression. We will grasp this better when we consider it in connection\nwith a new factor which we are still to discover from the analytic\ninvestigation of symptom development. Further, we recall that in symptom\nformation the same processes of the unconscious have been at work as in\ndream formation--elaboration and displacement. Similarly to the dream,\nthe symptom represents a fulfillment, a satisfaction after the manner of\nthe infantile; by the utmost elaboration this satisfaction can be\ncompressed into a single sensation or innervation, or by extreme\ndisplacement it may be restricted to a tiny element of the entire\nlibidinous complex. It is no wonder that we often have difficulties in\nrecognizing in the symptom the libidinous satisfaction which we\nanticipate and always find verified.\nI have indicated that we must still become familiar with a new factor.\nIt is something really surprising and confusing. You know that by\nanalysis of the symptoms we arrive at a knowledge of the infantile\nexperiences upon which the libido is fixated and out of which the\nsymptoms are formed. Well, the surprising thing is this, that these\ninfantile scenes are not always true. Indeed, in the majority of cases\nthey are untrue, and in some instances they are directly contrary to\nhistorical truth. You see that this discovery, as no other, serves\neither to discredit the analysis which has led to such a result, or to\ndiscredit the patients upon whose testimony the analysis, as well as the\nwhole understanding of neuroses, is built up. In addition there is\nsomething else utterly confusing about it. If the infantile experiences,\nrevealed by analysis, were in every case real, we should have the\nfeeling of walking on sure ground; if they were regularly falsified,\ndisclosed themselves as inventions or phantasies of the patients, we\nshould have to leave this uncertain ground and find a surer footing\nelsewhere. But it is neither the one nor the other, for when we look\ninto the matter we find that the childhood experiences which are\nrecalled or reconstructed in the course of the analysis may in some in\nsome instances be false, in others undeniably true, and in the majority\nof cases a mixture of truth and fiction. The symptoms then are either\nthe representation of actual experiences to which we may ascribe an\ninfluence in the fixation of the libido, or the representation of\nphantasies of the patient which, of course, can be of no etiological\nsignificance. It is hard to find one's way here. The first foothold is\ngiven perhaps by an analogous discovery, namely, that the same scattered\nchildhood memories that individuals always have had and have been\nconscious of prior to an analysis may be falsified as well, or at least\nmay contain a generous mixture of true and false. Evidence of error very\nseldom offers difficulties, and we at least gain the satisfaction of\nknowing that the blame for this unexpected disappointment is not to be\nlaid at the door of analysis, but in some way upon the patients.\nAfter reflecting a bit we can easily understand what is so confusing in\nthis matter. It is the slight regard for reality, the neglect to keep\nfact distinct from phantasy. We are apt to feel insulted that the\npatient has wasted our time with invented tales. There is an enormous\ngap in our thinking between reality and invention and we accord an\nentirely different valuation to reality. The patient, too, takes this\nsame viewpoint in his normal thinking. When he offers the material\nwhich, by way of the symptom, leads back to the wish situations which\nare modeled upon the childhood experiences, we are at first, to be sure,\nin doubt whether we are dealing with reality or with phantasy. Later\ncertain traits determine this decision; we are confronted with the task\nof acquainting the patient with them. This can never be accomplished\nwithout difficulty. If at the outset we tell him that he is going to\nreveal phantasies with which he has veiled his childhood history, just\nas every people weaves myths around its antiquity, we notice (to our\ncomfort) that his interest in the further pursuit of the subject\nsuddenly diminishes. He, too, wants to discover realities, and despises\nall \"notions.\" But if until this is accomplished we allow him to believe\nthat we are investigating the actual occurrences of his childhood, we\nrun the risk of later being charged with error and with our apparent\ngullibility. For a long time he is unable to reconcile himself to the\nidea of considering phantasy and reality on equal terms and he tends,\nwith reference to the childish experiences to be explained, to neglect\nfor the time being the difference between the real and the imaginary.\nAnd yet this is obviously the only correct attitude toward these\npsychological products because they are, in a sense, real. It is a fact\nthat the patient is able to create such phantasies for himself, and this\nis of scarcely less importance for his neurosis than if he had really\nundergone the experience which he imagines. These phantasies possess\n_psychological_ reality in contrast to _physical_ reality, and so we\ngradually come to understand that _in the realm of neuroses the\npsychological reality is the determining factor_.\nAmong the experiences which recur continually in the early history of\nneurotics and, in fact, are never lacking, some are of particular\nsignificance and accordingly I consider them worthy of special\ntreatment. I shall enumerate a few examples of this species: observation\nof the parental intercourse, seduction by an adult, and the threat of\ncastration. It would be a grievous error to assume that physical reality\ncan never be accorded them; this may often be proved beyond doubt by the\ntestimony of adult relatives. So, for example, it is not at all unusual\nif the little boy who begins to play with his penis, and does not yet\nknow that one must conceal this, is threatened by his parents or nurse\nwith the cutting off of the organ or the guilty hand. Parents often\nadmit upon questioning that they thought they had done the right thing\nby this intimidation; many individuals retain a correct, conscious\nmemory of these threats, especially if it has occurred in later\nchildhood. When the mother or some other woman makes the threat she\nusually delegates the responsibility of executing it to the father or to\nthe doctor. In the famous _Struwelpeter_ by the pediatrist Hoffman, of\nFrankfort, rhymes which owe their popularity to his very fine\nunderstanding of the sexual and other complexes of childhood, you find a\nmilder substitute for castration in the cutting off of the thumbs as a\npunishment for insistent sucking. But it is highly improbable that the\nthreat of castration is actually made as often as it occurs in the\nanalyses of neurotics. We are content to understand that the child\nimaginatively constructs this threat for himself from suggestions, from\nthe knowledge that auto-erotic satisfaction is forbidden, and from the\nimpression of castration he has received in discovering the female\ngenital. It is, moreover, in no way impossible that the little child, so\nlong as he is not credited with any understanding or memory, will, even\nin families outside the proletariat, become a witness to the sexual act\nbetween his parents or some other group-ups, and it cannot be disproved\nthat the child _subsequently_ understands this impression, and may react\nupon it. But when this intercourse is described with minute details\nwhich could hardly have been observed, or if it turns out to be, as it\nso frequently does, an intercourse which was not face to face, _more\nferarum_, there is no longer any doubt that this phantasy is derived\nfrom the observation of the intercourse of animals (dogs) and the\nunsatisfied curiosity of the child in his period of puberty. The\ngreatest feat of the imagination is the phantasy of having witnessed the\ncoitus of the parents while still unborn in the mother's womb. Of\nespecial interest is the phantasy of having been seduced, because so\noften it is not a phantasy at all, but a real memory. But luckily it is\nnot real so often as first appears from the results of analysis.\nSeduction by older children, or children of the same age, is much more\nfrequent than seduction by adults, and if, in the case of little girls,\nthe father quite regularly appears as the seducer in the occurrences\nwhich they relate, neither the fantastic nature of this accusation nor\nits motive can be doubted. The child as a rule covers the autoerotic\nperiod of his sexual activity, where there has been no actual seduction,\nwith the seduction-phantasy. He spares himself the shame of onanism by\nimagining the presence of an object for his desires in that early\nperiod. As a matter of fact, you must not be misled in attributing\nsexual misuse of the child by its nearest male relatives solely and\nalways to phantasy. Most analysts have probably treated cases in which\nsuch relations were real and could be proved beyond doubt, with the\nqualification that in such cases they belong to the later years of\nchildhood and were transposed to an earlier time.\nWe cannot avoid the impression that such experiences of childhood are in\nsome way necessary to the neurosis, that they are claimed by its iron\nrule. If they exist in reality, then well and good, but if reality has\nwithheld them they are constructed from suggestions and supplemented by\nthe imagination. The result is the same, and to this day we have been\nunable to trace any difference in the results, whether fancy or fact\nplayed the larger part in these childish occurrences. Here again we\nencounter one of the complementary relationships so frequently met with;\nit is, to be sure, the most estranging of all those we have become\nacquainted with. Whence comes the need for these phantasies, and the\nmaterial for them? There can be no doubt as to the sources of the\nimpulse, but we must explain why the same phantasies are always created\nwith the same content. I have an answer in readiness which I know you\nwill think very far-fetched. I am of the opinion that these _primal\nphantasies_--so I should like to term these, and certainly some others\nalso--are a phylogenetic possession. In them the individual reaches out\nbeyond his own life, into the experiences of antiquity, where his own\nexperience has become all too rudimentary. It seems very possible to me\nthat everything which is obtained during an analysis in the guise of\nphantasy, the seduction of children, the release of sexual excitement by\nwatching parental intercourse, the threat of castration--or rather\ncastration itself--were once realities in the primeval existence of\nmankind and that the imaginative child is merely filling in the gaps of\nindividual truth with prehistoric truth. We have again and again\nsuspected that the psychology of neuroses stores up more of the\nantiquities of human development than all other sources.\nWhat we have just discussed makes it necessary for us to enter further\ninto the origin and significance of that mental activity that is called\nimagination. As you well know, it enjoys universal esteem, although we\nhave never clearly understood its place in the psychic life. I have this\nmuch to say about it. As you know, the ego of man is slowly educated by\nthe influence of external necessity to an appreciation of reality and a\npursuit of the principle of reality, and must therefore renounce\ntemporarily or permanently various objects and goals of its strivings\nfor satisfaction, sexual and otherwise. But renunciation of\ngratification has always been difficult for man. He cannot accomplish it\nwithout something in the nature of compensation. Accordingly he has\nreserved for himself a psychological activity wherein all these\nabandoned sources of pleasures and means of pleasurable gratification\nare granted a further existence, a form of existence in which they are\nfreed from the requirements of reality and what we like to call the test\nof reality. Every impulse is soon transformed into the form of its own\nfulfillment. There is no doubt that dwelling on the imagined fulfillment\nof a given wish affords some satisfaction, although the realization that\nit is unreal is unobscured. In the activity of the imagination, man\nenjoys that freedom from external compulsion that he has long since\nrenounced. He has made it possible to be alternately a pleasure-seeking\nanimal and a reasoning human being. He finds that the scant satisfaction\nthat he can force out of reality is not enough. \"There is no getting\nalong without auxiliary-constructions,\" Th. Fontaine once said. The\ncreation of the psychic realm of fancy has its complete counterpart in\nthe establishment of \"preserves\" and \"conservation projects\" in those\nplaces where the demands of husbandry, traffic and industry threaten\nquickly to change the original face of the earth into something\nunrecognizable. The national reserves maintain this old condition of\nthings, which otherwise has everywhere been regretfully sacrificed to\nnecessity. Everything may grow and spread there as it will, even that\nwhich is useless and harmful. The psychic realm of phantasy is such a\nreservation withdrawn from the principles of reality.\nThe best known productions of phantasy are the so-called \"day dreams,\"\nwhich we already know, pictured satisfactions of ambitious, of covetous\nand erotic wishes, which flourish the more grandly the more reality\nadmonishes them to modesty and patience. There is unmistakably shown in\nthem the nature of imaginative happiness, the restoration of the\nindependence of pleasurable gratification from the acquiescence of\nreality. We know such day dreams are nuclei and models for the dreams of\nnight. The night dream is essentially nothing but a day dream, distorted\nby the nocturnal forms of psychological activity, and made available by\nthe freedom which the night gives to instinctive impulses. We have\nalready become acquainted with the idea that a day dream is not\nnecessarily conscious, that there are also unconscious day dreams. Such\nunconscious day dreams are as much the source of night dreams as of\nneurotic symptoms.\nThe significance of phantasy for the development of symptoms will become\nclear to you by the following: We have said that in a case of\nrenunciation, the libido occupies regressively the positions once\nabandoned by it, to which, nevertheless, it has clung in certain ways.\nWe shall neither retract this statement nor correct it, but we shall\ninsert a missing link. How does the libido find its way to these points\nof fixation? Well, every object and tendency of the libido that has been\nabandoned, is not abandoned in every sense of the word. They, or their\nderivatives, are still held in presentations of the phantasy, with a\ncertain degree of intensity. The libido need only retire to the\nimagination in order to find from them the open road to all suppressed\nfixations. These phantasies were happy under a sort of tolerance, there\nwas no conflict between them and the ego, no matter how acute the\ncontrast, so long as a certain condition was observed--a condition\n_quantitative_ in nature that is now disturbed by the flowing back of\nthe libido to the phantasies. By this addition the accumulation of\nenergy in the phantasies is heightened to such a degree that they become\nassertive and develop a pressure in the direction of realization. But\nthat makes a conflict between them and the ego inevitable. Whether\nformerly conscious or unconscious, they now are subject to suppression\nby the ego and are victims to the attraction of the unconscious. The\nlibido wanders from phantasies now unconscious to their sources in\nunconsciousness, and back to its own points of fixation.\nThe return of the libido to phantasy is an intermediate step on the road\nto symptom development and well deserves a special designation. C. G.\nJung coined for it the very appropriate name of _introversion_, but\ninappropriately he also lets it stand for other things. Let us therefore\nretain the idea that introversion signifies the turning aside of the\nlibido from the possibilities of actual satisfaction and the excessive\naccumulation of the phantasies hitherto tolerated as harmless. An\nintrovert is not yet a neurotic, but he finds himself in a labile\nsituation; he must develop symptoms at the next dislocation of forces,\nif he does not find other outlets for his pent-up libido. The intangible\nnature of neurotic satisfaction and the neglect of the difference\nbetween imagination and reality are already determined by arrest in the\nphase of introversion.\nYou have certainly noticed that in the last discussions I have\nintroduced a new factor into the structure of the etiological chain,\nnamely, the quantity, the amount of energy that comes under\nconsideration. We must always take this factor into account. Purely\nqualitative analysis of the etiological conditions is not sufficient.\nOr, to put it in another way, a _dynamic_ conception alone of these\npsychic processes is not enough; there is need of an _economic_\nviewpoint. We must say to ourselves that the conflict between two\nimpulses is not released before certain occupation-intensities have been\nreached, even though the qualitative conditions have long been potent.\nSimilarly, the pathogenic significance of the constitutional factors is\nguided by how much _more_ of a given component impulse is present in the\npredisposition over and above that of another; one can even conceive the\npredispositions of all men to be qualitatively the same and to be\ndifferentiated only by these quantitative conditions. The quantitative\nfactor is no less important for the power of resistance against neurotic\nailments. It depends upon _what amount_ of unused libido a person can\nhold freely suspended, and upon _how large a fraction_ of the libido he\nis able to direct from the sexual path to the goal of sublimation. The\nfinal goal of psychological activity, which may be described\nqualitatively as striving towards pleasure-acquisition and avoidance of\nunpleasantness, presents itself in the light of economic considerations\nas the task of overcoming the gigantic stimuli at work in the\npsychological apparatus, and to prevent those obstructions which cause\nunpleasantness.\nSo much I wanted to tell you about symptom development in the neuroses.\nYes, but do not let me neglect to emphasize this especially: everything\nI have said here relates to the symptom development in hysteria. Even in\ncompulsion neuroses, which retain the same fundamentals, much is found\nthat is different. The counter-siege directed against the claims of the\ninstincts, of which we have spoken in connection with hysteria, press to\nthe fore in compulsion neuroses, and control the clinical picture by\nmeans of so-called \"reaction-formations.\" The same kind and more\nfar-reaching variations are discoverable among the other neuroses, where\nthe investigations as to the mechanism of symptom development have in no\nway been completed.\nBefore I leave you today I should like to have your attention for a\nwhile for an aspect of imaginative life which is worthy of the most\ngeneral interest. For there is a way back from imagination to reality\nand that is--art. The artist is an incipient introvert who is not far\nfrom being a neurotic. He is impelled by too powerful instinctive needs.\nHe wants to achieve honor, power, riches, fame and the love of women.\nBut he lacks the means of achieving these satisfactions. So like any\nother unsatisfied person, he turns away from reality, and transfers all\nhis interests, his libido, too, to the elaboration of his imaginary\nwishes, all of which might easily point the way to neurosis. A great\nmany factors must combine to present this termination of his\ndevelopment; it is well known how often artists especially suffer from a\npartial inhibition of their capacities through neurosis. Apparently\ntheir constitutions are strongly endowed with an ability to sublimize\nand to shift the suppression determining their conflicts. The artist\nfinds the way back to reality in this way. He is not the only one who\nhas a life of imagination. The twilight-realm of phantasy is upheld by\nthe sanction of humanity and every hungry soul looks here for help and\nsympathy. But for those who are not artists, the ability to obtain\nsatisfaction from imaginative sources is very restricted. Their\nrelentless suppressions force them to be satisfied with the sparse day\ndreams which may become conscious. If one is a real artist he has more\nat his disposal. In the first place, he understands how to elaborate his\nday dreams so that they lose their essentially personal element, which\nwould repel strangers, and yield satisfaction to others as well. He also\nknows how to disguise them so that they do not easily disclose their\norigin in their despised sources. He further possesses the puzzling\nability of molding a specific material into a faithful image of the\ncreatures of his imagination, and then he is able to attach to this\nrepresentation of his unconscious phantasies so much pleasurable\ngratification that, for a time at least, it is able to outweigh and\nrelease the suppressions. If he is able to accomplish all this, he makes\nit possible for others, in their return, to obtain solace and\nconsolation from their own unconscious sources of gratification which\nhad become inaccessible. He wins gratitude and admiration for himself\nand so, by means of his imagination, achieves the very things which had\nat first only an imaginary existence for him: honor, power, and the love\nof women.\nTWENTY-FOURTH LECTURE\nGENERAL THEORY OF THE NEUROSES\n_Ordinary Nervousness_\nIn our last discussion we accomplish a difficult task. Now I shall\ntemporarily leave our subject and address myself to you.\nFor I know quite well that you are dissatisfied. You thought that an\nintroduction to psychoanalysis would be quite a different matter. You\nexpected to hear vivid illustrations instead of theories. You will tell\nme that when I gave you the illustration of \"on the ground floor in the\nfirst story,\" you had grasped something of the causation of neurosis,\nonly of course this should have been a real observation and not an\nimaginary story. Or, when in the beginning I described two symptoms (not\nimaginary also, let us hope) whose analysis revealed a close connection\nwith the life of the patient, you first came to grasp the meaning of the\nsymptoms and you hoped that I would proceed in the same way. Instead I\nhave given you theories--lengthy, difficult to see in perspective and\nincomplete, to which something new was constantly being added. I worked\nwith conceptions that I had not previously presented to you, abandoned\ndescriptive for dynamic conceptions, and these in turn for economic\nones. I made it hard for you to understand how many of the artificial\nterms I made use of still carry the same meaning and are used\ninterchangeably only for the sake of euphony. Finally, I allowed broad\nconceptions to pass in review before you: the principles of pleasure and\nof fact and their phylogenetically inherited possession; and then,\ninstead of introducing you to definite facts, I allowed them to become\nincreasingly vague till they seemed to fade into dim distances.\nWhy did I not begin my introduction to the theory of neurosis with the\nfacts that you yourselves know about nervousness, with something that\nhas always aroused your interest, with the peculiar temperament of\nnervous people, their incomprehensible reactions to external influences,\nto human intercourse, their irritability, their uselessness? Why did I\nnot lead you step by step from the understanding of simple, everyday\nforms to the problems of mysterious and extreme manifestations of\nnervousness?\nI cannot even say that you are wrong. I am not so infatuated with my art\nof representation as to see some special attraction in every blemish. I\nmyself believe that I could have proceeded differently, to your better\nadvantage, and this indeed had been my intention. But one cannot always\ncarry out one's sensible intentions. The nature of the subject matter\nissues its own commands, and easily modifies our plans. Even so usual a\nperformance as the organization of well-known material is not entirely\nsubject to the particular purposes of the author. It forms itself as it\nwill and later one wonders why it turned out so and not otherwise.\nProbably one of the reasons is that the title, _A General Introduction\nto Psychoanalysis_, no longer applies to this part, which deals with the\nneuroses. The introduction to psychoanalysis is found in the study of\nerrors and the dream; the theory of neurosis is psychoanalysis itself. I\ndo not think that in so short a time I could have given you a knowledge\nof the theory of neurosis other than in concentrated form. It was\nnecessary to present to you connectedly the meaning and interpretation\nof the symptoms, their external and internal conditions and their\nbearing on the mechanism of symptom formation. This I have attempted to\ndo; it is practically the nucleus of the material that modern\npsychoanalysis is able to offer. We had to say quite a good deal\nconcerning the libido and its development, and something as well\nconcerning the development of the ego. The introduction had already\nprepared you for the presuppositions of our technique, for the large\naspects of the unconscious and of suppression (resistance). In a\nsubsequent lecture you will learn from what points psychoanalysis\nproceeds organically. For the present I have not sought to hide from you\nthe fact that all our results are based on the study of a single group\nof nervous affections, the so-called transference neuroses. Though you\nhave gained no positive knowledge and have not retained every detail,\nstill I hope that you have a fair picture of the methods, the problems\nand the results of psychoanalysis.\nI have assumed that it was your wish for me to begin my presentation of\nneuroses with a description of nervous behavior, the nature of neurotic\nsuffering, and the way in which the nervous meet the conditions of their\nillness and adapt themselves to these. Such subject matter is certainly\ninteresting and well worth knowing. It is moreover not very hard to\nhandle, yet it is not wise to begin with its consideration. There is\ndanger of not discovering the unconscious, of overlooking the great\nsignificance of the libido, of judging all conditions as they appear to\nthe ego of the nervous person. It is obvious that this ego is neither a\nreliable nor an impartial authority. For this very ego is the force that\ndenies and suppresses the unconscious; when the unconscious is\nconcerned, how then could we expect justice to be done? The rejected\nclaims of sexuality stand first in the line of these suppressions; it is\nnatural that from the standpoint of the ego we can never learn their\nextent and significance. As soon as we attain to the point of view of\nsuppression, we are sufficiently warned not to make one of the\ncontending factions, above all not to make the victor judge of the\nstruggle. We are prepared to find that the testimony of the ego may lead\nus astray. If one is to believe the evidence of the ego, it would appear\nto have been active all along, all its symptoms would have been actively\nwilled and formed. Yet we know that it has passively allowed a great\ndeal to occur, a fact which it subsequently seeks to conceal and to\npalliate. To be sure, it does not always attempt this; in the case of\nthe symptoms of compulsion neurosis it must admit that it is being\nopposed by something alien, which it can resist only with difficulty.\nWhoever does not heed these warnings not to mistake the prevarications\nof the ego for truth, has clear sailing; he avoids all the resistances\nwhich oppose the psychoanalytic emphasis upon the unconscious, on\nsexuality, and on the passiveness of the ego. He will assert with Alfred\nAdler that the \"nervous character\" is the cause instead of the result of\nthe neurosis, but he will not be able to explain a single detail of\nsymptom formation or to interpret a single dream.\nYou will ask: Is it not possible to do justice to the part the ego plays\nin nervousness and in symptom formation without crudely neglecting the\nfactors revealed by psychoanalysis? I answer you: Surely it must be\npossible and at some time or other it will take place; but the methods\nby which we organize the work of psychoanalysis do not favor our\nbeginning with just this task. We can foresee the time when this task\nwill claim the attention of psychoanalysis. There are forms of neuroses,\nthe so-called narcistic neuroses, in which the ego is far more deeply\ninvolved than in anything we have studied heretofore. The analytic\ninvestigation of these conditions will enable us to judge reliably and\nimpartially the part that the ego plays in neurotic illness.\nOne of the relations which the ego bears to its neurosis is so obvious\nthat it must be considered at the very outset. In no case does it seem\nto be absent, and it is most clearly recognizable in the traumatic\nneuroses, conditions which we do not as yet clearly understand. You must\nknow that in the causation and mechanisms of all possible forms of\nneurosis, the same factors are active again and again; it is only the\nemphasis that is shifted from one to the other of these factors in\nsymptom formation. The members of a company of actors each have certain\nparts to play--hero, villain, confidant, etc.--yet each will select a\ndifferent drama for his benefit. Thus the phantasies which undergo\nconversion into symptoms are especially easy to detect in hysteria;\ncompulsion neuroses are essentially dominated by the reactionary\nformations, or counter-seizures of the ego; what we designate as\n_secondary elaboration_ in dreams dominates paranoia in the form of\ndelusions, etc.\nIn traumatic neuroses, particularly if they are caused by the horrors of\nwar, we are especially impressed by a selfish ego-impulse which seeks\nprotection and personal advantage. This in itself is not a sufficient\ncause for illness, but it can favor its beginning and also feed its\nneeds once it has been established. This motive serves to protect the\nego from the dangers whose imminence precipitated the disease, and does\nnot permit convalescence until the recurrence of these dangers seems\nimpossible, or until compensation has been obtained for the danger that\nhas been undergone.\nBut the ego betrays similar interest in the origin and maintenance of\nall other neuroses. We have already said that the ego suffers the\nsymptom to exist, because one of its phases gratifies the egoistic\ntendency toward suppression. Besides, the ending of the conflict by\nmeans of symptom development is the path of least resistance, and a\nmost convenient solution for the principle of pleasure. Through symptom\nformation the ego is undoubtedly spared a severe and unpleasant inner\ntask. There are cases where even the physician must admit that the\nresolution of the conflict into neurosis is the most harmless outcome\nand one most easily tolerated by society. Do not be surprised, then, to\nlearn that occasionally even the physician takes the part of the illness\nhe is battling against. He does not have to restrict himself to the role\nof the fanatic warrior for health in all situations of life. He knows\nthat the world contains not only neurotic misery, but also real,\nincurable suffering. He knows that necessity may even require a human\nbeing to sacrifice his health, and he learns that by this sacrifice on\nthe part of one individual untold wretchedness may be spared for many\nothers. So if we say that the neurotic escapes the conflict _by taking\nrefuge in illness_, we must admit that in some cases this escape is\njustifiable, and the physician who has diagnosed the state of affairs\nwill retire silently and tactfully.\nBut let us not consider these special cases in our further discussion.\nIn average cases the ego, by having recourse to neurosis, obtains a\ncertain inner _advantage from the disease_. Under certain conditions of\nlife, there may also be derived a tangible external advantage, more or\nless valuable in reality. Let me direct your attention to the most\nfrequent occurrences of this sort. Women who are brutally treated and\nmercilessly exploited by their husbands almost always adopt the evasion\nof the neurosis, provided that their predisposition permits this. This\nusually follows when the woman is too cowardly or too virtuous to seek\nsecret solace in the arms of another, or when she dare not separate from\nher husband in the face of all opposition, when she has no prospect of\nmaintaining herself or of finding a better husband and especially when\nher sexual emotions still bind her to this brutal man. Her illness\nbecomes a weapon in her struggle with him, one that she can use for\nself-protection and misuse for purposes of vengeance. She probably dare\nnot complain of her marriage, but she can complain of her illness. The\ndoctor becomes her assistant. She forces her inconsiderate husband to\nspare her, to attend to her wishes, to permit her absence from the house\nand thus free her from the oppressions of her married life. Wherever\nsuch external or accidental gain through illness is considerable and\ncan find no substitute in fact, you can prophesy that the possibility of\ninfluencing neurosis through therapy is very slight.\nYou will tell me that what I have said about the advantage gained from\nthe disease speaks entirely for the hypothesis I have rejected, namely,\nthat the ego itself wills and creates the neurosis. Just a moment! It\nprobably does not mean more than that the ego passively suffers the\nneurosis to exist, which it is unable to prevent anyway. It makes the\nmost of the neurosis, if anything can be made of it at all. This is only\none side of the question, the advantageous side. The ego is willing to\nendure the advantages of the neurosis, but there are not only\nadvantages. As a rule it soon appears that the ego has made a poor deal\nin accepting the neurosis. It has paid too high a price for the\nmitigation of the conflict; and the sensations of suffering which the\nsymptoms bring with them are perhaps every bit as bad as the agonies of\nconflict, usually they cause even greater discomfort. The ego wants to\nrid itself of the pain of the symptoms without relinquishing the gain of\nillness, and that is impossible. Thus the ego is discovered as by no\nmeans so active as it had thought itself to be, and this we want to keep\nin mind.\nIf you were to come into contact with neurotics as a physician, you\nwould soon cease to expect that those who complain most woefully of\ntheir illness are the ones who will oppose its therapy with the least\nresistance or who will welcome any help. On the contrary, you would\nreadily understand that everything contributing to the advantage derived\nfrom the disease will strengthen the resistance to the suppression and\nheighten the difficulty of the therapy. We must also add another and\nlater advantage to the gain of illness which is born with the symptom.\nIf a psychic organization, such as this illness, has persisted for a\nlong time, it finally behaves as an independent unit, it expresses\nsomething like self-preservation, attains a kind of _modus vivendi_\nbetween itself and other parts of psychic life, even those that are\nfundamentally hostile to it. And occasions will probably arise where it\ncan prove again to be both useful and valuable, by which it will attain\na _secondary function_, which gives strength to its existence. Instead\nof an illustration from pathology take a striking example from everyday\nlife. An efficient workman who earns his living is crippled for his\noccupation by some disaster; his work is over for him. After a while,\nhowever, he receives a small accident insurance, and learns to exploit\nhis injury by begging. His new existence, though most undesirable, is\nbased upon the very thing that robbed him of his former maintenance. If\nyou could cure his defect, he would be without a means of subsistence,\nhe would have no livelihood. The question would arise: Is he capable of\nresuming his former work? That which corresponds to such secondary\nexploitation of illness in neurosis we may add to the primary benefit\nderived therefrom and may term it a _secondary_ advantage of disease.\nIn general I should like to warn you not to underestimate the practical\nsignificance of the advantage from illness and yet not to be too much\nimpressed by it theoretically. Aside from the previously recognized\nexceptions, I am always reminded of Oberlaender's pictures on \"the\nintelligence of animals\" which appeared in the _Fliegende Blaetter_. An\nArab is riding a camel on a narrow path cut through a steep mountain\nside. At a turn of the trail he is suddenly confronted by a lion who\nmakes ready to spring. He sees no way out, on one side the precipice, on\nthe other the abyss; retreat and flight--both are impossible; he gives\nhimself up as lost. Not so the camel. He leaps into the abyss with his\nrider--and the lion is left in the lurch. The help of neurosis is as a\nrule no kinder to the rider. It may be due to the fact that the\nsettlement of the conflict through symptom development is nevertheless\nan automatic process, not able to meet the demands of life, and for\nwhose sake man renounces the use of his best and loftiest powers. If it\nwere possible to choose, it were indeed best to perish in an honorable\nstruggle with destiny.\nI still owe you further explanation as to why, in my presentation of the\ntheory of neurosis, I did not proceed from ordinary nervousness as a\nstarting point. You may assume that, had I done this, the proof of the\nsexual origin of neurosis would have been more difficult for me, and so\nI refrained. There you are mistaken. In transference neurosis we must\nwork at interpretations of the symptoms to arrive at this conclusion. In\nthe ordinary forms of the so-called true neuroses, however, the\netiological significance of sexual life is a crude fact open to\nobservation. I discovered it twenty years ago when I asked myself one\nday why we regularly barred out questions concerning sexual activity in\nexamining nervous patients. At that time I sacrificed my popularity\namong my patients to my investigations, yet after a brief effort I could\nstate that no neurosis, no true neurosis at least, is present with a\nnormal sexual life. Of course, this statement passes too lightly over\nthe individual differences, it is unclear through the vagueness with\nwhich it uses the term \"normal,\" but even to-day it retains its value\nfor purposes of rough orientation. At that time I reached the point of\ndrawing comparisons between certain forms of nervousness and sexual\nabnormalities, and I do not doubt that I could repeat the same\nobservations now, if similar material were at my disposal. I frequently\nnoticed that a man who contented himself with incomplete sexual\ngratification, with manual ononism, for instance, would suffer from a\ntrue neurosis, and that this neurosis would promptly give way to another\nform, if another sexual regime no less harmful were substituted. From\nthe change in the condition of the patient I was able to guess the\nchange in the mode of his sexual life. At that time I learned to hold\nobstinately to my conjectures until I had overcome the patient's\nprevarications and had forced him to confirm my suppositions. To be\nsure, then he preferred to consult other physicians who did not inquire\nso insistently into his sexual life.\nAt that time it did not escape my notice that the origin of the disease\ncould not always be traced back to sexual life; sexual abnormality would\ncause the illness in one person, while another would fall ill because he\nhad lost his fortune or had suffered an exhausting organic disease. We\ngained insight into this variation by means of the interrelations\nbetween the ego and the libido, and the more profound our insight\nbecame, the more satisfactory were the results. A person begins to\nsuffer from neurosis when his ego has lost the capacity of accommodating\nthe libido. The stronger the ego, the easier the solution of the\nproblem; a weakening of the ego from any cause whatsoever has the same\neffect as a superlative increase of the claims of the libido. There are\nother and more intimate relations between the ego and the libido which I\nshall not discuss, as we are not concerned with them here. To us it is\nof enlightening significance that in every case, regardless of the way\nin which the illness was caused, the symptoms of neurosis were opposed\nby the libido and thus gave evidence for its abnormal use.\nNow, however, I want to draw your attention to the difference between\nthe symptoms of the true neuroses and the psychoneuroses, the first\ngroup of which, the transference neurosis, has occupied us considerably.\nIn both cases the symptoms proceed from the libido. They are accordingly\nabnormal uses of it, substitutes for gratification. But the symptoms of\nthe true neurosis--such as pressure in the head, sensations of pain,\nirritability of an organ, weakening or inhibition of a function--these\nhave no meaning, no psychic significance. They are manifested not only\nin the body, as for instance hysteric symptoms, but are in themselves\nphysical processes whose creation is devoid of all the complicated\npsychic mechanism with which we have become acquainted. They really\nembody the character that has so long been attributed to the\npsychoneurotic symptom. But how can they then correspond to uses of the\nlibido, which we have come to know as a psychological force? That is\nquite simple. Let me recall one of the very first objections that was\nmade to psychoanalysis. It was stated that psychoanalysis was concerned\nwith a purely psychological theory of neurotic manifestations; that this\nwas a hopeless outlook since psychological theories could never explain\nillness. The objectors chose to forget that the sexual function is\nneither purely psychic nor merely somatic. It influences physical as\nwell as psychic life. In the symptoms of the psychoneuroses we have\nrecognized the expression of a disturbance in psychic processes. And so\nwe shall not be surprised to discover that the true neuroses are the\ndirect somatic consequences of sexual disturbances.\nThe medical clinic gives us a valuable suggestion (observed by many\nresearch workers) for the comprehension of the true neuroses. In all the\ndetails of their symptomatology, and as well in their characteristic\npower to influence all organic systems and all functions, the true\nneuroses reveal a marked similarity to the conditions of those diseases\nwhich originate through the chronic influence of foreign poisons and as\nwell through their acute diminution; with conditions prevalent in\nintoxication and abstinence. The two groups of conditions are brought\nstill closer together by the relation of intermediate conditions, which,\nfollowing M. Basedowi, we have learned to attribute to the influence of\ntoxic substances, but of toxins, however, which are not introduced into\nthe body from without, but arise in its own metabolism. These analogies,\nI think, lead us directly to the consideration of these neuroses as\ndisturbances in sexual metabolism. It may be that more sexual toxins are\nproduced than the individual can dispose of, or that inner, even psychic\nconditions, stand in the way of the proper elaboration of these\nsubstances. The language of the people has always favored such\nassumptions as to the nature of sexual desires. It calls love an\n\"intoxication\"; it will have love-madness aroused through potions, and\nthus sees the motive force removed, as it were, to the outer world. For\nthe rest, the phrase \"sexual metabolism\" or \"chemism of sexuality\" is a\nchapter-head without content. We know nothing about it and cannot even\ndecide whether we are to assume two sexual substances, the male and the\nfemale, or, if there is only _one_ sexual toxin, which to consider the\ncarrier of all the stimulating power of the libido. The structure of\npsychoanalysis that we have erected is really only a superstructure\nwhich at some future time must be placed upon its organic foundation;\nbut what this is we do not know as yet.\nPsychoanalysis is characterized as a science, not by reason of the\nsubject matter it handles but by the technique it employs. This can be\nemployed in dealing with the history of civilization, the science of\nreligion or mythology, as well as with the theory of neurosis, without\naltering its character. The revealing of the unconscious in psychic life\nis all it aims to accomplish. The problems of the true neuroses, whose\nsymptoms probably originate in direct toxic damage, yield no point of\nattack to psychoanalysis. Psychoanalysis can do little for their\nelucidation, and must leave the task to biological-medical research.\nPerhaps you understand now why I did not choose to organize my material\ndifferently. If I had given to you an _Introduction to the Theory of the\nNeuroses_ as you wished, it would unquestionably have been correct to\nproceed from the simple forms of the true neuroses to those complex\nillnesses caused by a disturbance of the libido. In discussing the true\nneuroses I would have had to bring together the facts we have gleaned\nfrom various quarters and present what we think we know of them. Only\nlater, under the psychoneuroses, would psychoanalysis have been\ndiscussed as the most important technical aid for insight into these\nconditions. I had, however, intended and announced _A General\nIntroduction to Psychoanalysis_, and it seemed to me more important to\ngive you an idea of psychoanalysis than to present certain positive\nfacts about neuroses; and so I could not place the true neuroses into\nthe foreground, for they prove sterile for the purposes of\npsychoanalysis. I believe that I have made the wiser choice for you,\nsince psychoanalysis deserves the interest of every educated person\nbecause of its profound hypotheses and far-reaching connections. The\ntheory of neurosis, on the other hand, is a chapter of medicine like any\nother.\nYou are, however, justified in expecting some interest on our part in\nthe true neuroses. Because of their intimate connection with\npsychoneuroses we find this decidedly necessary. I shall tell you then\nthat we distinguish three pure forms of true neuroses: _neurasthenia_,\n_anxiety neurosis_ and _hypochondria_. Even this classification has not\nremained uncontradicted. The terms are all widely used, but their\nconnotation is vague and uncertain. Besides, there are in this world of\nconfusion physicians who object to any distinctions between\nmanifestations, any emphasis of clinical detail, who do not even\nrecognize the separation of true neuroses and psychoneuroses. I think\nthey have gone too far and have not chosen the road which leads to\nprogress. The types of neuroses we have mentioned occur occasionally in\npure form; more often they are blended with one another or with a\npsychoneurotic condition. This need not discourage us to the extent of\nabandoning the task of distinction. Think of the difference between the\nstudy of minerals and that of ores in mineralogy. Minerals are described\nas individuals; frequently of course they occur as crystals, separated\nsharply from their surroundings. Ores consist of an aggregate of\nminerals which have coalesced not accidentally, but as a result of the\nconditions of their origin. We understand too little of the process of\ndevelopment of neuroses, to create anything similar to the study of\nores. But we are surely working in the right direction when we isolate\nthe known clinical factors, comparable to the separate minerals, from\nthe great mass.\nA noteworthy connection between the symptoms of the true neuroses and\nthe psychoneuroses adds a valuable contribution to our knowledge of\nsymptom formation in the latter. The symptom in the true neuroses is\nfrequently the nucleus and incipient stage of development of the\npsychoneurotic symptom. Such a connection is most easily observed\nbetween neurasthenia and the transference neuroses, which are termed\nconversion hysteria, between anxiety neurosis and anxiety hysteria, but\nalso between hypochondria and paraphrenia (dementia praecox and\nparanoia), forms of neuroses of which we shall speak subsequently. Let\nus take as an illustration the hysteric headache or backache. Analysis\nshows that through elaboration and displacement this pain has become the\ngratification substitute for a whole series of libidinous phantasies or\nreminiscences. But once upon a time this pain was real, a direct sexual\ntoxic symptom, the physical expression of libidinous excitation. We do\nnot wish to assert, by any means, that all hysteric symptoms can be\ntraced to such a nucleus, but it is true that this is frequently the\ncase, and that all influences upon the body through libidinous\nexcitation, whether normal or pathological, are especially significant\nfor the symptom development in hysteria. They play the part of the grain\nof sand which the mollusc has enveloped in mother-of-pearl. In the same\nway passing signs of sexual excitation, which accompany the sexual act,\nare used by psychoneurosis as the most convenient and appropriate\nmaterial for symptom formation.\nA similar procedure is of diagnostic and therapeutic interest\nespecially. Persons who are disposed to be neurotic, without suffering\nfrom a flourishing neurosis, frequently set in motion the work of\nsymptom development as the result of an abnormal physical change--often\nan inflammation or an injury. This development rapidly makes the symptom\ngiven by reality the representative of the unconscious phantasies that\nhad been lurking for an opportunity to seize upon a means of expression.\nIn such a case the physician will try different ways of therapy. Either\nhe will try to do away with the organic basis without bothering about\nits noisy neurotic elaboration, or he will struggle with the neurosis\nbrought out by the occasion, and ignore its organic cause. The result\nwill justify now one, now the other method of procedure; no general laws\ncan be laid down for such mixed cases.\nTWENTY-FIFTH LECTURE\nGENERAL THEORY OF THE NEUROSES\n_Fear and Anxiety_\nProbably you will term what I told you about ordinary nervousness in my\nlast lecture most fragmentary and unsatisfactory information. I know\nthis, and I think you were probably most surprised that I did not\nmention fear, which most nervous people complain of and describe as\ntheir greatest source of suffering. It can attain a terrible intensity\nwhich may result in the wildest enterprises. But I do not wish to fall\nshort of your expectations in this matter. I intend, on the contrary, to\ntreat the problem of the fear of nervous people with great accuracy and\nto discuss it with you at some length.\nFear itself needs no introduction; everyone has at some time or other\nknown this sensation or, more precisely, this effect. It seems to me\nthat we never seriously inquired why the nervous suffered so much more\nand so much more intensely under this condition. Perhaps it was thought\na matter of course; it is usual to confuse the words \"nervous\" and\n\"anxious\" as though they meant the same thing. That is unjustifiable;\nthere are anxious people who are not nervous, and nervous people who\nsuffer from many symptoms, but not from the tendency to anxiety.\nHowever that may be, it is certain that the problem of fear is the\nmeeting point of many important questions, an enigma whose complete\nsolution would cast a flood of light upon psychic life. I do not claim\nthat I can furnish you with this complete solution, but you will\ncertainly expect psychoanalysis to deal with this theme in a manner\ndifferent from that of the schools of medicine. These schools seem to be\ninterested primarily in the anatomical cause of the condition of fear.\nThey say the medulla oblongata is irritated, and the patient learns that\nhe is suffering from neurosis of the nervus vague. The medulla\noblongata is a very serious and beautiful object. I remember exactly how\nmuch time and trouble I devoted to the study of it, years ago. But today\nI must say that I know of nothing more indifferent to me for the\npsychological comprehension of fear, than knowledge of the nerve passage\nthrough which these sensations must pass.\nOne can talk about fear for a long time without even touching upon\nnervousness. You will understand me without more ado, when I term this\nfear _real_ fear in contrast to _neurotic_ fear. Real fear seems quite\nrational and comprehensible to us. We may testify that it is a reaction\nto the perception of external danger, viz., harm that is expected and\nforeseen. It is related to the flight reflex and may be regarded as an\nexpression of the instinct of self-preservation. And so the occasions,\nviz., the objects and situations which arouse fear, will depend largely\non our knowledge of and our feeling of power over the outer world. We\ndeem it quite a matter of course that the savage fears a cannon or an\neclipse of the sun, while the white man, who can handle the instrument\nand prophesy the phenomenon, does not fear these things. At other times\nsuperior knowledge promulgates fear, because it recognizes the danger\nearlier. The savage, for instance, will recoil before a footprint in the\nwoods, meaningless to the uninstructed, which reveals to him the\nproximity of an animal of prey; the experienced sailor will notice a\nlittle cloud, which tells him of a coming hurricane, with terror, while\nto the passenger it seems insignificant.\nAfter further consideration, we must say to ourselves that the verdict\non real fear, whether it be rational or purposeful, must be thoroughly\nrevised. For the only purposeful behavior in the face of imminent danger\nwould be the cool appraisal of one's own strength in comparison with the\nextent of the threatening danger, and then decide which would presage a\nhappier ending: flight, defense, or possibly even attack. Under such a\nproceeding fear has absolutely no place; everything that happens would\nbe consummated just as well and better without the development of fear.\nYou know that if fear is too strong, it proves absolutely useless and\nparalyzes every action, even flight. Generally the reaction against\ndanger consists in a mixture of fear and resistance. The frightened\nanimal is afraid and flees. But the purposeful factor in such a case is\nnot fear but flight.\nWe are therefore tempted to claim that the development of fear is never\npurposeful. Perhaps closer examination will give us greater insight into\nthe fear situation. The first factor is the expectancy of danger which\nexpresses itself in heightened sensory attention and in motor tension.\nThis expectancy is undoubtedly advantageous; its absence may be\nresponsible for serious consequences. On the one hand, it gives rise to\nmotor activity, primarily to flight, and on a higher plane to active\ndefense; on the other hand, it gives rise to something which we consider\nthe condition of fear. In so far as the development is still incipient,\nand is restricted to a mere signal, the more undisturbed the conversion\nof the readiness to be afraid into action the more purposeful the entire\nproceeding. The readiness to be afraid seems to be the purposeful\naspect; evolution of fear itself, the element that defeats its own\nobject.\nI avoid entering upon a discussion as to whether our language means the\nsame or distinct things by the words anxiety, fear or fright. I think\nthat anxiety is used in connection with a condition regardless of any\nobjective, while fear is essentially directed toward an object. Fright,\non the other hand, seems really to possess a special meaning, which\nemphasizes the effects of a danger which is precipitated without any\nexpectance or readiness of fear. Thus we might say that anxiety protects\nman from fright.\nYou have probably noticed the ambiguity and vagueness in the use of the\nword \"anxiety.\" Generally one means a subjective condition, caused by\nthe perception that an \"evolution of fear\" has been consummated. Such a\ncondition may be called an emotion. What is an emotion in the dynamic\nsense? Certainly something very complex. An emotion, in the first place,\nincludes indefinite motor innervations or discharges; secondly, definite\nsensations which moreover are of two kinds, the perception of motor\nactivities that have already taken place, and the direct sensations of\npleasure and pain, which give the effect of what we call its feeling\ntone. But I do not think that the true nature of the emotion has been\nfathomed by these enumerations. We have gained deeper insight into some\nemotions and realize that the thread which binds together such a complex\nas we have described is the repetition of a certain significant\nexperience. This experience might be an early impression of a very\ngeneral sort, which belongs to the antecedent history of the species\nrather than to that of the individual. To be more clear: the emotional\ncondition has a structure similar to that of an hysterical attack; it is\nthe upshot of a reminiscence. The hysteric attack, then, is comparable\nto a newly formed individual emotion, the normal emotion to an hysteria\nwhich has become a universal heritage.\nDo not assume that what I have said here about emotions is derived from\nnormal psychology. On the contrary, these are conceptions that have\ngrown up with and are at home only in psychoanalysis. What psychology\nhas to say about emotions--the James-Lange theory, for instance--is\nabsolutely incomprehensible for us psychoanalysts, and cannot be\ndiscussed. Of course, we do not consider our knowledge about emotions\nvery certain; it is a preliminary attempt to become oriented in this\nobscure region. To continue: We believe we know the early impression\nwhich the emotion of fear repeats. We think it is birth itself which\ncombines that complex of painful feelings, of a discharge of impulses,\nof physical sensations, which has become the prototype for the effect of\ndanger to life, and is ever after repeated within us as a condition of\nfear. The tremendous heightening of irritability through the\ninterruption of the circulation (internal respiration) was at the time\nthe cause of the experience of fear; the first fear was therefore toxic.\nThe name anxiety--angustial--narrowness, emphasizes the characteristic\ntightening of the breath, which was at the time a consequence of an\nactual situation and is henceforth repeated almost regularly in the\nemotion. We shall also recognize how significant it is that this first\ncondition of fear appeared during the separation from the mother. Of\ncourse, we are convinced that the tendency to repetition of the first\ncondition of fear has been so deeply ingrained in the organism through\ncountless generations, that not a single individual can escape the\nemotion of fear; not even the mythical Macduff who was \"cut out of his\nmother's womb,\" and therefore did not experience birth itself. We do not\nknow the prototype of the condition of fear in the case of other\nmammals, and so we do not know the complex of emotions that in them is\nthe equivalent of our fear.\nPerhaps it will interest you to hear how the idea that birth is the\nsource and prototype of the emotion of fear, happened to occur to me.\nSpeculation plays the smallest part in it; I borrowed it from the native\ntrain of thought of the people. Many years ago we were sitting around\nthe dinner table--a number of young physicians--when an assistant in the\nobstetrical clinic told a jolly story of what had happened in the last\nexamination for midwives. A candidate was asked what it implied if\nduring delivery the foeces of the newborn was present in the discharge\nof waters, and she answered promptly \"the child is afraid.\" She was\nlaughed at and \"flunked.\" But I silently took her part and began to\nsuspect that the poor woman of the people had, with sound perception,\nrevealed an important connection.\nProceeding now to neurotic fear, what are its manifestations and\nconditions? There is much to be described. In the first place we find a\ngeneral condition of anxiety, a condition of free-floating fear as it\nwere, which is ready to attach itself to any appropriate idea, to\ninfluence judgment, to give rise to expectations, in fact to seize any\nopportunity to make itself felt. We call this condition \"expectant fear\"\nor \"anxious expectation.\" Persons who suffer from this sort of fear\nalways prophesy the most terrible of all possibilities, interpret every\ncoincidence as an evil omen, and ascribe a dreadful meaning to all\nuncertainty. Many persons who cannot be termed ill show this tendency to\nanticipate disaster. We blame them for being over-anxious or\npessimistic. A striking amount of expectant fear is characteristic of a\nnervous condition which I have named \"anxiety neurosis,\" and which I\ngroup with the true neuroses.\nA second form of fear in contrast to the one we have just described is\npsychologically more circumscribed and bound up with certain objects or\nsituations. It is the fear of the manifold and frequently very peculiar\nphobias. Stanley Hall, the distinguished American psychologist, has\nrecently taken the trouble to present a whole series of these phobias in\ngorgeous Greek terminology. They sound like the enumeration of the ten\nEgyptian plagues, except that their number exceeds ten, by far. Just\nlisten to all the things which may become the objects of contents of a\nphobia: Darkness, open air, open squares, cats, spiders, caterpillars,\nsnakes, mice, thunder-storms, sharp points, blood, enclosed spaces,\ncrowds, solitude, passing over a bridge, travel on land and sea, etc. A\nfirst attempt at orientation in this chaos leads readily to a division\ninto three groups. Some of the fearful objects and situations have\nsomething gruesome for normal people too, a relation to danger, and so,\nthough they are exaggerated in intensity, they do not seem\nincomprehensible to us. Most of us, for instance, experience a feeling\nof repulsion in the presence of a snake. One may say that snakephobia is\ncommon to all human beings, and Charles Darwin has described most\nimpressively how he was unable to control his fear of a snake pointing\nfor him, though he knew he was separated from it by a thick pane of\nglass. The second group consists of cases which still bear a relation to\ndanger, but this is of a kind which we are disposed to belittle rather\nthan to overestimate. Most of the situation-phobia belong here. We know\nthat by taking a railroad journey we entail greater chance of disaster\nthan by staying at home. A collision, for instance, may occur, or a ship\nsink, when as a rule we must drown; yet we do not think of these\ndangers, and free from fear we travel on train and boat. We cannot deny\nthat if a bridge should collapse at the moment we are crossing it, we\nwould fall into the river, but that is such a rare occurrence that we do\nnot take the danger into account. Solitude too has its dangers and we\navoid it under certain conditions; but it is by no means a matter of\nbeing unable to suffer it for a single moment. The same is true for the\ncrowd, the enclosed space, the thunder-storm, etc. It is not at all the\ncontent but the intensity of these neurotic phobias that appears strange\nto us. The fear of the phobia cannot even be described. Sometimes we\nalmost receive the impression that the neurotic is not really afraid of\nthe same things and situations that can arouse fear in us, and which he\ncalls by the same name.\nThere remains a third group of phobias which is entirely unintelligible\nto us. When a strong, adult man is afraid to cross a street or a square\nof his own home town, when a healthy, well-developed woman becomes\nalmost senseless with fear because a cat has brushed the hem of her\ndress or a mouse has scurried through the room--how are we to establish\nthe relation to danger that obviously exists under the phobia? In these\nanimal phobias it cannot possibly be a question of the heightening of\ncommon human antipathies. For, as an illustration of the antithesis,\nthere are numerous persons who cannot pass a cat without calling and\npetting it. The mouse of which women are so much afraid, is at the same\ntime a first class pet name. Many a girl who has been gratified to have\nher lover call her so, screams when she sees the cunning little creature\nitself. The behavior of the man who is afraid to cross the street or the\nsquare can only be explained by saying that he acts like a little child.\nA child is really taught to avoid a situation of this sort as dangerous,\nand our agoraphobist is actually relieved of his fear if some one goes\nwith him across the square or street.\nThe two forms of fear that have been described, free-floating fear and\nthe fear which is bound up with phobias, are independent of one another.\nThe one is by no means a higher development of the other; only in\nexceptional cases, almost by accident, do they occur simultaneously. The\nstrongest condition of general anxiety need not manifest itself in\nphobias; and persons whose entire life is hemmed in by agoraphobia can\nbe entirely free of pessimistic expectant fear. Some phobias, such as\nthe fear of squares or of trains, are acquired only in later life, while\nothers, the fear of darkness, storms and animals, exist from the very\nbeginning. The former signify serious illness, the latter appear rather\nas peculiarities, moods. Yet whoever is burdened with fear of this\nsecond kind may be expected to harbor other and similar phobias. I must\nadd that we group all these phobias under _anxiety hysteria_, and\ntherefore regard it as a condition closely related to the well-known\nconversion hysteria.\nThe third form of neurotic fear confronts us with an enigma; we loose\nsight entirely of the connection between fear and threatening danger.\nThis anxiety occurs in hysteria, for instance, as the accompaniment of\nhysteric symptoms, or under certain conditions of excitement, where we\nwould expect an emotional manifestation, but least of all of fear, or\nwithout reference to any known circumstance, unintelligible to us and to\nthe patient. Neither far nor near can we discover a danger or a cause\nwhich might have been exaggerated to such significance. Through these\nspontaneous attacks we learn that the complex which we call the\ncondition of anxiety can be resolved into its components. The whole\nattack may be represented by a single intensively developed symptom,\nsuch as a trembling, dizziness, palpitation of the heart, or tightening\nof breath; the general undertone by which we usually recognize fear may\nbe utterly lacking or vague. And yet these conditions, which we\ndescribe as \"anxiety equivalents,\" are comparable to anxiety in all its\nclinical and etiological relations.\nTwo questions arise. Can we relate neurotic fear, in which danger plays\nso small a part or none at all, to real fear, which is always a reaction\nto danger? And what can we understand as the basis of neurotic fear? For\nthe present we want to hold to our expectations: \"Wherever there is\nfear, there must be a cause for it.\"\nClinical observation yields several suggestions for the comprehension of\nneurotic fear, the significance of which I shall discuss with you.\n1. It is not difficult to determine that expectant fear or general\nanxiety is closely connected with certain processes in sexual life, let\nus say with certain types of libido. Utilization, the simplest and most\ninstructive case of this kind, results when persons expose themselves to\nfrustrated excitation, viz., if their sexual excitation does not meet\nwith sufficient relief and is not brought to a satisfactory conclusion,\nin men, during the time of their engagement to marry, for instance, or\nin women whose husbands are not sufficiently potent or who, from\ncaution, execute the sexual act in a shortened or mutilated form. Under\nthese circumstances libidinous excitement disappears and anxiety takes\nits place, both in the form of expectant fear and in attacks and anxiety\nequivalents. The cautious interruption of the sexual act, when practiced\nas the customary sexual regime, so frequently causes the anxiety\nneurosis in men, and especially in women, that physicians are wise in\nsuch cases to examine primarily this etiology. On innumerable occasions\nwe have learned that anxiety neurosis vanishes when the sexual misuse is\nabandoned.\nSo far as I know, the connection between sexual restraint and conditions\nof anxiety is no longer questioned even by physicians who have nothing\nto do with psychoanalysis. But I can well imagine that they do not\ndesist from reversing the connection and saying that these persons have\nexhibited a tendency to anxiety from the outset and therefore practice\nreserve in sexual matters. The behavior of women whose sexual conduct is\npassive, viz., is determined by the treatment of the husband,\ncontradicts this supposition. The more temperamental, that is, the more\ndisposed toward sexual intercourse and capable of gratification is the\nwoman, the more will she react to the impotence of the man, or to the\n_coitus interruptus_, by anxiety manifestations. In anaesthetic or only\nslightly libidinous women, such misuse will not carry such consequences.\nSexual abstinence, recommended so warmly by the physicians of to-day,\nhas the same significance in the development of conditions of anxiety\nonly when the libido, to which satisfactory relief is denied, is\nsufficiently strong and not for the most part accounted for by\nsublimation. The decision whether illness is to result always depends\nupon the quantitative factors. Even where character formation and not\ndisease is concerned, we easily recognize that sexual constraint goes\nhand in hand with a certain anxiety, a certain caution, while\nfearlessness and bold daring arise from free gratification of sexual\ndesires. However much these relations are altered by various influences\nof civilization, for the average human being it is true that anxiety and\nsexual constraint belong together.\nI have by no means mentioned all the observations that speak for the\ngenetic relation of the libido to fear. The influence on the development\nof neurotic fear of certain phases of life, such as puberty and the\nperiod of menopause, when the production of libido is materially\nheightened, belongs here too. In some conditions of excitement we may\nobserve the mixture of anxiety and libido and the final substitution of\nanxiety for libido. These facts give us a twofold impression, first that\nwe are concerned with an accumulation of libido, which is diverted from\nits normal channel, second that we are working with somatic processes.\nJust how anxiety originates from the libido we do not know; we can only\nascertain that the libido is in abeyance, and that we observe anxiety in\nits place.\n2. We glean a second hint from the analysis of the psychoneuroses,\nespecially of hysteria. We have heard that in addition to the symptoms,\nfear frequently accompanies this condition; this, however, is free\nfloating fear, which is manifested either as an attack or becomes a\npermanent condition. The patients cannot tell what they are afraid of\nand connect their fear, through an unmistakable secondary elaboration,\nwith phobias nearest at hand; death, insanity, paralysis. When we\nanalyze the situation which gave rise to the anxiety or to symptoms\naccompanied by it, we can generally tell which normal psychologic\nprocess has been omitted and has been replaced by the phenomenon of\nfear. Let me express it differently: we reconstruct the unconscious\nprocess as though it had not experienced suppression and had continued\nits way into consciousness uninterruptedly. Under these conditions as\nwell this process would have been accompanied by an emotion, and we now\nlearn with surprise that when suppression has occurred the emotion\naccompanying the normal process has been replaced by fear, regardless of\nits original quality. In hysteric conditions of fear, its unconscious\ncorrelative may be either an impulse of similar character, such as fear,\nshame, embarrassment or positive libidinous excitation, or hostile and\naggressive emotion such as fury or rage. Fear then is the common\ncurrency for which all emotional impulses can be exchanged, provided\nthat the idea with which it has been associated has been subject to\nsuppression.\n3. Patients suffering from compulsive acts are remarkably devoid of\nfear. They yield us the data for our third point. If we try to hinder\nthem in the performance of their compulsive acts, of their washing or\ntheir ceremonials, or if they themselves dare to give up one of their\ncompulsions, they are seized with terrible fear that again exacts\nobedience to the compulsion. We understand that the compulsive act had\nveiled fear and had been performed only to avoid it. In compulsion\nneurosis then, fear, which would otherwise be present, is replaced by\nsymptom development. Similar results are yielded by hysteria. Following\nthe process of suppression we find the development, either of anxiety\nalone or of anxiety and symptom development, or finally a more complete\nsymptom development and no anxiety. In an abstract sense, then, it would\nbe correct to say that symptoms are formed only to evade development of\nfear, which otherwise could not be escaped. According to this\nconception, fear is seen to occupy the center of the stage in the\nproblems of neurosis.\nOur observations on anxiety neuroses led to the conclusion that when the\nlibido was diverted from its normal use and anxiety thus released, it\noccurred on the basis of somatic processes. The analyses of hysteria and\ncompulsion neuroses furnish the correlative observations that similar\ndiversion with similar results may also be the consequence of a\nconstraint of psychic forces. Such then is our knowledge of the origin\nof neurotic fear; it still sounds rather vague. But as yet I know no\npath that would lead us further. The second task we have set ourselves\nis still more difficult to accomplish. It is the establishment of a\nconnection between neurotic fear, which is misused libido, and real\nfear, which is a reaction to danger. You may believe that these things\nare quite distinct and yet we have no criterion for distinguishing the\nsensations of real and neurotic fear.\nThe desired connection is brought about by presupposing the antithesis\nof the ego to libido that is so frequently claimed. We know that the\ndevelopment of fear is the ego's reaction to danger, the signal for\npreparation for flight, and from this we are led to believe that in\nneurotic fear the ego attempts to escape the claims of its libido, and\ntreats this inner danger as though it came from without. Accordingly our\nexpectation that where there is fear there must be something to be\nafraid of, is fulfilled. But the analogy admits of further application.\nJust as the attempt to flee external danger is relieved by standing\none's ground, and by appropriate steps toward defense, so the\ndevelopment of neurotic fear is arrested as fast as the symptom\ndevelops, for by means of it the fear is held in check.\nOur difficulties in understanding now lie elsewhere. The fear, which\nrepresents flight of the ego before the libido, is supposed to have\nsprung from the libido itself. That is obscure and warns us not to\nforget that the libido of a person belongs fundamentally to him and\ncannot confront him as an external force. The localized dynamics of fear\ndevelopment are still unintelligible; we do not know what psychic\nenergies are released or from what psychic systems they are derived. I\ncannot promise to solve this problem, but we still have two trails to\nfollow which lead us to direct observations and analytic investigation\nwhich can aid our speculations. We turn to the origin of fear in the\nchild, and to the source of neurotic fear which attaches itself to\nphobias.\nFear in children is quite common and it is very hard to tell whether it\nis neurotic or real fear. Indeed, the value of this distinction is\nrendered questionable by the behavior of children. On the one hand we\nare not surprised that the child fears all strange persons, new\nsituations and objects, and we explain this reaction very easily by his\nweakness and ignorance. We ascribe to the child a strong disposition to\nreal fear and would consider it purposeful if this fear were in fact a\nheritage. Herein the child would only repeat the behavior of prehistoric\nman and of the primitive man of today who, on account of his ignorance\nand helplessness, fears everything that is new, and much that is\nfamiliar, all of which can no longer inspire us with fear. If the\nphobias of the child were at least partially such as might be attributed\nto that primeval period of human development, this would tally entirely\nwith our expectations.\nOn the other hand, we cannot overlook the fact that not all children are\nequally afraid, and that those very children who express particular\ntimidity toward all possible objects and situations subsequently prove\nto be nervous. Thus the neurotic disposition reveals itself by a decided\ntendency to real fear; anxiety rather than nervousness appears to be\nprimary. We therefore arrive at the conclusion that the child (and later\nthe adult) fears the power of his libido because he is anxious in the\nface of everything. The derivation of anxiety from the libido is hence\nput aside. Any investigation of the conditions of real fear consistently\nleads to the conclusion that consciousness of one's own weakness and\nhelplessness--inferiority, in the terminology of A. Adler--when it is\nable to persist from childhood to maturity, is the cause underlying the\nneuroses.\nThis sounds so simple and convincing that it has a claim upon our\nattention. To be sure, it would result in our shifting the basis of\nnervousness. The persistence of the feeling of inferiority, and its\nprerequisite condition of anxiety and its subsequent development of\nsymptoms, is so firmly established that it is rather the exceptional\ncase, when health is the outcome, which requires an explanation. What\ncan be learned from careful observation of the fear of children? The\nlittle child is primarily afraid of strange people; situations wax\nimportant only because they involve people, and objects become\ninfluential much later. But the child does not fear these strange\npersons because he attributes evil intentions to them, because he\ncompares his weakness with their strength or recognizes them as\ndangerous to his existence, his safety and freedom from pain. Such a\nchild, suspicious, afraid of the aggressive impulse which dominates the\nworld, would prove a sad theoretic construction. The child is afraid of\na stranger because he is adjusted to a dear, beloved person, his\nmother. His disappointment and longing are transformed into fear, his\nunemployed libido, which cannot yet be held suspended, is diverted by\nfear. It cannot be termed a coincidence that this situation, which is a\ntypical example of all childish fear, is a repetition of the first\ncondition of fear during birth, viz., separation from the mother.\nThe first situation phobias of children are darkness and solitude; the\nformer often persists throughout life; common to both is the absence of\nthe dear nurse, the mother. I once heard a child, who was afraid of the\ndark, call into an adjoining room, \"Auntie, talk to me, I am afraid.\"\n\"But what good will that do you? You cannot see me!\" Whereupon the child\nanswered, \"If someone speaks, it is brighter.\" The yearning felt in\ndarkness is converted into the fear of darkness. Far from saying that\nneurotic fear is only a secondary, a special case of real fear, we\nobserve in little children something that resembles the behavior of real\nfear and has in common with neurotic fear, this characteristic feature:\norigin from unemployed libido. The child seems to bring very little real\nfear into the world. In all situations which may later become the\nconditions of phobias, on elevations, narrow bridges across water, on\nrailroad and boat trips, the child exhibits no fear. And the more\nignorant he is, the less fear he feels. It would be most desirable to\nhave a greater heritage of such life-preservative instincts; the task of\nsupervision, which is to hinder him from exposing himself to one danger\nafter another, would be lessened. In reality the child at first\noverestimates his powers and behaves fearlessly because he does not\nrecognize dangers. He will run to the water's edge, mount the window\nsill, play with fire or with sharp utensils, in short, he will do\neverything that would harm him and alarm his guardians. The awakening of\nreal fear is the result of education, since we may not permit him to\npass through the instructive experience himself.\nIf there are children who meet this education to fear half way, and who\ndiscover dangers of which they have not been warned, the explanation\nsuffices that their constitution contains a greater measure of\nlibidinous need or that they have been spoiled early through libidinous\ngratification. No wonder that those persons who are nervous in later\nlife are recruited from the ranks of these children. We know that the\ncreation of neurosis is made easy by the inability to endure a\nconsiderable amount of pent-up libido for any length of time. You see\nthat here too we must do justice to the constitutional factor, whose\nrights we never wish to question. We fight shy of it only when others\nneglect all other claims for this, and introduce the constitutional\nfactor where it does not belong according to the combined results of\nobservation and analysis, or where it must be the last consideration.\nLet us extract the sum of our observations on the anxiety of children:\nInfantile fear has very little to do with real fear, but is closely\nrelated to the neurotic fear of adults. It originates in unemployed\nlibido and replaces the object of love that is lacking by an external\nobject or situation.\nNow you will be glad to hear that the analysis of phobias cannot teach\nmuch more that is new. The same thing occurs in them as in the fear of\nchildren; unemployed libido is constantly being converted into real fear\nand so a tiny external danger takes the place of the demands of the\nlibido. This coincidence is not strange, for infantile phobias are not\nonly the prototypes but the direct prerequisite and prelude to later\nphobias, which are grouped with the anxiety hysterias. Every hysteria\nphobia can be traced to childish fear of which it is a continuation,\neven if it has another content and must therefore receive a different\nname. The difference between the two conditions lies in their mechanism.\nIn the adult the fact that the libido has momentarily become useless in\nthe form of longing, is not sufficient to effect the transformation of\nfear into libido. He has long since learned to maintain such libido in a\nsuspended state or to use it differently. But when the libido is part of\na psychic impulse which has experienced suppression, similar conditions\nto those of the child, who cannot distinguish the conscious from the\nunconscious, are reestablished. The regression to infantile phobia is\nthe bridge where the transformation of libido into fear is conveniently\neffected. We have, as you know, spoken a great deal about suppression,\nbut we have always followed the fate of the conception that was to be\nsuppressed, because this was easier to recognize and to present. We have\nalways omitted from our consideration what happened to the emotion that\nclung to the suppressed idea; and only now we learn that whatever\nquality this emotion might have manifested under normal conditions, its\nfate is a transformation into fear. This transformation of emotion is by\nfar the more important part of the suppression process. It is not so\neasy to discuss, because we cannot assert the existence of unconscious\nemotions in the same sense as unconscious ideas. With one difference, an\nidea remains the same whether it is conscious or unconscious; we can\ngive an account of what corresponds to an unconscious idea. But an\nemotion is a release and must be judged differently from an idea.\nWithout a deeper reflection and clarification of our hypotheses of\npsychic processes, we cannot tell what corresponds to its unconscious\nstage. We cannot undertake this here. But we want to retain the\nimpression we have gained, that the development of anxiety is closely\nconnected with the unconscious system.\nI said that the transformation into fear, rather a discharge in the form\nof fear, is the immediate fate of suppressed libido. Not the only or\nfinal fate, I must add. These neuroses are accompanied by processes that\nstrive to restrain the development of fear, and succeed in various ways.\nIn phobias, for instance, two phases of the neurotic process can be\nclearly distinguished. The first effects the suppression of libido and\nits transition to fear, which is joined to an external danger. The\nsecond consists in building up all those precautions and safety devices\nwhich are to prevent contact with this danger which is dealt with as an\nexternal fact. Suppression corresponds to the ego's flight from the\nlibido, which it regards dangerous. The phobia is comparable to a\nfortification against outer danger, which is represented by the much\nfeared libido. The weakness of the phobias' system of defense lies in\nthe fact that the fort has been strengthened from without and has\nremained vulnerable within. The projection of peril from the libido into\nthe environment is never very successful. In other neuroses, therefore,\nother systems of defense are used against the possibility of fear\ndevelopment. That is an interesting aspect of the psychology of\nneurosis. Unfortunately its study would lead us to digress too far, and\npresupposes a more thorough and special knowledge of the subject. I\nshall add only one thing more. I have already spoken to you of the\ncounter siege by which the ego imprisons the suppression and which it\nmust maintain permanently for the suppression to subsist. The task of\nthis counter siege is to carry out diverse forms of defense against the\nfear development which follows the suppression.\nTo return to the phobias, I may now say that you realize how\ninsufficient it would be to explain only their content, to be interested\nonly in knowing that this or that object or situation is made the\nsubject of a phobia. The content of the phobia has about the same\nimportance for it as the manifest dream facade has for the dream. With\nsome necessary restrictions, we admit that among the contents of the\nphobias are some that are especially qualified to be objects of fear\nthrough phylogenetic inheritance, as Stanley Hall has emphasized. In\nharmony with this is the fact that many of these objects of fear can\nestablish connections with danger only by symbolic relations.\nAnd so we are convinced of the central position that the problem of fear\nassumes in the questions of the neurotic psychology. We are deeply\nimpressed with how closely the development of fear is interwoven with\nthe fate of the libido and the unconscious system. There is only one\ndisconnected point, one inconsistency in our hypothesis: the\nindisputable fact that real fear must be considered an expression of the\nego's instincts of self-preservation.\nTWENTY-SIXTH LECTURE\nGENERAL THEORY OF THE NEUROSES\n_The Libido Theory and Narcism_\nRepeatedly in the past and more recently we have dealt with the\ndistinction between the ego instincts and the sexual instincts. At\nfirst, suppression taught us that the two may be flatly opposed to each\nother, that in the struggle the sexual instincts suffer apparent defeat\nand are forced to obtain satisfaction by other regressive methods, and\nso find the compensation for defeat in their invulnerability. After that\nwe learned that at the outset both have a different relation to the\neducator, Necessity, so that they do not develop in the same manner and\ndo not enter into the same relationship with the principle of reality.\nWe come to realize that the sexual instincts are much more closely\nallied to the emotional condition of fear than the ego instincts. This\nresult appears incomplete only in one respect, which, however, is most\nimportant. For further evidence we shall mention the significant fact\nthat non-satisfaction of hunger and thirst, the two most elementary\ninstincts of self-preservation, never result in their reversal into\nanxiety, while the transformation of unsatisfied libido into fear is, as\nwe have heard, one of the best known and most frequently observed\nphenomena.\nNo one can contest our perfect justification in separating the ego from\nsexual instincts. It is affirmed by the existence of sexual desire,\nwhich is a very special activity of the individual. The only question\nis, what significance shall we give to this distinction, how decisive is\nit? The answer will depend upon the results of our observations; on how\nfar the sexual instincts, in their psychological and somatic\nmanifestations, behave differently from the others that are opposed to\nthem; on how important are the consequences which result from these\ndifferences. We have, of course, no motive whatever for insisting upon\na certain intangible difference in the character of the two groups of\ninstincts. Both are only designations of the sources of energy of the\nindividual. The discussion as to whether they are fundamentally of the\nsame or of a different character, and if the same, when it was that they\nseparated from one another, cannot profit by the conceptions, but must\ndeal rather with the underlying biological facts. At present we know\nvery little about this, and even if we knew more it would not be\nrelevant to our analytic task.\nObviously, we should gain slight profit if, following the example of\nJung, we were to emphasize the original unity of all instincts, and were\nto call the energy expressed in all of them \"libido.\" Since the sexual\nfunction cannot be eliminated from psychic life by any device, we are\nforced to speak of sexual and asexual libido. As in the past, we rightly\nretain the name libido for the instincts of sexual life.\nI believe, therefore, that the question, how far the justifiable\ndistinction of the instincts of sex and of self-preservation may be\ncarried, is of little importance for psychoanalysis; and psychoanalysis\nis moreover not competent to deal with it. From a biological standpoint\nthere are, to be sure, various reasons for believing that this\ndistinction is significant. Sexuality is the only function of the living\norganism which extends beyond the individual and sees to his kinship\nwith the species. It is undeniable that its practice does not always\nbenefit the individual as do his other performances. For the price of\necstatic pleasures it involves him in dangers which threaten his life\nand frequently cause death. Probably peculiar metabolic processes,\ndifferent from all others, are required to maintain a part of the\nindividual life for its progeny. The individual who places himself in\nthe foreground and regards his sexuality as a means to his gratification\nis, from a biological point of view, only an episode in a series of\ngenerations, a transient appendage to a germ-plasm which is virtually\nendowed with immortality, just as though he were the temporary partner\nin a corporation which continues to persist after his death.\nFor psychoanalytic explanation of neuroses, however, there is no need to\nenter upon these far-reaching implications. By separate observation of\nthe sexual and the ego instincts, we have gained the key to the\nunderstanding of transference-neuroses. We were able to trace them back\nto the fundamental situation where the sexual instinct and the instinct\nof self-preservation had come in conflict with one another, or\nbiologically although not so accurately, expressed where the part played\nby the ego, that of independent individuality, was opposed to the other,\nthat of a link in a series of generations. Only human beings are capable\nof such conflict, and therefore, taken all in all, neurosis is the\nprerogative of man, and not of animals. The excessive development of his\nlibido and the elaboration of a varied and complicated psychic life thus\nmade possible, appear to have created the conditions prerequisite for\nconflict. It is clear that these conditions are also responsible for the\ngreat progress that man has made beyond his kinship with animals. The\ncapacity for neurosis is really only the reverse side of his talents and\ngifts. But these are only speculations, which divert us from our task.\nUntil now we worked with the impulse that we can distinguish the ego and\nthe sexual instincts from one another by their manifestations. We could\ndo this without difficulty in the transference neuroses. We called the\naccumulation of energy which the ego directed towards the object of its\nsexual striving libido and all others, which proceeded from the\ninstincts of self-preservation, interest. We were able to achieve our\nfirst insight into the workings of psychic forces by observing the\naccumulation of the libido, its transformations and its final destiny.\nThe transference neuroses furnished the best material for this. But the\nego, composed from various organizations, their construction and\nfunctioning, remained hidden and we were led to believe that only the\nanalysis of other neurotic disturbances would raise the veil.\nVery soon we began to extend these psychoanalytic conceptions to other\nconditions. As early as 1908, K. Abraham asserted, after a discussion\nwith me, that the principal characteristic of dementia praecox (which\nmay be considered one of the psychoses) is _that there is no libidinous\noccupation of objects_ (_The Psycho-sexual Differences between Hysteria\nand Dementia Praecox_). But then the question arose, what happens to the\nlibido of the demented, which is diverted from its objects? Abraham did\nnot hesitate to give the answer, \"It is turned back upon the ego, and\n_this reflected turning back is the source of the megalomania_ in\ndementia praecox.\" This hallucination of greatness is exactly comparable\nto the well-known over-estimation of the objects habitual to lovers. So,\nfor the first time, we gained an understanding of psychotic condition by\ncomparing it with the normal course of love.\nThese first interpretations of Abraham's have been maintained in\npsychoanalysis, and have become the basis of our attitude towards the\npsychoses. Slowly we familiarized ourselves with the idea that the\nlibido, which we find attached to certain objects, which expresses a\nstriving to attain gratification from these objects, may also forsake\nthem and put in their place the person's own ego. Gradually these ideas\nwere developed more and more consistently. The name for this placing of\nthe libido--narcism--was borrowed from one of the perversions described\nby P. Naecke. In it the grown individual lavishes upon his own body all\nthe affection usually devoted to some foreign sex object.\nWe reflected that if such a fixation of libido on one's own body and\nperson instead of on some external object exists, this cannot be an\nexceptional or trivial occurrence. It is much more probable that this\nnarcism is the general and original condition, out of which the love for\nan object later develops, without however necessarily causing narcism to\ndisappear. From the evolutionary history of object-libido we remembered\nthat in the beginning many sex instincts seek auto-erotic gratification,\nand that this capacity for auto-eroticism forms the basis for the\nretardation of sexuality in its education to conformity with fact. And\nso, auto-eroticism was the sexual activity of the narcistic stage in the\nplacing of the libido.\nTo be brief: We represented the relation of the ego-libido to the\nobject-libido in a way which I can explain by an analogy from zoology.\nThink of the simplest forms of life, which consist of a little lump of\nprotoplasmic substance which is only slightly differentiated. They\nstretch out protrusions, known as pseudopia, into which the protoplasm\nflows. But they can withdraw these protrusions and assume their original\nshape. Now we compare the stretching out of these processes with the\nradiation of libido to the objects, while the central mass of libido can\nremain in the ego, and we assume that under normal conditions ego-libido\ncan be changed into object-libido, and this can again be taken up into\nthe ego, without any trouble.\nWith the help of this representation we can now explain a great number\nof psychic conditions, or to express it more modestly, describe them, in\nthe language of the libido theory; conditions that we must accredit to\nnormal life, such as the psychic attitude during love, during organic\nsickness, during sleep. We assumed that the conditions of sleep rest\nupon withdrawal from the outer world and concentration upon the wish to\nsleep. The nocturnal psychic activity expressed in the dream we found in\nthe service of a wish to sleep and, moreover, governed by wholly\negoistic motives. Continuing in the sense of libido theory: sleep is a\ncondition in which all occupations of objects, the libidinous as well as\nthe egoistic, are given up, and are withdrawn into the ego. Does this\nnot throw a new light upon recovery during sleep, and upon the nature of\nexhaustion in general? The picture of blissful isolation in the\nintra-uterine life, which the sleeper conjures up night after night,\nthus also completes the picture from the psychic side. In the sleeper\nthe original condition of libido division is again restored, a condition\nof complete narcism in which libido and ego-interest are still united\nand live indistinguishably in the self-sufficient ego.\nWe must observe two things: First, how can the conceptions of narcism\nand egoism be distinguished? I believe narcism is the libidinous\ncomplement of egoism. When we speak of egoism we mean only the benefits\nto the individual; if we speak of narcism we also take into account his\nlibidinous satisfaction. As practical motives the two can be followed up\nseparately to a considerable degree. One can be absolutely egoistic, and\nstill have strong libidinous occupation of objects, in so far as the\nlibidinous gratification by way of the object serves the needs of the\nego. Egoism will then take care that the striving for the object results\nin no harm to the ego. One can be egoistic and at the same time\nexcessively narcistic, i.e., have very slight need of an object. This\nneed may be for direct sexual satisfaction or even for those higher\ndesires, derived from need, which we are in the habit of calling love as\nopposed to sensuality. In all of these aspects, egoism is the\nself-evident, the constant, and narcism the variable element. The\nantithesis of egoism, _altruism_, is not the same as the conception of\nlibidinous occupation of objects. Altruism differs from it by the\nabsence of desire for sexual satisfaction. But in the state of being\ncompletely in love, altruism and libidinous occupation with an object\nclash. The sex object as a rule draws upon itself a part of the narcism\nof the ego. This is generally called \"sexual over-estimation\" of the\nobject. If the altruistic transformation from egoism to the sex object\nis added, the sex object becomes all powerful; it has virtually sucked\nup the ego.\nI think you will find it a pleasant change if after the dry phantasy of\nscience I present to you a poetic representation of the economic\ncontrast between narcism and being in love. I take it from the\n_Westostliche Divans_ of Goethe:\nSULEIKA:\nConqueror and serf and nation;\nThey proclaim it joyously;\nMankind's loftiest elation,\nShines in personality.\nLife's enchantment lures and lingers,\nOf yourself is not afar,\nAll may slip through passive fingers,\nIf you tarry as you are.\nHATEM:\nNever could I be thus ravished,\nOther thoughts are in my mind,\nAll the gladness earth has lavished\nIn Suleika's charms I find.\nWhen I cherish her, then only\nDearer to myself I grow,\nIf she turned to leave me lonely\nI should lose the self I know.\nHatem's happiness were over,--\nBut his changeling soul would glide\nInto any favored lover\nWhom she fondles at her side.\nThe second observation is supplementary to the dream theory. We cannot\nexplain the origin of the dream unless we assume that the suppressed\nunconscious has achieved a certain independence of the ego. It does not\nconform to the wish for sleep and retains its hold on the energies that\nhave seized it, even when all the occupations with objects dependent\nupon the ego have been released for the benefit of sleep. Not until then\ncan we understand how this unconscious can take advantage of the\nnocturnal discontinuance or deposition of the censor, and can seize\ncontrol of fragments left over from the day to fashion a forbidden dream\nwish from them. On the other hand, it is to the already existing\nconnections with these supposed elements that these fragments owe a part\nof the resistance directed against the withdrawal of the libido, and\ncontrolled by the wish for sleep. We also wish to supplement our\nconception of dream formation with this trait of dynamic importance.\nOrganic diseases, painful irritations, inflammation of the organs create\na condition which clearly results in freeing the libido of its objects.\nThe withdrawn libido again finds itself in the ego and occupies the\ndiseased part of the part. We may even venture to assert that under\nthese conditions the withdrawal of the libido from its objects is more\nconspicuous than the withdrawal of egoistic interest from the outside\nworld. This seems to open the way to an understanding of hypochondria,\nwhere an organ occupies the ego in a similar way without being diseased,\naccording to our conception. I shall resist the temptation of continuing\nalong this line, or of discussing other situations which we can\nunderstand or represent through the assumption that the object libido\ntravels to the ego. For I am eager to meet two objections, which I know\nare absorbing your attention. In the first place, you want to call me to\naccount for my insistence upon distinguishing in sleep, in sickness and\nin similar situations between libido and interest, sexual instincts and\nego instincts, since throughout the observations can be explained by\nassuming a single and uniform energy, which, freely mobile, occupies now\nthe object, now the ego, and enters into the services of one or the\nother of these impulses. And, secondly, how can I venture to treat the\nfreeing of libido from its object as the source of a pathological\ncondition, since such transformation of object-libido into\nego-libido--or more generally, ego-energy--belongs to the normal, daily\nand nightly repeated occurrences of psychic dynamics?\nThe answer is: Your first objection sounds good. The discussion of the\nconditions of sleep, of sickness and of being in love would in\nthemselves probably never have led to a distinction between ego-libido\nand object-libido, or between libido and interest. But you do not take\ninto account the investigations from which we have set out, in the\nlight of which we now regard the psychic situations under discussion.\nThe necessity of distinguishing between libido and interest, that is,\nbetween sexual instincts and those of self-preservation, is forced upon\nus by our insight into the conflict out of which the transference\nneuroses emerge. We can no longer reckon without it. The assumption that\nobject-libido can change into the ego-libido, in other words, that we\nmust reckon with an ego-libido, appeared to us the only possible one\nwherewith to solve the riddle of the so-called narcistic neuroses--for\ninstance, dementia praecox--or to justify the similarities and\ndifferences in a comparison of hysteria and compulsion. We now apply to\nsickness, sleep and love that which we found undeniably affirmed\nelsewhere. We may proceed with such applications as far as they will go.\nThe only assertion that is not a direct refutation of our analytic\nexperience is that libido remains libido whether it is directed towards\nobjects or toward the ego itself, and is never transferred into egoistic\ninterest, and vice-versa. But this assertion is of equal weight with the\ndistinction of sex and ego instincts which we have already critically\nappraised, and which we will maintain from methodological motives until\nit may possibly be disproved.\nYour second objection, too, raises a justified question, but it points\nin a wrong direction. To be sure the retreat of object-libido into the\nego is not purely pathogenic; we see that it occurs each time before\ngoing to sleep, only to be released again upon awaking. The little\nprotoplasmic animal draws in its protrusions, only to send them out\nagain on a later occasion. But it is quite another matter when a\nspecific, very energetic process compels the withdrawal of libido from\nthe object. The libido has become narcistic and cannot find its way back\nto the object, and this hindrance to the mobility of the libido\ncertainly becomes pathogenic. It appears that an accumulation of\nnarcistic libido cannot be borne beyond a certain point. We can imagine\nthat the reason for occupation with the object is that the ego found it\nnecessary to send out its libido in order not to become diseased because\nit was pent up. If it were our plan to go further into the subject of\ndementia praecox, I would show you that this process which frees the\nlibido from the objects and bars the way back to them, is closely\nrelated to the process of suppression, and must be considered as its\ncounterpart. But above all you would recognize familiar ground, for the\nconditions of these processes are practically identical, as far as we\ncan now see, with those of suppression. The conflict appears to be the\nsame, and to take place between the same forces. The reason for a result\nas different as, for instance, the result in hysteria, can be found only\nin a difference of dispositions. The vulnerable point in the libido\ndevelopment of these patients lies in another phase; the controlling\nfixation, which, as you will remember, permits the breach resulting in\nthe formation of symptoms, is in another place probably in the stage of\nprimitive narcism, to which dementia praecox returns in its final stage.\nIt is noteworthy that for all the narcistic neuroses, we must assume\nfixation points of the libido which reach back into far earlier phases\nof development than in cases of hysteria or compulsion neuroses. But you\nhave heard that the conceptions obtained in our study of transference\nneuroses are sufficient to orient us in the narcistic neuroses, which\npresent far greater practical difficulties. The similarities are\nconsiderable; it is fundamentally the same field of observation. But you\ncan easily imagine how hopeless the explanations of these conditions,\nwhich belong to psychiatry, appear to him who is not equipped for this\ntask with an analytic knowledge of transference neuroses.\nThe picture given by the symptoms of dementia praecox, which, moreover,\nis highly variable, is not exclusively determined by the symptoms. These\nresult from forcing the libido away from the objects and accumulating it\nin the ego in the form of narcistic libido. A large space is occupied by\nother phenomena, which result from the impulses of the libido to regain\nthe objects, and so show an attempt toward restitution and healing.\nThese symptoms are in fact the more conspicuous, the more clamorous;\nthey show an unquestionable similarity to those of hysteria, or less\noften to those of compulsion neurosis, and yet they are different in\nevery respect. It appears that in dementia praecox the libido in its\nendeavor to return to the objects, i.e., to the images of the objects,\nreally captures something, but only their shadows--I mean, the verbal\nimages belonging to them. This is not the place to discuss this matter,\nbut I believe that these reversed impulses of the libido have permitted\nus an insight into what really determines the difference between a\nconscious and an unconscious representation.\nI have now brought you into the field where we may expect the further\nprogress of analytic work. Since we can now employ the conception of\nego-libido, the narcistic neuroses have become accessible to us. We are\nconfronted with the problem of finding a dynamic explanation of these\nconditions and at the same time of enlarging our knowledge of psychic\nlife by an understanding of the ego. The ego psychology, which we strive\nto understand, must not be founded upon introspective data, but rather,\nas in the libido, upon analysis of the disturbances and decompositions\nof the ego. When this greater task is accomplished we shall probably\ndisparage our previous knowledge of the fate of the libido which we\ngained from our study of the transference neuroses. But there is still\nmuch to be said in this matter. Narcistic neuroses can scarcely be\napproached by the same technique which served us in the transference\nneuroses. Soon you will hear why. After forging ahead a little in the\nstudy of narcistic neuroses we always seem to come to a wall which\nimpedes progress. You know that in the transference neuroses we also\nencountered such barriers of resistance, but we were able to break them\ndown piece by piece. In narcistic neuroses the resistance is\ninsuperable; at best we are permitted to cast a curious glance over the\nwall to spy out what is taking place on the other side. Our technical\nmethods must be replaced by others; we do not yet know whether or not we\nshall be able to find such a substitute. To be sure, even these patients\nfurnish us with ample material. They do say many things, though not in\nanswer to our questions, and for the time being we are forced to\ninterpret these utterances through the understanding we have gained from\nthe symptoms of transference neuroses. The coincidence is sufficiently\ngreat to assure us a good beginning. How far this technique will go,\nremains to be seen.\nThere are additional difficulties that impede our progress. The\nnarcistic conditions and the psychoses related to them can only be\nsolved by observers who have schooled themselves in analytic study of\ntransference neuroses. But our psychiatrists do not study psychoanalysis\nand we psychoanalysts see too few psychiatric cases. A race of\npsychiatrists that has gone through the school of psychoanalysis as a\npreparatory science most first grow up. The beginnings of this are now\nbeing made in America, where many leading psychiatrists explain the\nteachings of psychoanalysis to their students, and where many owners of\nsanatoriums and directors of institutes for the insane take pains to\nobserve their patients in the light of these teachings. But even here we\nhave occasionally been successful in casting a glance over the narcistic\nwall and I shall tell you a few things that we think we have discovered.\nThe disease of paranoia, chronic systematic insanity, is given a very\nuncertain position by the attempts at classification of present-day\npsychiatry. There is no doubt of its close relationship to dementia\npraecox. I once was so bold as to propose that paranoia and dementia\npraecox could be classed together under the common name of paraphrenia.\nThe types of paranoia are described according to their content as:\nmegalomania, the mania of persecution, eroto mania, mania of jealousy,\netc. From psychiatry we do not expect attempts at explanation. As an\nexample of such an attempt, to be sure an antiquated and not entirely\nvalid example, I might mention the attempt to develop one symptom\ndirectly out of another by means of an intellectual rationalization, as:\nthe patient who primarily believes he is being persecuted draws the\nconclusion from this persecution that he must be an extraordinarily\nimportant personality and thus develops megalomania. In our analytical\nconception megalomania is the immediate outcome of exaggeration of the\nego, which results from the drawing-in of libidinous occupation with\nobjects, a secondary narcism as a recurrence of the originally early\ninfantile form. In cases of the mania of persecution we have noticed a\nfew things that lead us to follow a definite track. In the first place,\nwe observed that in the great majority of cases the persecutor was of\nthe same sex as the persecuted. This could still be explained in a\nharmless way, but in a few carefully studied cases it was clearly shown\nthat the person of the same sex, who was most loved in normal times,\nbecame the persecutor after the malady set in. A further development is\nmade possible by the fact that one loved person is replaced by another,\naccording to familiar affinities, e.g., the father by the teacher or the\nsuperior. We concluded from such ever-increasing experiences, that\nparanoia persecutoria is the form in which the individual guards himself\nagainst a homosexual tendency that has become too powerful. The change\nfrom affection to hate, which notoriously may take the form of serious\nthreats against the life of the loved and hated person, expresses the\ntransformation of libidinous impulse into fear, which is a regularly\nrecurring result of the process of suppression. As an illustration I\nshall cite the last case in which I made observations on this subject. A\nyoung physician had to be sent away from his home town because he had\nthreatened the life of the son of a university professor, who up to that\ntime had been his best friend. He ascribed truly devilish intentions to\nhis erstwhile friend and credited him with power of a demon. He was to\nblame for all the misfortunes that had in recent years befallen the\nfamily of the patient, for all his personal and social ill-luck. But\nthis was not enough. The wicked friend, and his father the professor,\nhad been the cause of the war and had called the Russians into the land.\nHe had forfeited his life a thousand times and our patient was convinced\nthat with the death of the culprit all misfortune would come to an end.\nAnd yet his old affection for his friend was so great that it had\nparalyzed his hand when he had had the opportunity of shooting down the\nenemy at close quarters. In my short consultations with the patient, I\ndiscovered that the friendship between the two dated back to early\nschool-life. Once at least the bonds of friendship had been\nover-stepped; a night spent together had been the occasion for complete\nsexual intercourse. Our patient never felt attracted to women, as would\nhave been natural to his age or his charming personality. At one time he\nwas engaged to a beautiful and distinguished young girl, but she broke\noff the engagement because she found so little affection in her fiance.\nYears later his malady broke out just at that moment when for the first\ntime he had succeeded in giving complete gratification to a woman. When\nthis woman embraced him, full of gratitude and devotion, he suddenly\nfelt a strange pain which cut around his skull like a sharp incision.\nHis later interpretation of this sensation was that an incision such as\nis used to expose a part of the brain had been performed upon him, and\nsince his friend had become a pathological anatomist, he gradually came\nto the conclusion that he alone could have sent him this last woman as a\ntemptation. From that time on his eyes were also opened to the other\npersecutions in which he was to be the victim of the intrigues of his\nformer friend.\nBut how about those cases where the persecutor is not of the same sex as\nthe persecuted, where our explanation of a guard against homosexual\nlibido is apparently contradicted? A short time ago I had occasion to\ninvestigate such a case and was able to glean corroboration from this\napparent contradiction. A young girl thought she was followed by a man,\nwith whom she had twice had intimate relations. She had, as a matter of\nfact, first laid these maniacal imputations at the door of a woman, whom\nwe may consider as having played the part of a mother-substitute in her\npsychic life. Only after the second meeting did she progress to the\npoint of diverting this maniacal idea from the woman and of transferring\nit to the man. The condition that the persecutor must be of the same sex\nwas also originally maintained in this instance. In her claim before the\nlawyer and the physician, this patient did not mention this first stage\nof her mania, and this caused the appearance of a contradiction to our\ntheory of paranoia.\nHomosexual choice of object is originally more natural to narcism than\nthe heterosexual. If it is a matter of thwarting a strong and\nundesirable homosexual impulse, the way back to narcism is made\nespecially easy. Until now I have had very little opportunity of\nspeaking to you about the fundamental conditions of love-life, so far as\nwe know them, and now I cannot make up for lost time. I only want to\npoint out that the choice of an object, that progress in the development\nof the libido which comes after the narcistic stage, can proceed\naccording to two different types--either according to the _narcistic_\ntype, which puts a very similar personality in the place of the personal\nego, or according to the _dependent_ type, which chooses those persons\nwho have become valuable by satisfying needs of life other than as\nobjects of the libido. We also accredit a strong fixation of the libido\nto the narcistic type of object-choice when there is a disposition\ntoward manifest homosexuality.\nYou will recall that in our first meeting of this semester I told you\nabout the case of a woman who suffered from the mania of jealousy. Since\nwe are so near the end you certainly will be glad to hear the\npsychoanalytic explanation of a maniacal idea. But I have less to say\nabout it than you expect. The maniacal idea as well as the compulsion\nidea cannot be assailed by logical arguments or actual experience. This\nis explained by their relation to the unconscious, which is represented\nby the maniacal idea or the compulsion idea, and held down by whichever\nis effective. The difference between the two is based upon respective\nlocalization and dynamic relations of the two conditions.\nAs in paranoia, so also in melancholia, of which, moreover, very\ndifferent clinical forms are described. We have discovered a point of\nvantage which will yield us an insight into the inner structure of the\ncondition. We realize that the self-accusations with which these\nmelancholic patients torture themselves in the most pitiless way, really\napply to another person, namely, the sex object which they have lost, or\nwhich through some fault has lost value for them. From this we may\nconclude that the melancholic has withdrawn his libido from the object.\nThrough a process which we designate as \"narcistic identification\" the\nobject is built up within the ego itself, is, so to say, projected upon\nthe ego. Here I can give you only a descriptive representation, as yet\nwithout reference to the topical and dynamic relations. The personal ego\nis now treated in the same manner as the abandoned object, and suffers\nall the aggression and expressions of revenge which were planned for the\nobject. Even the suicidal tendencies of melancholia are more\ncomprehensible when we consider that this bitterness of the patient\nfalls alike on the ego itself and on the object of its love and hate. In\nmelancholia as well as in other narcistic conditions a feature of\nemotional life is strikingly shown which, since the time of Bleuler, we\nhave been accustomed to designate as _ambivalence_. By this we mean that\nhostile and affectionate feelings are directed against one and the same\nperson. I have, in the course of these discussions, unfortunately not\nbeen in a position to tell you more about this emotional ambivalence.\nWe have, in addition to narcistic identification, an hysterical\nidentification as well, which moreover has been known to us for a much\nlonger time. I wish it were possible to determine clearly the difference\nbetween the two. Of the periodic and cyclic forms of melancholia I can\ntell you something that you will certainly be glad to hear, for it is\npossible, under favorable circumstances--I have twice had the\nexperience--to prevent these emotional conditions (or their antitheses)\nby means of analytic treatment in the free intervals between the\nattacks. We learn that in melancholia as well as in mania, it is a\nmatter of finding a special way for solving the conflict, the\nprerequisites for which entirely coincide with those of other neuroses.\nYou can imagine how much there still is for psychoanalysis to learn in\nthis field.\nI told you, too, that we hoped to gain a knowledge of the structure of\nthe ego, and of the separate factors out of which it is built by means\nof the analysis of narcistic conditions. In one place we have already\nmade a beginning. From the analysis of the maniacal delusion of being\nwatched we concluded that in the ego there is really an agent which\ncontinually watches, criticizes and compares the other part of the ego\nand thus opposes it. We believe that the patient imparts to us a truth\nthat is not yet sufficiently appreciated, when he complains that all his\nactions are spied upon and watched, all his thoughts recorded and\ncriticized. He errs only in transferring this distressing force to\nsomething alien, outside of himself. He feels the dominance of a factor\nin his ego, which compares his actual ego and all of its activities to\nan _ideal ego_ that he has created in the course of his development. We\nalso believe that the creation of this ideal ego took place with the\npurpose of again establishing that self-satisfaction which is bound up\nwith the original infantile narcism, but which since then has\nexperienced so many disturbances and disparagements. In this\nself-observing agent we recognize the ego-censor, the conscience; it is\nthe same factor which at night exercises dream-censorship, and which\ncreates the suppressions against inadmissible wish-impulses. Under\nanalysis in the maniacal delusion of being watched it reveals its origin\nin the influence of parents, tutors and social environment and in the\nidentification of the ego with certain of these model individuals.\nThese are some of the conclusions which the application of\npsychoanalysis to narcistic conditions has yielded us. They are\ncertainly all too few, and they often lack that accuracy which can only\nbe acquired in a new field with the attainment of absolute familiarity.\nWe owe them all to the exploitation of the conception of ego-libido or\nnarcistic libido, by the aid of which we have extended to narcistic\nneuroses those observations which were confirmed in the transference\nneuroses. But now you will ask, is it possible for us to succeed in\nsubordinating all the disturbances of narcistic conditions and the\npsychoses to the libido theory in such a way that in every case we\nrecognize the libidinous factor of psychic life as the cause of the\nmalady, and never make an abnormality in the functioning of the\ninstincts of self-preservation answerable? Ladies and gentlemen, this\nconclusion does not seem urgent to me, and above all not ripe for\ndecision. We can best leave it calmly to the progress of the science. I\nshould not be surprised to find that the power to exert a pathogenic\ninfluence is really an exclusive prerogative of the libidinous impulses,\nand that the libido theory will celebrate its triumphs along the whole\nline from the simplest true neurosis to the most difficult psychotic\nderangement of the individual. For we know it to be a characteristic of\nthe libido that it is continually struggling against subordinating\nitself to the realities of the world. But I consider it most probable\nthat the ego instincts are indirectly swept along by the pathogenic\nexcitations of the libido and forced into a functional disturbance.\nMoreover, I cannot see any defeat for our trend of investigation when we\nare confronted with the admission that in difficult psychoses the ego\nimpulses themselves are fundamentally led astray; the future will teach\nus--or at least it will teach you. Let me return for one moment more to\nfear, in order to eliminate one last ambiguity that we have left. We\nhave said that the relation between fear and the libido, which in other\nrespects seems clearly defined, does not fit in with the assumption that\nin the face of danger real fear should become the expression of the\ninstinct of self-preservation. This, however, can hardly be doubted. But\nsuppose the emotion of fear is not contested by the egoistic ego\nimpulse, but rather by the ego-libido? The condition of fear is in all\ncases purposeless and its lack of purpose is obvious when it reaches a\nhigher level. It then disturbs the action, be it flight or defense,\nwhich alone is purposeful, and which serves the ends of\nself-preservation. If we accredit the emotional component of actual fear\nto the ego-libido, and the accompanying activity to the egoistic\ninstinct to self-preservation, we have overcome every theoretical\ndifficulty. Furthermore, you do not really believe that we flee\n_because_ we experience fear? On the contrary, we first are afraid _and\nthen_ take to flight from the same motive that is awakened by the\nrealization of danger. Men who have survived the endangering of their\nlives tell us that they were not at all afraid, they only acted. They\nturned the weapon against the wild animal, and that was in fact the most\npurposeful thing to do.\nTWENTY-SEVENTH LECTURE\nGENERAL THEORY OF THE NEUROSES\n_Transference_\nWe are nearing the close of our discussions, and you probably cherish\ncertain expectations, which shall not be disappointed. You think, I\nsuppose, that I have not guided you through thick and thin of\npsychoanalytic subject matter to dismiss you without a word about\ntherapy, which furnishes the only possibility of carrying on\npsychoanalysis. I cannot possibly omit this subject, for the observation\nof some of its aspects will teach you a new fact, without which the\nunderstanding of the diseases we have examined would be most incomplete.\nI know that you do not expect any guidance in the technique of\npractising analysis for therapeutic purposes. You wish to know only\nalong what general lines psychoanalytic therapy works and approximately\nwhat it accomplishes. And you have an undeniable right to know this. I\nshall not actually tell you, however, but shall insist that you guess it\nyourselves.\nOnly think! You know everything essential, from the conditions which\nprecipitate the illness to all the factors at work within. Where is\nthere room for therapeutic influence? In the first place, there is\nhereditary disposition; we do not speak of it often because it is\nstrongly emphasized from another quarter, and we have nothing new to say\nabout it. But do not think that we underestimate it. Just because we are\ntherapeutists, we feel its power distinctly. At any rate, we cannot\nchange it; it is a given fact which erects a barrier to our efforts. In\nthe second place, there is the influence of the early experiences of\nchildhood, which are in the habit of becoming sharply emphasized under\nanalysis; they belong to the past and we cannot undo them. And then\neverything that we include in the term \"actual forbearance\"--misfortunes\nof life out of which privations of love arise, poverty, family discord,\nunfortunate choice in marriage, unfavorable social conditions and the\nseverity of moral claims. These would certainly offer a foothold for\nvery effectual therapy. But it would have to be the kind of therapy\nwhich, according to the Viennese folk-tale, Emperor Joseph practiced:\nthe beneficial interference of a potentate, before whose will men bow\nand difficulties vanish. But who are we, to include such charity in the\nmethods of our therapy? Poor as we are, powerless in society, forced to\nearn our living by practicing medicine, we are not even in a position to\ntreat free of charge those patients who are unable to pay, as physicians\nwho employ other methods of treatment can do. Our therapy is too long\ndrawn-out, too extended for that. But perhaps you are still holding to\none of the factors already mentioned, and think that you have found a\nfactor through which our influence may be effective. If the restrictions\nof morality which are imposed by society have a share in the privation\nforced upon the patient, treatment might give him the courage, or\npossibly even the prescription itself, to cross these barriers, might\ntell him how gratification and health can be secured in the renunciation\nof that ideal which society has held up to us but often disregards. One\ngrows healthy then, by giving one's sexuality full reign. Such analytic\ntreatment, however, would be darkened by a shadow; it does not serve our\nrecognized morality. The gain to the individual is a loss to society.\nBut, ladies and gentlemen, who has misinformed you to this degree? It is\ninconceivable that the advice to give one's sexuality full reign can\nplay a part in analytic therapy, if only from the circumstance we have\nourselves described, that there is going on within the patient a bitter\nconflict between libidinous impulse and sexual suppression, between\nsensual and ascetic tendencies. This conflict is not abolished by giving\none of these tendencies the victory over its opponent. We see that in\nthe case of the nervous, asceticism has retained the upper hand. The\nconsequence of this is that the suppressed sexual desire gains breathing\nspace by the development of symptoms. If, on the other hand, we were to\ngive the victory to sexuality, symptoms would have to replace the sexual\nsuppression, which has been pushed aside. Neither of the two decisions\ncan end the inner conflict, one part always remains unsatisfied. There\nare only a few cases wherein the conflict is so labile, that a factor\nsuch as the intervention of the physician could be decisive, and these\ncases really require no analytic treatment. Persons who can be so much\ninfluenced by a physician would have found some solution without him.\nYou know that when an abstinent young man decides upon illegitimate\nsex-intercourse, or when an unsatisfied woman seeks compensation from\nanother man, they have generally not waited for the permission of a\nphysician, far less of an analyst, to do this.\nIn studying the situation, one essential point is generally overlooked,\nthat the pathogenic conflict of the neurotic must not be confused with\nnormal struggles between psychic impulses of which all have their root\nin the same psychological soil. The neurotic struggle is a strife of\nforces, one of which has attained the level of the fore-conscious and\nthe conscious, while the other has been held back in the unconscious\nstage. That is why the conflict can have no outcome; the struggling\nparties approach each other as little as in the well-known instance of\nthe polar-bear and the whale. A real decision can be reached only if\nboth meet on the same ground. To accomplish this is, I believe, the sole\ntask of therapy.\nMoreover, I assure you that you are misinformed if you assume that\nadvice and guidance in the affairs of life is an integral part of the\nanalytic influence. On the contrary, we reject this role of the mentor\nas far as possible. Above all, we wish to attain independent decisions\non the part of the patient. With this intention in mind, we require him\nto postpone all vital resolutions such as choice of a career, marriage\nor divorce, until the close of the treatment. You must confess that this\nis not what you had imagined. It is only in the case of certain very\nyoung or entirely helpless persons that we cannot insist upon the\ndesired limitation. Here we must combine the function of physician and\neducator; we are well aware of the responsibility and behave with the\nnecessary precaution.\nJudging from the zeal with which I defend myself against the accusation\nthat analytic treatment urges the nervous person to give his sexuality\nfull reign, you must not gather that we influence him for the benefit of\nconventional morality. We are just as far removed from that. We are no\nreformers, it is true, only observers, but we cannot help observing with\ncritical eyes, and we have found it impossible to take the part of\nconventional sex morality, or to estimate highly the way in which\nsociety has tried to regulate the problems of sexual life in practice.\nWe can prove to society mathematically that its code of ethics has\nexacted more sacrifices than is its worth, and that its procedure rests\nneither on veracity nor wisdom. We cannot spare our patients the task of\nlistening to this criticism. We accustom them to weigh sexual matters,\nas well as others, without prejudice; and when, after the completion of\nthe cure, they have become independent and choose some intermediate\ncourse between unrestrained sexuality and asceticism, our conscience is\nnot burdened by the consequences. We tell ourselves: whoever has been\nsuccessfully educated in being true to himself is permanently protected\nagainst the danger of immorality, even if his moral standard diverges\nfrom that of society. Let us, moreover, be careful not to overestimate\nthe significance of the problem of abstinence with respect to its\ninfluence on neuroses. Only the minority of pathogenic situations of\nforbearance, with a subsequent condition of pent-up libido, can be\nresolved without more ado by such sexual intercourse as can be procured\nwith little trouble.\nAnd so you cannot explain the therapeutic influence of psychoanalysis by\nsaying that it simply recommends giving full sway to sexuality. You must\nseek another solution. I think that while I was refuting this\nsupposition of yours, one of my remarks put you on the right track. Our\nusefulness consists in replacing the unconscious by the conscious, in\ntranslating the unconscious into the conscious. You are right; that is\nexactly it. By projecting the unconscious into the conscious, we do away\nwith suppressions, we remove conditions of symptom formation and\ntransform a pathogenic into a normal conflict which can be decided in\nsome way or other. This is the only psychic change we produce in our\npatients; its extent is the extent of our helpfulness. Wherever no\nsuppression and no analogous psychic process can be undone, there is no\nplace for our therapy.\nWe can express the aim of our efforts by various formulae of rendering\nthe unconscious conscious, removing suppressions, filling out amnestic\ngaps--it all amounts to the same thing. But perhaps this admission does\nnot satisfy you. You imagined that when a nervous person became cured\nsomething very different happened, that after having been subjected to\nthe laborious process of psychoanalysis, he was transformed into a\ndifferent human being. And now I tell you that the entire result is only\nthat he has a little less of the unconscious, a little more of the\nconscious within him. Well, you probably underestimate the significance\nof such an inner change. The person cured of neurosis has really become\nanother human being. Fundamentally, of course, he has remained the same.\nThat is to say, he has only become what he might have been under the\nmost favorable conditions. But that is saying a great deal. When you\nlearn all that has to be done, the effort required to effect apparently\nso slight a change in psychic life, the significance of such a\ndifference in the psychic realm will be credible to you.\nI shall digress for a moment to ask whether you know what is meant by a\ncausal therapy? This name is given to the procedure which does not take\nthe manifestations of disease for its point of departure, but seeks to\nremove the causes of disease. Is our psychoanalytical therapy causal or\nnot? The answer is not simple, but perhaps it will give us the\nopportunity of convincing ourselves that this point of departure is\ncomparatively fruitless. In so far as analytical therapy does not\nconcern itself immediately with the removal of symptoms, it may be\ntermed causal. Yet in another respect, you might say this would hardly\nfollow. For we have followed the causal chain back far beyond the\nsuppressions to the instinctive tendencies and their relative intensity\nas given by the constitution of the patient, and finally the nature of\nthe digression in the abnormal process of its development. Assume for a\nmoment that it were possible to influence these functions chemically, to\nincrease or to decrease the quantity of the libido that happens to be\npresent, to strengthen one impulse at the expense of another. This would\nbe causal therapy in its true sense and our analysis would have\nfurnished the indispensable preparatory work of reconnaissance. You know\nthat there is as yet no possibility of so influencing the processes of\nthe libido. Our psychic therapy interposes elsewhere, not exactly at\nthose sources of the phenomena which have been disclosed to us, but\nsufficiently far beyond the symptoms, at an opening in the structure of\nthe disease which has become accessible to us by means of peculiar\nconditions.\nWhat must we do in order to replace the unconscious by the conscious in\nour patient? At one time we thought this was quite simple, that all we\nhad to do was to reconstruct the unconscious and then tell the patient\nabout it. But we already know this was a shortsighted error. Our\nknowledge of the unconscious has not the same value as his; if we\ncommunicate our knowledge to him it will not stand _in place of_ the\nunconscious within him, but will exist _beside_ it, and only a very\nsmall change will have been effected. We must rather think of the\nunconscious as _localized_, and must seek it in memory at the point\nwhere it came into existence by means of a suppression. This suppression\nmust be removed before the substitution of the conscious for the\nunconscious can be successfully effected. How can such a suppression be\nremoved? Here our task enters a second phase. First to find the\nsuppression, then to remove the resistance by which this suppression is\nmaintained.\nHow can we do away with resistance? In the same way--by reconstructing\nit and confronting the patient with it. For resistance arises from\nsuppression, from the very suppression which we are trying to break up,\nor from an earlier one. It has been established by the counter-attack\nthat was instigated to suppress the offensive impulse. And so now we do\nthe very thing we intended at the outset: interpret, reconstruct,\ncommunicate--but now we do it in the right place. The counter-seizure of\nthe idea or resistance is not part of the unconscious but of the ego,\nwhich is our fellow-worker. This holds true even if resistance is not\nconscious. We know that the difficulty arises from the ambiguity of the\nword \"unconscious,\" which may connote either a phenomenon or a system.\nThat seems very difficult, but it is only a repetition, isn't it? We\nwere prepared for it a long time ago. We expect resistance to be\nrelinquished, the counter-siege to collapse, when our interpretation has\nenabled the ego to recognize it. With what impulses are we able to work\nin such a case? In the first place, the patient's desire to become well,\nwhich has led him to accommodate himself to co-operate with us in the\ntask of the cure; in the second place, the help of his intelligence,\nwhich is supported by the interpretation we offer him. There is no doubt\nthat after we have made clear to him what he may expect, the patient's\nintelligence can identify resistances, and find their translation into\nthe suppressions more readily. If I say to you, \"Look up into the sky,\nyou can see a balloon there,\" you will find it more readily than if I\nhad just asked you to look up to see whether you could discover\nanything. And unless the student who for the first time works with a\nmicroscope is told by his teacher what he may look for, he will not see\nanything, even if it is present and quite visible.\nAnd now for the fact! In a large number of forms of nervous illness, in\nhysteria, conditions of anxiety and compulsion neuroses, one hypothesis\nis correct. By finding the suppression, revealing resistance,\ninterpreting the thing suppressed, we really succeed in solving the\nproblem, in overcoming resistance, in removing suppression, in\ntransforming the unconscious into the conscious. While doing this we\ngain the clearest impression of the violent struggle that takes place in\nthe patient's soul for the subjugation of resistance--a normal\npsychological struggle, in one psychic sphere between the motives that\nwish to maintain the counter-siege and those which are willing to give\nit up. The former are the old motives that at one time effected\nsuppression; among the latter are those that have recently entered the\nconflict, to decide it, we trust, in the sense we favor. We have\nsucceeded in reviving the old conflict of the suppression, in reopening\nthe case that had already been decided. The new material we contribute\nconsists in the first place of the warning, that the former solution of\nthe conflict had led to illness, and the promise that another will pave\nthe way to health; secondly, the powerful change of all conditions since\nthe time of that first rejection. At that time the ego had been weak,\ninfantile and may have had reason to denounce the claims of the libido\nas if they were dangerous. Today it is strong, experienced and is\nsupported by the assistance of the physician. And so we may expect to\nguide the revived conflict to a better issue than a suppression, and in\nhysteria, fear and compulsion neuroses, as I have said before, success\njustifies our claims.\nThere are other forms of illness, however, in which our therapeutic\nprocedure never is successful, even though the causal conditions are\nsimilar. Though this may be characterized topically in a different way,\nin them there was also an original conflict between the ego and libido,\nwhich led to suppression. Here, too, it is possible to discover the\noccasions when suppressions occurred in the life of the patient. We\nemploy the same procedure, are prepared to furnish the same promises,\ngive the same kind of help. We again present to the patient the\nconnections we expect him to discover, and we have in our favor the same\ninterval in time between the treatment and these suppressions favoring a\nsolution of the conflict; yet in spite of these conditions, we are not\nable to overcome the resistance, or to remove the suppression. These\npatients, suffering from paranoia, melancholia, and dementia praecox,\nremain untouched on the whole, and proof against psychoanalytic therapy.\nWhat is the reason for this? It is not lack of intelligence; we require,\nof course, a certain amount of intellectual ability in our patients; but\nthose suffering from paranoia, for instance, who effect such subtle\ncombinations of facts, certainly are not in want of it. Nor can we say\nthat other motive forces are lacking. Patients suffering from\nmelancholia, in contrast to those afflicted with paranoia, are\nprofoundly conscious of being ill, of suffering greatly, but they are\nnot more accessible. Here we are confronted with a fact we do not\nunderstand, which bids us doubt if we have really understood all the\nconditions of success in other neuroses.\nIn the further consideration of our dealings with hysterical and\ncompulsion neurotics we soon meet with a second fact, for which we were\nnot at all prepared. After a while we notice that these patients behave\ntoward us in a very peculiar way. We thought that we had accounted for\nall the motive forces that could come into play, that we had\nrationalized the relation between the patient and ourselves until it\ncould be as readily surveyed as an example in arithmetic, and yet some\nforce begins to make itself felt that we had not considered in our\ncalculations. This unexpected something is highly variable. I shall\nfirst describe those of its manifestations which occur frequently and\nare easy to understand.\nWe see our patient, who should be occupying himself only with finding a\nway out of his painful conflicts, become especially interested in the\nperson of the physician. Everything connected with this person is more\nimportant to him than his own affairs and diverts him from his illness.\nDealings with him are very pleasant for the time being. He is especially\ncordial, seeks to show his gratitude wherever he can, and manifests\nrefinements and merits of character that we hardly had expected to\nfind. The physician forms a very favorable opinion of the patient and\npraises the happy chance that permitted him to render assistance to so\nadmirable a personality. If the physician has the opportunity of\nspeaking to the relatives of the patient he hears with pleasure that\nthis esteem is returned. At home the patient never tires of praising the\nphysician, of prizing advantages which he constantly discovers. \"He\nadores you, he trusts you blindly, everything you say is a revelation to\nhim,\" the relatives say. Here and there one of the chorus observes more\nkeenly and remarks, \"It is a positive bore to hear him talk, he speaks\nonly of you; you are his only subject of conversation.\"\nLet us hope that the physician is modest enough to ascribe the patient's\nestimation of his personality to the encouragement that has been offered\nhim and to the widening of his intellectual horizon through the\nastounding and liberating revelations which the cure entails. Under\nthese conditions analysis progressed splendidly. The patient understands\nevery suggestion, he concentrates on the problems that the treatment\nrequires him to solve, reminiscences and ideas flood his mind. The\nphysician is surprised by the certainty and depth of these\ninterpretations and notices with satisfaction how willingly the sick man\nreceives the new psychological facts which are so hotly contested by the\nhealthy persons in the world outside. An objective improvement in the\ncondition of the patient, universally admitted, goes hand in hand with\nthis harmonious relation of the physician to the patient under analysis.\nBut we cannot always expect to have fair weather. There comes a day when\nthe storm breaks. Difficulties turn up in the treatment. The patient\nasserts that he can think of nothing more. We are under the impression\nthat he is no longer interested in the work, that he lightly passes over\nthe injunction that, heedless of any critical impulse, he must say\neverything that comes to his mind. He behaves as though he were not\nunder treatment, as though he had closed no agreement with the\nphysician; he is clearly obsessed by something he does not wish to\ndivulge. This is a situation which endangers the success of the\ntreatment. We are distinctly confronted with a tremendous resistance.\nWhat can have happened?\nProvided we are able once more to clarify the situation, we recognize\nthe cause of the disturbance to have been intense affectionate\nemotions, which the patient has transferred to the physician. This is\ncertainly not justified either by the behavior of the physician or by\nthe relations the treatment has created. The way in which this affection\nis manifested and the goals it strives for will depend on the personal\naffiliations of the two parties involved. When we have here a young girl\nand a man who is still young we receive the impression of normal love.\nWe find it quite natural that a girl should fall in love with a man with\nwhom she is alone a great deal, with whom she discusses intimate\nmatters, who appears to her in the advantageous light of a beneficent\nadviser. In this we probably overlook the fact that in a neurotic girl\nwe should rather presuppose a derangement in her capacity to love. The\nmore the personal relations of physician and patient diverge from this\nhypothetical case, the more are we puzzled to find the same emotional\nrelation over and over again. We can understand that a young woman,\nunhappy in her marriage, develops a serious passion for her physician,\nwho is still free; that she is ready to seek divorce in order to belong\nto him, or even does not hesitate to enter into a secret love affair, in\ncase the conventional obstacles loom too large. Similar things are known\nto occur outside of psychoanalysis. Under these circumstances, however,\nwe are surprised to hear women and girls make remarks that reveal a\ncertain attitude toward the problems of the cure. They always knew that\nlove alone could cure them, and from the very beginning of their\ntreatment they anticipated that this relationship would yield them what\nlife had denied. This hope alone has spurred them on to exert themselves\nduring the treatments, to overcome all the difficulties in communicating\ntheir disclosures. We add on our own account--\"and to understand so\neasily everything that is generally most difficult to believe.\" But we\nare amazed by such a confession; it upsets our calculations completely.\nCan it be that we have omitted the most important factor from our\nhypothesis?\nAnd really, the more experience we gain, the less we can deny this\ncorrection, which shames our knowledge. The first few times we could\nstill believe that the analytic cure had met with an accidental\ninterruption, not inherent to its purpose. But when this affectionate\nrelation between physician and patient occurs regularly in every new\ncase, under the most unfavorable conditions and even under grotesque\ncircumstances; when it occurs in the case of the elderly woman, and is\ndirected toward the grey-beard, or to one in whom, according to our\njudgment, no seductive attractions exist, we must abandon the idea of an\naccidental interruption, and realize that we are dealing with a\nphenomenon which is closely interwoven with the nature of the illness.\nThe new fact which we recognize unwillingly is termed _transference_. We\nmean a transference of emotions to the person of the physician, because\nwe do not believe that the situation of the cure justifies the genesis\nof such feelings. We rather surmise that this readiness toward emotion\noriginated elsewhere, that it was prepared within the patient, and that\nthe opportunity given by analytic treatment caused it to be transferred\nto the person of the physician. Transference may occur as a stormy\ndemand for love or in a more moderate form; in place of the desire to be\nhis mistress, the young girl may wish to be adopted as the favored\ndaughter of the old man, the libidinous desire may be toned down to a\nproposal of inseparable but ideal and platonic friendship. Some women\nunderstand how to sublimate the transference, how to modify it until it\nattains a kind of fitness for existence; others manifest it in its\noriginal, crude and generally impossible form. But fundamentally it is\nalways the same and can never conceal that its origin is derived from\nthe same source.\nBefore we ask ourselves how we can accommodate this new fact, we must\nfirst complete its description. What happens in the case of male\npatients? Here we might hope to escape the troublesome infusion of sex\ndifference and sex attraction. But the answer is pretty much the same as\nwith women patients. The same relation to the physician, the same\nover-estimation of his qualities, the same abandon of interest toward\nhis affairs, the same jealousy toward all those who are close to him.\nThe sublimated forms of transference are more frequent in men, the\ndirect sexual demand is rarer to the extent to which manifest\nhomosexuality retreats before the methods by which these instinct\ncomponents may be utilized. In his male patients more often than in his\nwomen patients, the physician observes a manifestation of transference\nwhich at first sight seems to contradict everything previously\ndescribed: a hostile or _negative_ transference.\nIn the first place, let us realize that the transference occurs in the\npatient at the very outset of the treatment and is, for a time, the\nstrongest impetus to work. We do not feel it and need not heed it as\nlong as it acts to the advantage of the analysis we are working out\ntogether. When it turns into resistance, however, we must pay attention\nto it. Then we discover that two contrasting conditions have changed\ntheir relation to the treatment. In the first place there is the\ndevelopment of an affectionate inclination, clearly revealing the signs\nof its origin in sexual desire which becomes so strong as to awaken an\ninner resistance against it. Secondly, there are the hostile instead of\nthe tender impulses. The hostile feelings generally appear later than\nthe affectionate impulses or succeed them. When they occur\nsimultaneously they exemplify the ambivalence of emotions which exists\nin most of the intimate relations between all persons. The hostile\nfeelings connote an emotional attachment just as do the affectionate\nimpulses, just as defiance signifies dependence as well as does\nobedience, although the activities they call out are opposed. We cannot\ndoubt but that the hostile feelings toward the physician deserve the\nname of transference, since the situation which the treatment creates\ncertainly could not give sufficient cause for their origin. This\nnecessary interpretation of negative transference assures us that we\nhave not mistaken the positive or affectionate emotions that we have\nsimilarly named.\nThe origin of this transference, the difficulties it causes us, the\nmeans of overcoming it, the use we finally extract from it--these\nmatters must be dealt with in the technical instruction of\npsychoanalysis, and can only be touched upon here. It is out of the\nquestion to yield to those demands of the patient which take root from\nthe transference, while it would be unkind to reject them brusquely or\neven indignantly. We overcome transference by proving to the patient\nthat his feelings do not originate in the present situation, and are not\nintended for the person of the physician, but merely repeat what\nhappened to him at some former time. In this way we force him to\ntransform his repetition into a recollection. And so transference, which\nwhether it be hostile or affectionate, seems in every case to be the\ngreatest menace of the cure, really becomes its most effectual tool,\nwhich aids in opening the locked compartments of the psychic life. But I\nshould like to tell you something which will help you to overcome the\nastonishment you must feel at this unexpected phenomenon. We must not\nforget that this illness of the patient which we have undertaken to\nanalyze is not consummated or, as it were, congealed; rather it is\nsomething that continues its development like a living being. The\nbeginning of the treatment does not end this development. When the cure,\nhowever, first has taken possession of the patient, the productivity of\nthe illness in this new phase is concentrated entirely on one aspect:\nthe relation of the patient to the physician. And so transference may be\ncompared to the cambrium layer between the wood and the bark of a tree,\nfrom which the formation of new tissues and the growth of the trunk\nproceed at the same time. When the transference has once attained this\nsignificance the work upon the recollections of the patient recedes into\nthe background. At that point it is correct to say that we are no longer\nconcerned with the patient's former illness, but with a newly created,\ntransformed neurosis, in place of the former. We followed up this new\nedition of an old condition from the very beginning, we saw it originate\nand grow; hence we understand it especially well, because we ourselves\nare the center of it, its object. All the symptoms of the patient have\nlost their original meaning and have adapted themselves to a new\nmeaning, which is determined by its relation to transference. Or, only\nsuch symptoms as are capable of this transformation have persisted. The\ncontrol of this new, artificial neurosis coincides with the removal of\nthe illness for which treatment was sought in the first place, namely,\nwith the solution of our therapeutic problem. The human being who, by\nmeans of his relations to the physician, has freed himself from the\ninfluences of suppressed impulses, becomes and stays free in his\nindividual life, when the influence of the physician is subsequently\nremoved.\nTransference has attained extraordinary significance, has become the\ncentre of the cure, in the conditions of hysteria, anxiety and\ncompulsion neuroses. Their conditions therefore are properly included\nunder the term transference neuroses. Whoever in his analytic experience\nhas come into contact with the existence of transference can no longer\ndoubt the character of those suppressed impulses that express\nthemselves in the symptoms of these neuroses and requires no stronger\nproof of their libidinous character. We may say that our conviction that\nthe meaning of the symptoms is substituted libidinous gratification was\nfinally confirmed by this explanation of transference.\nNow we have every reason to correct our former dynamic conception of the\nhealing process, and to bring it into harmony with our new discernment.\nIf the patient is to fight the normal conflict that our analysis has\nrevealed against the suppressions, he requires a tremendous impetus to\ninfluence the desirable decision which will lead him back to health.\nOtherwise he might decide for a repetition of the former issue and allow\nthose factors which have been admitted to consciousness to slip back\nagain into suppression. The deciding vote in this conflict is not given\nby his intellectual penetration--which is neither strong nor free enough\nfor such an achievement--but only by his relation to the physician.\nInasmuch as his transference carries a positive sign, it invests the\nphysician with authority and is converted into faith for his\ncommunications and conceptions. Without transference of this sort, or\nwithout a negative transfer, he would not even listen to the physician\nand to his arguments. Faith repeats the history of its own origin; it is\na derivative of love and at first requires no arguments. When they are\noffered by a beloved person, arguments may later be admitted and\nsubjected to critical reflection. Arguments without such support avail\nnothing, and never mean anything in life to most persons. Man's\nintellect is accessible only in so far as he is capable of libidinous\noccupation with an object, and accordingly we have good ground to\nrecognize and to fear the limit of the patient's capacity for being\ninfluenced by even the best analytical technique, namely, the extent of\nhis narcism.\nThe capacity for directing libidinous occupation with objects towards\npersons as well must also be accorded to all normal persons. The\ninclination to transference on the part of the neurotic we have\nmentioned, is only an extraordinary heightening of this common\ncharacteristic. It would be strange indeed if a human trait so\nwide-spread and significant had never been noticed and turned to\naccount. But that has been done. Bernheim, with unerring perspicacity,\nbased his theory of hypnotic manifestations on the statement that all\npersons are open to suggestion in some way or other. Suggestibility in\nhis sense is nothing more than an inclination to transference, bounded\nso narrowly that there is no room for any negative transfer. But\nBernheim could never define suggestion or its origin. For him it was a\nfundamental fact, and he could never tell us anything regarding its\norigin. He did not recognize the dependence of suggestibility upon\nsexuality and the activity of the libido. We, on the other hand, must\nrealize that we have excluded hypnosis from our technique of neurosis\nonly to rediscover suggestion in the shape of transference.\nBut now I shall pause and let you put in a word. I see that an objection\nis looming so large within you that if it were not voiced you would be\nunable to listen to me. \"So at last you confess that like the\nhypnotists, you work with the aid of suggestion. That is what we have\nbeen thinking for a long time. But why choose the detour over\nreminiscences of the past, revealing of the unconscious, interpretation\nand retranslation of distortions, the tremendous expenditure of time and\nmoney, if the only efficacious thing is suggestion? Why do you not use\nsuggestion directly against symptoms, as the others do, the honest\nhypnotists? And if, furthermore, you offer the excuse that by going your\nway you have made numerous psychological discoveries which are not\nrevealed by direct suggestion, who shall vouch for their accuracy? Are\nnot they, too, a result of suggestion, that is to say, of unintentional\nsuggestion? Can you not, in this realm also, thrust upon the patient\nwhatever you wish and whatever you think is so?\"\nYour objections are uncommonly interesting, and must be answered. But I\ncannot do it now for lack of time. Till the next time, then. You shall\nsee, I shall be accountable to you. Today I shall only end what I have\nbegun. I promised to explain, with the aid of the factor of\ntransference, why our therapeutic efforts have not met with success in\nnarcistic neuroses.\nThis I can do in a few words and you will see how simply the riddle can\nbe solved, how well everything harmonizes. Observation shows that\npersons suffering from narcistic neuroses have no capacity for\ntransference, or only insufficient remains of it. They reject the\nphysician not with hostility, but with indifference. That is why he\ncannot influence them. His words leave them cold, make no impression,\nand so the mechanism of the healing process, which we are able to set\nin motion elsewhere, the renewal of the pathogenic conflict and the\novercoming of the resistance to the suppression, cannot be reproduced in\nthem. They remain as they are. Frequently they are known to attempt a\ncure on their own account, and pathological results have ensued. We are\npowerless before them.\nOn the basis of our clinical impressions of these patients, we asserted\nthat in their case libidinous occupation with objects must have been\nabandoned, and object-libido must have been transformed into ego-libido.\nOn the strength of this characteristic we had separated it from the\nfirst group of neurotics (hysteria, anxiety and compulsion neuroses).\nTheir behavior under attempts at therapy confirms this supposition. They\nshow no neurosis. They, therefore, are inaccessible to our efforts and\nwe cannot cure them.\nTWENTY-EIGHTH LECTURE\nGENERAL THEORY OF THE NEUROSES\n_Analytical Therapy_\nYou know our subject for today. You asked me why we do not make use of\ndirect suggestion in psychoanalytic therapy, when we admit that our\ninfluence depends substantially upon transference, i.e., suggestion, for\nyou have come to doubt whether or not we can answer for the objectivity\nof our psychological discoveries in the face of such a predominance of\nsuggestion. I promised to give you a comprehensive answer.\nDirect suggestion is suggestion directed against the expression of the\nsymptoms, a struggle between your authority and the motives of the\ndisease. You pay no attention during this process to the motives, but\nonly demand of the patient that he suppress their expression in\nsymptoms. So it makes no difference in principle whether you hypnotize\nthe patient or not. Bernheim, with his usual perspicacity, asserted that\nsuggestion is the essential phenomenon underlying hypnotism, that\nhypnotism itself is already a result of suggestion, is a suggested\ncondition. Bernheim was especially fond of practising suggestion upon a\nperson in the waking state, and could achieve the same results as with\nsuggestion under hypnosis.\nWhat shall I deal with first, the evidence of experience or theoretic\nconsiderations?\nLet us begin with our experiences. I was a pupil of Bernheim's, whom I\nsought out in Nancy in 1889, and whose book on suggestion I translated\ninto German. For years I practised hypnotic treatment, at first by means\nof prohibitory suggestions alone, and later by this method in\ncombination with investigation of the patient after the manner of\nBreuer. So I can speak from experience about the results of hypnotic or\nsuggestive therapy. If we judge Bernheim's method according to the old\ndoctor's password that an ideal therapy must be rapid, reliable and not\nunpleasant for the patient, we find it fulfills at least two of these\nrequirements. It can be carried out much more rapidly, indescribably\nmore rapidly than the analytic method, and it brings the patient neither\ntrouble nor discomfort. In the long run it becomes monotonous for the\nphysician, since each case is exactly the same; continually forbidding\nthe existence of the most diverse symptoms under the same ceremonial,\nwithout being able to grasp anything of their meaning or their\nsignificance. It is second-rate work, not scientific activity, and\nreminiscent of magic, conjuring and hocus-pocus; yet in the face of the\ninterest of the patient this cannot be considered. The third requisite,\nhowever, was lacking. The procedure was in no way reliable. It might\nsucceed in one case, and fail with the next; sometimes much was\naccomplished, at other times little, one knew not why. Worse than this\ncapriciousness of the technique was the lack of permanency of the\nresults. After a short time, when the patient was again heard from, the\nold malady had reappeared, or it had been replaced by a new malady. We\ncould start in again to hypnotize. At the same time we had been warned\nby those who were experienced that by frequent repetitions of hypnotism\nwe would deprive the patient of his self-reliance and accustom him to\nthis therapy as though it were a narcotic. Granted that we did\noccasionally succeed as well as one could wish; with slight trouble we\nachieved complete and permanent results. But the conditions for such a\nfavorable outcome remained unknown. I have had it happen that an\naggravated condition which I had succeeded in clearing up completely by\na short hypnotic treatment returned unchanged when the patient became\nangry and arbitrarily developed ill feeling against me. After a\nreconciliation I was able to remove the malady anew and with even\ngreater thoroughness, yet when she became hostile to me a second time it\nreturned again. Another time a patient whom I had repeatedly helped\nthrough nervous conditions by hypnosis, during the treatment of an\nespecially stubborn attack, suddenly threw her arms around my neck. This\nmade it necessary to consider the question, whether one wanted to or\nnot, of the nature and source of the suggestive authority.\nSo much for experience. It shows us that in renouncing direct suggestion\nwe have given up nothing that is not replaceable. Now let us add a few\nfurther considerations. The practice of hypnotic therapy demands only a\nslight amount of work of the patient as well as of the physician. This\ntherapy fits in perfectly with the estimation of neuroses to which the\nmajority of physicians subscribe. The physician says to the neurotic,\n\"There is nothing the matter with you; you are only nervous, and so I\ncan blow away all your difficulties with a few words in a few minutes.\"\nBut it is contrary to our dynamic conceptions that we should be able to\nmove a great weight by an inconsiderable force, by attacking it directly\nand without the aid of appropriate preparations. So far as conditions\nare comparable, experience shows us that this performance does not\nsucceed with the neurotic. But I know this argument is not unassailable;\nthere are also \"redeeming features.\"\nIn the light of the knowledge we have gained from psychoanalysis we can\ndescribe the difference between hypnotic and psychoanalytic suggestion\nas follows: Hypnotic therapy seeks to hide something in psychic life,\nand to gloss it over; analytic therapy seeks to lay it bare and to\nremove it. The first method works cosmetically, the other surgically.\nThe first uses suggestion in order to prevent the appearance of the\nsymptoms, it strengthens suppression, but leaves unchanged all other\nprocesses that have led to symptom development. Analytic therapy attacks\nthe illness closer to its sources, namely in the conflicts out of which\nthe symptoms have emerged, it makes use of suggestion to change the\nsolution of these conflicts. Hypnotic therapy leaves the patient\ninactive and unchanged, and therefore without resistance to every new\noccasion for disease. Analytic treatment places upon the physician, as\nwell as upon the patient, a difficult responsibility; the inner\nresistance of the patient must be abolished. The psychic life of the\npatient is permanently changed by overcoming these resistances, it is\nlifted upon a higher plane of development and remains protected against\nnew possibilities of disease. The work of overcoming resistance is the\nfundamental task of the analytic cure. The patient, however, must take\nit on himself to accomplish this, while the physician, with the aid of\nsuggestion, makes it possible for him to do so. The suggestion works in\nthe nature of an _education_. We are therefore justified in saying that\nanalytic treatment is a sort of _after-education_.\nI hope I have made it clear to you wherein our technique of using\nsuggestion differs therapeutically from the only use possible in\nhypnotic therapy. With your knowledge of the relation between suggestion\nand transference you will readily understand the capriciousness of\nhypnotic therapy which attracted our attention, and you will see why, on\nthe other hand, analytic suggestion can be relied upon to its limits. In\nhypnosis we depend on the condition of the patient's capacity for\ntransference, yet we are unable to exert any influence on this capacity.\nThe transference of the subject may be negative, or, as is most\nfrequent, ambivalent; the patient may have protected himself against\nsuggestion by very special adjustments, yet we are unable to learn\nanything concerning them. In psychoanalysis we work with the\ntransference itself, we do away with the forces opposing it, prepare the\ninstrument with which we are to work. So it becomes possible to derive\nentirely new uses from the power of suggestion; we are able to control\nit, the patient does not work himself into any state of mind he pleases,\nbut in so far as we are able to influence him at all, we can guide the\nsuggestion.\nNow you will say, regardless of whether we call the driving force of our\nanalysis transference or suggestion, there is still the danger that\nthrough our influence on the patient the objective certainty of our\ndiscoveries becomes doubtful. That which becomes a benefit to therapy\nworks harm to the investigation. This objection is most often raised\nagainst psychoanalysis, and it must be admitted that even if it does not\nhit the mark, it cannot be waved aside as stupid. But if it were\njustified, psychoanalysis would be nothing more than an extraordinarily\nwell disguised and especially workable kind of treatment by suggestion,\nand we may lay little weight upon all its assertions concerning the\ninfluences of life, psychic dynamics, and the unconscious. This is in\nfact the opinion held by our opponents; we are supposed especially to\nhave \"balked into\" the patients everything that supports the importance\nof sexual experiences, and often the experiences themselves, after the\ncombinations themselves have grown up in our degenerate imaginations. We\ncan refute these attacks most easily by calling on the evidence of\nexperience rather than by resorting to theory. Anyone who has himself\nperformed a psychoanalysis has been able to convince himself innumerable\ntimes that it is impossible thus to suggest anything to the patient.\nThere is no difficulty, of course, in making the patient a disciple of\nany one theory, and thus causing him to share the possible error of the\nphysician. With respect to this he behaves just like any other person,\nlike a student, but he has influenced only his intelligence, not his\ndisease. The solving of his conflicts and the overcoming of his\nresistances succeeds only if we have aroused in him representations of\nsuch expectations as can agree with reality. What was inapplicable in\nthe assumptions of the physician falls away during the course of the\nanalysis; it must be withdrawn and replaced by something more nearly\ncorrect. By employing a careful technique we seek to prevent the\noccurrence of temporary results arising out of suggestion, yet there is\nno harm if such temporary results occur, for we are never satisfied with\nearly successes. We do not consider the analysis finished until all the\nobscurities of the case are cleared up, all amnestic gaps filled out and\nthe occasions which originally called out the suppressions discovered.\nWe see in results that are achieved too quickly a hindrance rather than\na furtherance of analytic work and repeatedly we undo these results\nagain by purposely breaking up the transference upon which they rest.\nFundamentally it is this feature which distinguishes analytical\ntreatment from the purely suggestive technique and frees analytic\nresults from the suspicion of having been suggested. Under every other\nsuggestive treatment the transference itself is most carefully upheld\nand the influence left unquestioned; in analytic treatment, however, the\ntransference becomes the subject of treatment and is subject to\ncriticism in whatever form it may appear. At the end of an analytic cure\nthe transference itself must be abolished; therefore the effect of the\ntreatment, whether positive or negative, must be founded not upon\nsuggestion but upon the overcoming of inner resistances, upon the inner\nchange achieved in the patient, which the aid of suggestion has made\npossible.\nPresumably the creation of the separate suggestions is counteracted, in\nthe course of the cure, by our being continually forced to attack\nresistances which have the ability to change themselves into negative\n(hostile) transferences. Furthermore, let me call your attention to the\nfact that a large number of results of analysis, otherwise perhaps\nsubject to the suspicion that they are products of suggestion, can be\nconfirmed from other unquestionable sources. As authoritative witnesses\nin this case we refer to the testimony of dements and paranoiacs, who\nare, naturally far removed from any suspicion of suggestive influence.\nWhatever these patients can tell us about symbolic translations and\nphantasies which have forced their way into their consciousness agrees\nfaithfully with the results of our investigations upon the unconscious\nof transference-neurotics, and this gives added weight to the objective\ncorrectness of our interpretations which are so often doubted. I believe\nyou will not go wrong if you give your confidence to analysis with\nreference to these factors.\nWe now want to complete our statement concerning the mechanism of\nhealing, by including it within the formulae of the libido theory. The\nneurotic is incapable both of enjoyment and work; first, because his\nlibido is not directed toward any real object, and second because he\nmust use up a great deal of his former energy to keep his libido\nsuppressed and to arm himself against its attacks. He would become well\nif there could be an end to the conflict between his ego and his libido,\nand if his ego could again have the libido at its disposal. The task of\ntherapy, therefore, consists of freeing the libido from its present\nbonds, which have estranged it from the ego, and furthermore to bring it\nonce more into the service of the ego. Where is the libido of the\nneurotics? It is easy to find; it is bound to the symptoms which at that\ntime furnish it with the only available substitute satisfaction. We have\nto become master of the symptoms, and abolish them, which is of course\nexactly what the patient asks us to do. To abolish the symptoms it\nbecomes necessary to go back to their origin, to renew the conflict out\nof which they emerged, but this time with the help of motive forces that\nwere originally not available, to guide it toward a new solution. This\nrevision of the process of suppression can be accomplished only in part\nby following the traces in memory of the occurrences which led to the\nsuppression. The decisive part of the cure is accomplished by means of\nthe relationship to the physician, the transference, by means of which\nnew editions of the old conflict are created. Under this situation the\npatient would like to behave as he had behaved originally, but by\nsummoning all his available psychic power we compel him to reach a\ndifferent decision. Transference, then, becomes the battlefield on which\nall the contending forces are to meet.\nThe full strength of the libido, as well as the entire resistance\nagainst it, is concentrated in this relationship to the physician; so it\nis inevitable that the symptoms of the libido should be laid bare. In\nplace of his original disturbance the patient manifests the artificially\nconstructed disturbance of transference; in place of heterogeneous\nunreal objects for the libido you now have only the person of the\nphysician, a single object, which, however, is also fantastic. The new\nstruggle over this object is, however, raised to the highest psychic\nlevel with the aid of the physician's suggestions, and proceeds as a\nnormal psychic conflict. By avoiding a new suppression the estrangement\nbetween the ego and the libido comes to an end, the psychic unity of the\npersonality is restored. When the libido again becomes detached from the\ntemporary object of the physician it cannot return to its former\nobjects, but is now at the disposal of the ego. The forces we have\novercome in the task of therapy are on the one hand the aversion of the\nego for certain directions of the libido, which had expressed itself as\na tendency to suppression, and on the other hand the tenacity of the\nlibido, which is loathe to leave an object which it has once occupied.\nAccordingly the work of therapy falls into two phases: first, all the\nlibido is forced from the symptoms into the transference, and\nconcentrated there; secondly, the struggle over this new object is\ncarried on and the libido set free. The decisive change for the better\nin this renewed conflict is the throwing out of the suppression, so that\nthe libido cannot this time again escape the ego by fleeing into the\nunconscious. This is accomplished by the change in the ego under the\ninfluence of the physician's suggestion. In the course of the work of\ninterpretation, which translates unconscious into conscious, the ego\ngrows at the expense of the unconscious; it learns forgiveness toward\nthe libido, and becomes inclined to permit some sort of satisfaction for\nit. The ego's timidity in the face of the demands of the libido is now\nlessened by the prospect of occupying some of the libido through\nsublimation. The more the processes of the treatment correspond to this\ntheoretic description the greater will be the success of psychoanalytic\ntherapy. It is limited by the lack of mobility of the libido, which can\nstand in the way of releasing its objects, and by the obstinate narcism\nwhich will not permit the object-transference to effect more than just\nso much. Perhaps we shall obtain further light on the dynamics of the\nhealing process by the remark that we are able to gather up the entire\nlibido which has become withdrawn from the control of the ego by drawing\na part of it to ourselves in the process of transference.\nIt is to be remembered that we cannot reach a direct conclusion as to\nthe disposition of the libido during the disease from the distributions\nof the libido which are effected during and because of the treatment.\nAssuming that we have succeeded in curing the case by means of the\ncreation and destruction of a strong father-transference to the\nphysician, it would be wrong to conclude that the patient had previously\nsuffered from a similar and unconscious attachment of his libido to his\nfather. The father-transference is merely the battlefield upon which we\nwere able to overcome the libido; the patient's libido had been\nconcentrated here from its other positions. The battlefield need not\nnecessarily have coincided with the most important fortresses of the\nenemy. Defense of the hostile capital need not take place before its\nvery gates. Not until we have again destroyed the transference can we\nbegin to reconstruct the distribution of the libido that existed during\nthe illness.\nFrom the standpoint of the libido theory we might say a last word in\nregard to the dream. The dreams of neurotics, as well as their errors\nand haphazard thoughts, help us in finding the meaning of the symptoms\nand in discovering the disposition of the libido. In the form of the\nwish fulfillment they show us what wish impulses have been suppressed,\nand to what objects the libido, withdrawn from the ego, has been\nattached. That is why interpretation of dreams plays a large role in\npsychoanalytic treatment, and is in many cases, for a long time, the\nmost important means with which we work. We already know that the\ncondition of sleep itself carries with it a certain abatement of\nsuppressions. Because of this lessening of the pressure upon it, it\nbecomes possible for the suppressed impulse to create in the dream a\nmuch clearer expression than the symptom can furnish during the day. So\ndream-study is the easiest approach to a knowledge of the libidinous\nsuppressed unconscious which has been withdrawn from the ego.\nDreams of neurotics differ in no essential point from the dreams of\nnormal persons; you might even say they cannot be distinguished. It\nwould be unreasonable to explain the dreams of the nervous in any way\nwhich could not be applied to the dreams of the normal. So we must say\nthe difference between neurosis and health applies only during the day,\nand does not continue in dream life. We find it necessary to attribute\nto the healthy numerous assumptions which have grown out of the\nconnections between the dreams and the symptoms of the neurotic. We are\nnot in a position to deny that even a healthy man possesses those\nfactors in his psychic life which alone make possible the development of\nthe dream and of the symptom as well. We must conclude, therefore, that\nthe healthy have also made use of suppressions and are put to a certain\namount of trouble to keep those impulses under control; the system of\ntheir unconscious, too, conceals impulses which are suppressed, yet are\nstill possessed of energy, and _a part of their libido is also withdrawn\nfrom the control of their ego_. So the healthy man is virtually a\nneurotic, but dreams are apparently the only symptoms which he can\nmanifest. Yet if we subject our waking hours to a more penetrating\nanalysis we discover, of course, that they refute this appearance and\nthat this seemingly healthy life is shot through with a number of\ntrivial, practically unimportant symptom formations.\nThe difference between nervous health and neurosis is entirely a\npractical one which is determined by the available capacity for\nenjoyment and accomplishment retained by the individual. It varies\npresumably with the relative proportion of the energy totals which have\nremained free and those which have been bound by suppressions, and is\nquantitative rather than qualitative. I do not have to remind you that\nthis conception is the theoretical basis for the certainty that neuroses\ncan be cured, despite their foundation in constitutional disposition.\nThis is accordingly what we may make out of the identity between the\ndreams of the healthy and those of the neurotic for the definition of\nhealth. As regards the dream itself, we must note further that we cannot\nseparate it from its relation to neurotic symptoms. We must recognize\nthat it is not completely defined as a translation of thoughts into an\narchaic form of expression, that is, we must assume it discloses a\ndisposition of libido and of object-occupations which have actually\ntaken place.\nWe have about come to the end. Perhaps you are disappointed that I have\ndealt only with theory in this chapter on psychoanalytic therapy, and\nhave said nothing concerning the conditions under which the cure is\nundertaken, or of the successes which it achieves. But I shall omit\nboth. I shall omit the first because I had intended no practical\ntraining in the practice of psychoanalysis, and I shall neglect the\nsecond for numerous reasons. At the beginning of our talks I emphasized\nthe fact that under favorable circumstances we attain results which can\nbe favorably compared with the happiest achievements in the field of\ninternal therapy, and, I may add, these results could not have been\notherwise achieved. If I were to say more I might be suspected of\nwishing to drown the voices of disparagement, which have become so loud,\nby advertising our claims. We psychoanalysts have repeatedly been\nthreatened by our medical colleagues, even in open congresses, that the\neyes of the suffering public must be opened to the worthlessness of this\nmethod of treatment by a statistical collection of analytic failures and\ninjuries. But such a collection, aside from the biased, denunciatory\ncharacter of its purpose, would hardly be able to give a correct picture\nof the therapeutic values of analysis. Analytic therapy is, as you know,\nstill young; it took a long time to establish the technique, and this\ncould be done only during the course of the work and under the influence\nof accumulating experience. As a result of the difficulties of\ninstruction the physician who begins the practice of psychoanalysis is\nmore dependent upon his capacity to develop on his own account than is\nthe ordinary specialist, and the results he achieves in his first years\ncan never be taken as indicative of the possibilities of analytic\ntherapy.\nMany attempts at treatment failed in the early years of analysis because\nthey were made on cases that were not at all suited to the procedure,\nand which today we exclude by our classification of symptoms. But this\nclassification could be made only after practice. In the beginning we\ndid not know that paranoia and dementia praecox are, in their fully\ndeveloped phases, inaccessible, and we were justified in trying out our\nmethod on all kinds of conditions. Besides, the greatest number of\nfailures in those first years were not due to the fault of the physician\nor because of unsuitable choice of subjects, but rather to the\nunpropitiousness of external conditions. We have hitherto spoken only of\ninternal resistances, those of the patient, which are necessary and may\nbe overcome. External resistances to psychoanalysis, due to the\ncircumstances of the patient and his environment, have little\ntheoretical interest, but are of great practical importance.\nPsychoanalytic treatment may be compared to a surgical operation, and\nhas the right to be undertaken under circumstances favorable to its\nsuccess. You know what precautions the surgeon is accustomed to take: a\nsuitable room, good light, assistance, exclusion of relatives, etc. How\nmany operations would be successful, do you think, if they had to be\nperformed in the presence of all the members of the family, who would\nput their fingers into the field of operation and cry aloud at every cut\nof the knife? The interference of relatives in psychoanalytical\ntreatment is a very great danger, a danger one does not know how to\nmeet. We are armed against the internal resistances of the patient which\nwe recognize as necessary, but how are we to protect ourselves against\nexternal resistance? It is impossible to approach the relatives of the\npatient with any sort of explanation, one cannot influence them to hold\naloof from the whole affair, and one cannot get into league with them\nbecause we then run the danger of losing the confidence of the patient,\nwho rightly demands that we in whom he confides take his part. Besides,\nthose who know the rifts that are often formed in family life will not\nbe surprised as analysts when they discover that the patient's nearest\nrelatives are less interested in seeing him cured than in having him\nremain as he is. Where, as is so often the case, the neurosis is\nconnected with conflicts with members of the family, the healthy member\ndoes not hesitate long in the choice between his own interest and that\nof the cure of the patient. It is not surprising if a husband looks with\ndisfavor upon a treatment in which, as he may correctly suspect, the\nregister of his sins is unrolled; nor are we surprised, and surely we\ncannot take the blame, when our efforts remain fruitless and are\nprematurely broken off because the resistance of the husband is added to\nthat of the sick wife. We had only undertaken something which, under the\nexisting circumstance, it was impossible to carry out.\nInstead of many cases, I shall tell you of just one in which, because of\nprofessional precautions, I was destined to play a sad role. Many years\nago I treated a young girl who for a long time was afraid to go on the\nstreet, or to remain at home alone. The patient hesitatingly admitted\nthat her phantasy had been caused by accidentally observing affectionate\nrelations between her mother and a well-to-do friend of the family. But\nshe was so clumsy--or perhaps so sly--as to give her mother a hint of\nwhat had been discussed during the analysis, and changed her behavior\ntoward her mother, insisting that no one but her mother should protect\nher against the fear of being alone, and anxiously barring the way when\nher mother wished to leave the house. The mother had previously been\nvery nervous herself, but had been cured years before in a hydropathic\nsanatorium. Let us say, in that institution she made the acquaintance of\nthe man with whom she was to enter upon the relationship which was able\nto satisfy her in every respect. Becoming suspicious of the stormy\ndemands of the girl, the mother _suddenly_ realized the meaning of her\ndaughter's fear. She must have made herself sick to imprison her mother\nand to rob her of the freedom she needed to maintain relations with her\nlover. Immediately the mother made an end to the harmful treatment. The\ngirl was put into a sanatorium for the nervous and exhibited for many\nyears as \"a poor victim of psychoanalysis.\" For just as long a period I\nwas pursued by evil slander, due to the unfavorable outcome of this\ncase. I maintained silence because I thought myself bound by the rules\nof professional discretion. Years later I learned from a colleague who\nhad visited the institution, and had seen the agoraphobic girl there,\nthat the relationship between the mother and the wealthy friend of the\nfamily was known all over town, and apparently connived at by the\nhusband and father. It was to this \"secret\" that our treatment had been\nsacrificed.\nIn the years before the war, when the influx of patients from all parts\nmade me independent of the favor or disfavor of my native city, I\nfollowed the rule of not treating anyone who was not _sui juris_, was\nnot independent of all other persons in his essential relations of life.\nEvery psychoanalyst cannot do this. You may conclude from my warning\nagainst the relatives of patients that for purposes of psychoanalysis we\nshould take the patients away from their families, and should limit this\ntherapy to the inmates of sanatoriums. I should not agree with you in\nthis; it is much more beneficial for the patients, if they are not in a\nstage of great exhaustion, to continue in the same circumstances under\nwhich they must master the tasks set for them during the treatment. But\nthe relatives ought not to counteract this advantage by their behavior,\nand above all, they should not antagonize and oppose the endeavors of\nthe physician. But how are we to contend against these influences which\nare so inaccessible to us! You see how much the prospects of a treatment\nare determined by the social surroundings and the cultural conditions of\na family.\nThis offers a sad outlook indeed for the effectiveness of psychoanalysis\nas a therapy, even if we can explain the great majority of our failures\nby putting the blame on such disturbing external factors! Friends of\nanalysis have advised us to counterbalance such a collection of failures\nby means of a statistical compilation on our part of our successful\ncases. Yet I could not try myself to do this. I tried to explain that\nstatistics would be worthless if the collected cases were not\ncomparable, and in fact, the various neuroses which we have undertaken\nto treat could, as a matter of fact, hardly be compared on the same\nbasis, since they differed in many fundamental respects. Besides, the\nperiod of time over which we could report was too short to permit us to\njudge the permanency of our cures, and concerning certain cases we could\nnot have given any information whatever. They related to persons who had\nkept their ailments, as well as their treatment, secret, and whose cure\nmust necessarily be kept secret as well. The strongest hindrance,\nhowever, lay in the knowledge that men behave most irrationally in\nmatters of therapy, and that we have no prospect of attaining anything\nby an appeal to reason. A therapeutic novelty is received either with\nfrenzied enthusiasm, as was the case when Koch first made public his\ntuberculin against tuberculosis, or it is treated with abysmal distrust,\nas was the really blessed vaccination of Jenner, which even today\nretains implacable opponents. There was a very obvious prejudice against\npsychoanalysis. When we had cured a very difficult case we would hear it\nsaid: \"That is no proof, he would have become well by himself in all\nthis time.\" Yet when a patient who had already gone through four cycles\nof depression and mania came into my care during a temporary cessation\nin the melancholia, and three weeks later found herself in the\nbeginnings of a new attack, all the members of the family as well as the\nhigh medical authorities called into consultation, were convinced that\nthe new attack could only be the result of the attempted analysis.\nAgainst prejudice we are powerless; you see it again in the prejudices\nthat one group of warring nations has developed against the other. The\nmost sensible thing for us to do is to wait and allow time to wear it\naway. Some day the same persons think quite differently about the same\nthings than before. Why they formerly thought otherwise remains the dark\nsecret.\nIt may be possible that the prejudice against psychoanalysis is already\non the wane. The continual spread of psychoanalytic doctrine, the\nincrease of the number of physicians in many lands who treat\nanalytically, seems to vouch for it. When I was a young physician I was\ncaught in just such a storm of outraged feeling of the medical\nprofession toward hypnosis, treatment by suggestion, which today is\ncontrasted with psychoanalysis by \"sober\" men. Hypnotism did not,\nhowever, as a therapeutic agent, live up to its promises; we\npsychoanalysts may call ourselves its rightful heirs, and we have not\nforgotten the large amount of encouragement and theoretical explanation\nwe owe to it. The injuries blamed upon psychoanalysis are limited\nessentially to temporary aggravation of the conflict when the analysis\nis clumsily handled, or when it is broken off unfinished. You have heard\nour justification for our form of treatment, and you can form your own\nopinion as to whether or not our endeavors are likely to lead to lasting\ninjury. Misuse of psychoanalysis is possible in various ways; above all,\ntransference is a dangerous remedy in the hands of an unconscientious\nphysician. But no professional method of procedure is protected from\nmisuse; a knife that is not sharp is of no use in effecting a cure.\nI have thus reached the end, ladies and gentlemen. It is more than the\ncustomary formal speech when I admit that I am myself keenly depressed\nover the many faults in the lectures I have just delivered. First of\nall, I am sorry that I have so often promised to return to a subject\nonly slightly touched upon at the time, and then found that the context\nhas not made it possible to keep my word. I have undertaken to inform\nyou concerning an unfinished thing, still in the process of development,\nand my brief exposition itself was an incomplete thing. Often I\npresented the evidence and then did not myself draw the conclusion. But\nI could not endeavor to make you masters of the subject. I tried only to\ngive you some explanation and stimulation.\nEND\nINDEX\nAbel, C., 195\nAbel, R., 148\nAbraham, K., 284, 358\nAbstinence, 299\nAccidental and symptomatic acts, 42\nAccumulated and combined errors, 37\nAdler, A., 203, 330, 351\nAgoraphobia, 227, 233\nAlexander, dream of, 65\nAltruism, 360\nAmbivalence, 369\nAmnesia, 244;\nchildhood, 168;\nhysterical, 245;\ninfantile, 245;\nof the neurotic, 244\nAnalyses of dreams, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, 153\nAnalysis, experimental, dream for, 93\nAnalytical therapy, 372, 388\nAndreas, Lou, 272\nAnxiety, 340, 342;\ndream, 183;\nequivalents, 347;\nform of neurotic fear, 346;\nhysteria, 233, 259, 316, 346;\nhysteria, resistance in, 250;\nneurosis, 338, 344, 347\nAnxious expectation, 344\nArchaic remnants and infantilism in the dream, 167\nArt, and the neurosis, 326\nAssociation experiment, 86;\nfree, 84\nAuto-eroticism, 359\nBack, George, 108\nBasedowi, M., 336\nBeheading symbol, 231\nBernheim, 81, 240, 385, 388\nBinet, 302\nBinz, 66\nBirth of the hero, myths, 182\nBirth, the source of fear, 343;\nsymbols of, 132;\ntheories of children, 274\nBleuler, 86, 369\nBloch, Ivan, 265\nBoelsche, W., 307\nBreuer, J., 221, 232, 241, 242, 253, 254, 388\nBreughel, P., 263\nCastration complex, 175\nCensor, dream, 110\nCharcot, 119\nChild, sexual life of, 268, 281\nChildhood amnesia, 168;\ndreams of, 101;\negoism in, 171;\nexperiences, phantasy in, 319;\nloss of memory for, 168;\nprophylaxis, 317\nChildren, fear in, 350;\nsexual curiosity of, 274\nChildren's dreams, 102;\ntheories of birth, 274\nChoice of an object, 368\nClinical problem, 244\nCommon elements of dreams, 67, 69, 75\nComplex, castration, 175;\nfamily, 285;\nOedipus, 174, 285;\nparent, 289\nCompulsion neurosis, 222, 227, 259, 261, 267, 298, 326;\nfear in, 349;\nmanifestations of, 222\nCompulsion neurotics, resistance in, 250, 251;\nsymptoms, analysis of, 224\nCompulsive activity, meaning of, 239;\nacts, 223;\nwashing as, 233\nCondensation, 142\nConflict, role of, in neurosis, 302, 305\nConscious, definition of, 90\nConversion-hysteria, 259, 339\nCriticism of dream, 194;\nof psychoanalysis, reasons for, 246\nDarwin, Charles, 247, 345\nDay dreams, 76, 105, 324\nDeath in dreams, 133;\nwishes, 169\nDefinition of psychoanalysis, 1\nDelusion, 216\nDementia praecox, 339, 358, 363\nDevelopment and regression, theories of, 294\nDiderot, 292\nDifficulties of psychoanalysis, 2, 5\nDisease, secondary advantage of, 334\nDisguise-memories, 168\nDisplacement, 114, 144\nDream, the, 63;\nof Alexander, 65;\nanxiety, 183;\napproaches to study of, 82;\narchaic remnants and infantilism in the, 167;\ncensor, 110;\ncharacter of, 69;\ncriticism of, 194;\nday, 76, 105;\ndefinition of, 67, 68;\ndifficulties and preliminary approach to, 63;\ndistortion in, 101, 110, 183;\ndoubtful points concerning, 194;\nfor experimental analysis, 93;\nhypothesis and technique of interpretation of, 78;\ninfantile, 183;\ninterpretation, rules to be observed in, 91, 92;\nmanifest and latent content of, 90, 96;\nof a prisoner, 109;\nthe reaction to sleep-disturbing stimuli, 70;\nstimuli in, 71, 73;\nsymbolism in, 122\nDreams analysed, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, 153;\nof childhood, 101;\nchildren's, 102;\nchildren's, elements of, 101-5;\ncommon elements of, 67, 69, 75;\ndeath in, 133;\nelaboration in, 74;\nexamples of, 111;\nexperimentally induced in, 71;\nof neurotics, 395;\ntypical, 234;\nvisual forms in, 75;\nwish fulfillment, 107;\ndream-work, 141;\nprocesses of, 142\nDu prel, 108\nEgo, development of, 304;\nimpulses, 303;\ninstincts, 356;\npsychology, 365;\nregressions, 310\nEgoism, 360;\nin childhood, 171\nElements of children's dreams, 101, 102, 103, 104, 105\nErogenous zones, 271\nErotomania, 366\nErrors, accumulated and combined, 37;\nforgetting names, 34;\nforgetting projects, 34;\nlosing and mislaying objects, 36;\nmisreading, 51;\nproved by further developments, 39;\npsychology of, 10, 23;\nrepeated, 37;\nslips of the pen, 49;\nof the tongue, 16, 18;\nexpectant fear, 344\nFact, principle of, 309\nFamily-complex, 289\nFear, 340, 342;\nin children, 350;\nin compulsion neurosis, 349;\nexpectant, 344;\nin hysteria, 348;\nof the manifold, 344;\nneurotic, 341;\nanxiety, form of, 346;\nclinical observations on, 347;\norigin of, 350;\nand real fear, connection between, 350;\nreal, 341;\nand neurotic fear, connection between, 350\nFechner, G.

The accusation reads that\nMrs. C. had carried on an illicit relationship with Karl M. while her\nown husband was on the battlefield, from which he even sent her 70\nKronen a month. Mrs. C. had received _quite a lot of money_ from the\nhusband of the plaintiff, while she and her children had to live in\n_hunger_ and in misery. Friends of her husband had told her that Mrs. C.\nhad visited inns with M. and had caroused there until late at night. The\naccused had even asked the husband of the plaintiff before several\ninfantrymen whether he would not soon get a divorce from his \"old woman\"\nand live with her. Mrs. C.'s housekeeper had also repeatedly seen the\nhusband of the plaintiff in her (Mrs. C.'s) apartment, in complete\nnegligee.\nYesterday Mrs. C. _denied_ before a judge in Leopoldstadt that she even\nknew M; there could be no question of intimate relation between them.\nThe witness, Albertine M., however, testified that Mrs. C. had kissed\nthe husband of the plaintiff and that she had surprised them at it.\nWhen M. was called as a witness in an earlier proceeding he had denied\nany intimate relation to the accused. Yesterday the judge received a\n_letter_ in which the witness retracts the statement he made in the\nfirst proceeding and _admits_ that he had carried on a love affair with\nMrs. C., until last June. He says that he only denied this relationship\nin the former proceeding for the sake of the accused because before the\nproceeding she had come to him and begged on her knees that he should\nsave her and not confess. \"To-day,\" wrote the witness, \"I felt impelled\nto make a full confession to the court, since I have _broken my left\narm_ and this appears to me as the _punishment of God_ for my\ntransgression.\"\nThe judge maintained the penal offense had already become null and void,\nwhereupon the plaintiff withdrew her accusation and the liberation of\nthe accused followed.\n[34] This highly technical concept is explained in _The Interpretation\nof Dreams_, Chap.

{"text": "FORGETTING OF PROPER NAMES\nDuring the year 1898 I published a short essay _On the Psychic\nMechanism of Forgetfulness_.[1] I shall now repeat its contents and\ntake it as a starting-point for further discussion. I have there\nundertaken a psychologic analysis of a common case of temporary\nforgetfulness of proper names, and from a pregnant example of my\nown observation I have reached the conclusion that this frequent\nand practically unimportant occurrence of a failure of a psychic\nfunction--of memory--admits an explanation which goes beyond the\ncustomary utilization of this phenomenon.\nIf an average psychologist should be asked to explain how it happens\nthat we often fail to recall a name which we are sure we know, he would\nprobably content himself with the answer that proper names are more\napt to be forgotten than any other content of memory. He might give\nplausible reasons for this \u201cforgetting preference\u201d for proper names,\nbut he would not assume any deep determinant for the process.\nI was led to examine exhaustively the phenomenon of temporary\nforgetfulness through the observation of certain peculiarities,\nwhich, although not general, can, nevertheless, be seen clearly in\nsome cases. In these there is not only _forgetfulness_, but also\nfalse _recollection_: he who strives for the escaped name brings to\nconsciousness others--substitutive names--which, although immediately\nrecognized as false, nevertheless obtrude themselves with great\ntenacity. The process which should lead to the reproduction of the lost\nname is, as it were, displaced, and thus brings one to an incorrect\nsubstitute.\nNow it is my assumption that the displacement is not left to psychic\narbitrariness, but that it follows lawful and rational paths. In other\nwords, I assume that the substitutive name (or names) stands in direct\nrelation to the lost name, and I hope, if I succeed in demonstrating\nthis connection, to throw light on the origin of the forgetting of\nnames.\nIn the example which I selected for analysis in 1898 I vainly strove\nto recall the name of the master who made the imposing frescoes of\nthe \u201cLast Judgment\u201d in the dome of _Orvieto_. Instead of the lost\nname--_Signorelli_--two other names of artists--_Botticelli_ and\n_Boltraffio_--obtruded themselves, names which my judgment immediately\nand definitely rejected as being incorrect. When the correct name was\nimparted to me by an outsider I recognized it at once without any\nhesitation. The examination of the influence and association paths\nwhich caused the displacement from _Signorelli_ to _Botticelli_ and\n_Boltraffio_ led to the following results:--\n(_a_) The reason for the escape of the name _Signorelli_ is neither\nto be sought in the strangeness in itself of this name nor in the\npsychologic character of the connection in which it was inserted. The\nforgotten name was just as familiar to me as one of the substitutive\nnames--Botticelli--and somewhat more familiar than the other\nsubstitute--Boltraffio--of the possessor of which I could hardly say\nmore than that he belonged to the Milanese School. The connection,\ntoo, in which the forgetting of the name took place appeared to me\nharmless, and led to no further explanation. I journeyed by carriage\nwith a stranger from Ragusa, Dalmatia, to a station in Herzegovina. Our\nconversation drifted to travelling in Italy, and I asked my companion\nwhether he had been in Orvieto and had seen there the famous frescoes\nof----\n(_b_) The forgetting of the name could not be explained until after I\nhad recalled the theme discussed immediately before this conversation.\nThis forgetting then made itself known _as a disturbance of the\nnewly emerging theme caused by the theme preceding it_. In brief,\nbefore I asked my travelling companion if he had been in Orvieto we\nhad been discussing the customs of the Turks living in _Bosnia_ and\n_Herzegovina_. I had related what I heard from a colleague who was\npractising medicine among them, namely, that they show full confidence\nin the physician and complete submission to fate. When one is compelled\nto inform them that there is no help for the patient, they answer:\n\u201c_Sir_ (Herr), what can I say? I know that if he could be saved you\nwould save him.\u201d In these sentences alone we can find the words and\nnames: _Bosnia_, _Herzegovina_, and _Herr_ (sir), which may be inserted\nin an association series between _Signorelli_, _Botticelli_, and\n_Boltraffio_.\n(_c_) I assume that the stream of thoughts concerning the customs\nof the Turks in Bosnia, etc., was able to disturb the next thought,\nbecause I withdrew my attention from it before it came to an end. For\nI recalled that I wished to relate a second anecdote which was next to\nthe first in my memory. These Turks value the sexual pleasure above\nall else, and at sexual disturbances merge into an utter despair which\nstrangely contrasts with their resignation at the peril of losing their\nlives. One of my colleague\u2019s patients once told him: \u201cFor you know, sir\n(Herr), if that ceases, life no longer has any charm.\u201d\nI refrained from imparting this characteristic feature because I did\nnot wish to touch upon such a delicate theme in conversation with a\nstranger. But I went still further; I also deflected my attention from\nthe continuation of the thought which might have associated itself in\nme with the theme \u201cDeath and Sexuality.\u201d I was at that time under the\nafter-effects of a message which I had received a few weeks before,\nduring a brief sojourn in _Trafoi_. A patient on whom I had spent\nmuch effort had ended his life on account of an incurable sexual\ndisturbance. I know positively that this sad event, and everything\nconnected with it, did not come to my conscious recollection on that\ntrip in Herzegovina. However, the agreement between _Trafoi_ and\n_Boltraffio_ forces me to assume that this reminiscence was at that\ntime brought to activity despite all the intentional deviation of my\nattention.\n(_d_) I can no longer conceive the forgetting of the name Signorelli\nas an accidental occurrence. I must recognize in this process the\ninfluence of a _motive_. There were motives which actuated the\ninterruption in the communication of my thoughts (concerning the\ncustoms of the Turks, etc.), and which later influenced me to exclude\nfrom my consciousness the thought connected with them, and which might\nhave led to the message concerning the incident in Trafoi--that is,\nI wanted to forget something, I _repressed_ something. To be sure,\nI wished to forget something other than the name of the master of\nOrvieto; but this other thought brought about an associative connection\nbetween itself and this name, so that my act of volition missed the\naim, and I _forgot the one against my will_, while I _intentionally_\nwished to forget the other. The disinclination to recall directed\nitself against the one content; the inability to remember appeared\nin another. The case would have been obviously simpler if this\ndisinclination and the inability to remember had concerned the same\ncontent. The substitutive names no longer seem so thoroughly justified\nas they were before this explanation. They remind me (after the form of\na compromise) as much of what I wished to forget as of what I wished to\nremember, and show me that my object to forget something was neither a\nperfect success nor a failure.\n(_e_) The nature of the association formed between the lost name and\nthe repressed theme (death and sexuality, etc.), containing the names\nof Bosnia, Herzegovina, and Trafoi, is also very strange. In the scheme\ninserted here, which originally appeared in 1898, an attempt is made to\ngraphically represent these associations.\n[Illustration:\n+------+                                             /-----\\\n|Signor| _elli_           (Bo) tic_elli_      (Bo) l traffio\n+------+                    |                 /      \\--|--/\n|   |                       |                /          |\n|   |                       |    /----------/           |\n|   |                       |   /                       |\n| +---+                     |--/                        |\n| |Her| zegovina and       (Bo) snia                    |\n| +---+                                                 |\n+----+                                                  |\n|Herr| Sir, What can I say, etc.                        |\n+----+       \\                                          |\n\\                                      /--|--\\\nDeath and Sexuality                      Trafoi\n\\                                    \\-----/\n\\                                     /\nRepressed thoughts------------------/\n]\nThe name Signorelli was thus divided into two parts. One pair of\nsyllables (_elli_) returned unchanged in one of the substitutions,\nwhile the other had gained, through the translation of _signor_\n(sir, Herr), many and diverse relations to the name contained in the\nrepressed theme, but was lost through it in the reproduction. Its\nsubstitution was formed in a way to suggest that a displacement took\nplace along the same associations--\u201cHerzegovina and Bosnia\u201d--regardless\nof the sense and acoustic demarcation. The names were therefore treated\nin this process like the written pictures of a sentence which is to be\ntransformed into a picture-puzzle (rebus). No information was given\nto consciousness concerning the whole process, which, instead of the\nname Signorelli, was thus changed to the substitutive names. At first\nsight no relation is apparent between the theme that contained the name\nSignorelli and the repressed one which immediately preceded it.\nPerhaps it is not superfluous to remark that the given explanation does\nnot contradict the conditions of memory reproduction and forgetting\nassumed by other psychologists, which they seek in certain relations\nand dispositions. Only in certain cases have we added another _motive_\nto the factors long recognized as causative in forgetting names,\nand have thus laid bare the mechanism of faulty memory. The assumed\ndispositions are indispensable also in our case, in order to make it\npossible for the repressed element to associatively gain control\nover the desired name and take it along into the repression. Perhaps\nthis would not have occurred in another name having more favourable\nconditions of reproduction. For it is quite probable that a suppressed\nelement continually strives to assert itself in some other way, but\nattains this success only where it meets with suitable conditions. At\nother times the suppression succeeds without disturbance of function,\nor, as we may justly say, without symptoms.\nWhen we recapitulate the conditions for forgetting a name with faulty\nrecollection we find: (1) a certain disposition to forget the same;\n(2) a process of suppression which has taken place shortly before;\nand (3) the possibility of establishing an _outer_ association\nbetween the concerned name and the element previously suppressed. The\nlast condition will probably not have to be much overrated, for the\nslightest claim on the association is apt in most cases to bring it\nabout. But it is a different and farther-reaching question whether such\nouter association can really furnish the proper condition to enable\nthe suppressed element to disturb the reproduction of the desired\nname, or whether after all a more intimate connection between the two\nthemes is not necessarily required. On superficial consideration one\nmay be willing to reject the latter requirement and consider the\ntemporal meeting in perfectly dissimilar contents as sufficient. But\non more thorough examination one finds more and more frequently that\nthe two elements (the repressed and the new one) connected by an outer\nassociation, possess besides a connection in content, and this can also\nbe demonstrated in the example _Signorelli_.\nThe value of the understanding gained through the analysis of the\nexample _Signorelli_ naturally depends on whether we must explain this\ncase as a typical or as an isolated process. I must now maintain that\nthe forgetting of a name associated with faulty recollection uncommonly\noften follows the same process as was demonstrated in the case of\n_Signorelli_. Almost every time that I observed this phenomenon in\nmyself I was able to explain it in the manner indicated above as being\nmotivated by repression.\nI must mention still another view-point in favour of the typical nature\nof our analysis. I believe that one is not justified in separating\nthe cases of name-forgetting with faulty recollection from those in\nwhich incorrect substitutive names have not obtruded themselves. These\nsubstitutive names occur spontaneously in a number of cases; in other\ncases, where they do not come spontaneously, they can be brought to\nthe surface by concentration of attention, and they then show the same\nrelation to the repressed element and the lost name as those that\ncome spontaneously. Two factors seem to play a part in bringing to\nconsciousness the substitutive names: first, the effort of attention,\nand second, an inner determinant which adheres to the psychic material.\nI could find the latter in the greater or lesser facility which forms\nthe required outer associations between the two elements. A great many\nof the cases of name-forgetting without faulty recollection therefore\nbelong to the cases with substitutive name formation, the mechanism\nof which corresponds to the one in the example _Signorelli_. But I\nsurely shall not venture to assert that all cases of name-forgetting\nbelong to the same group. There is no doubt that there are cases of\nname-forgetting that proceed in a much simpler way. We shall represent\nthis state of affairs carefully enough if we assert that _besides the\nsimple forgetting of proper names there is another forgetting which is\nmotivated by repression_.\nII\nFORGETTING OF FOREIGN WORDS\nThe ordinary vocabulary of our own language seems to be protected\nagainst forgetting within the limits of normal function, but it is\nquite different with words from a foreign language. The tendency\nto forget such words extends to all parts of speech. In fact,\ndepending on our own general state and the degree of fatigue, the\nfirst manifestation of functional disturbance evinces itself in the\nirregularity of our control over foreign vocabulary. In a series\nof cases this forgetting follows the same mechanism as the one\nrevealed in the example _Signorelli_. As a demonstration of this I\nshall report a single analysis, characterized, however, by valuable\nfeatures, concerning the forgetting of a word, not a noun, from a Latin\nquotation. Before proceeding, allow me to give a full and clear account\nof this little episode.\nLast summer, while journeying on my vacation, I renewed the\nacquaintance of a young man of academic education, who, as I soon\nnoticed, was conversant with some of my works. In our conversation we\ndrifted--I no longer remember how--to the social position of the race\nto which we both belonged. He, being ambitious, bemoaned the fact that\nhis generation, as he expressed it, was destined to grow crippled, that\nit was prevented from developing its talents and from gratifying its\ndesires. He concluded his passionately felt speech with the familiar\nverse from Virgil: _Exoriare_ ... in which the unhappy _Dido_ leaves\nher vengeance upon _\u00c6neas_ to posterity. Instead of \u201cconcluded,\u201d I\nshould have said \u201cwished to conclude,\u201d for he could not bring the\nquotation to an end, and attempted to conceal the open gap in his\nmemory by transposing the words:--\n\u201c_Exoriar(e) ex nostris ossibus ultor!_\u201d\nHe finally became piqued and said: \u201cPlease don\u2019t make such a mocking\nface, as if you were gloating over my embarrassment, but help me. There\nis something missing in this verse. How does it read in its complete\nform?\u201d\n\u201cWith pleasure,\u201d I answered, and cited it correctly:--\n\u201c_Exoriar(e) aliquis nostris ex ossibus ultor!_\u201d\n\u201cIt is too stupid to forget such a word,\u201d he said. \u201cBy the way, I\nunderstand you claim that forgetting is not without its reasons; I\nshould be very curious to find out how I came to forget this indefinite\npronoun \u2018_aliquis_.\u2019\u201d\nI gladly accepted the challenge, as I hoped to get an addition to\nmy collection, and said, \u201cWe can easily do this, but I must ask you\nto tell me frankly and without any criticism everything that occurs\nto your mind after you focus your attention, without any particular\nintention, on the forgotten word.\u201d[2]\n\u201cVery well, the ridiculous idea comes to me to divide the word in the\nfollowing way: _a_ and _liquis_.\u201d\n\u201cWhat does that mean?\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d\n\u201cWhat else does that recall to you?\u201d\n\u201cThe thought goes on to _reliques_--_liquidation_--_liquidity_--_fluid_.\u201d\n\u201cDoes that mean anything to you now?\u201d\n\u201cNo, not by a long shot.\u201d\n\u201cJust go ahead.\u201d\n\u201cI now think,\u201d he said, laughing sarcastically, \u201cof Simon of Trent,\nwhose relics I saw two years ago in a church in Trent. I think of the\nold accusation which has been brought against the Jews again, and\nof the work of _Kleinpaul_, who sees in these supposed sacrifices\nreincarnations or revivals, so to speak, of the Saviour.\u201d\n\u201cThis stream of thoughts has some connection with the theme which we\ndiscussed before the Latin word escaped you.\u201d\n\u201cYou are right. I now think of an article in an Italian journal which I\nhave recently read. I believe it was entitled: \u2018What St. Augustine said\nConcerning Women.\u2019 What can you do with this?\u201d\nI waited.\n\u201cNow I think of something which surely has no connection with the\ntheme.\u201d\n\u201cOh, please abstain from all criticism, and----\u201d\n\u201cOh, I know! I recall a handsome old gentleman whom I met on my journey\nlast week. He was really an _original_ type. He looked like a big bird\nof prey. His name, if you care to know, is Benedict.\u201d\n\u201cWell, at least you give a grouping of saints and Church fathers: _St.\nSimon_, _St. Augustine_, and _St. Benedict_. I believe that there was a\nChurch father named _Origines_. Three of these, moreover, are Christian\nnames, like _Paul_ in the name _Kleinpaul_.\u201d\n\u201cNow I think of _St. Januarius_ and his blood miracle--I find that the\nthoughts are running mechanically.\u201d\n\u201cJust stop a moment; both _St. Januarius_ and _St. Augustine_ have\nsomething to do with the calendar. Will you recall to me the blood\nmiracle?\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t you know about it? The blood of St. Januarius is preserved in\na phial in a church in Naples, and on a certain holiday a miracle\ntakes place causing it to liquefy. The people think a great deal of\nthis miracle, and become very excited if the liquefying process is\nretarded, as happened once during the French occupation. The General\nin command--or Garibaldi, if I am not mistaken--then took the priest\naside, and with a very significant gesture pointed out to him the\nsoldiers arrayed without, and expressed his hope that the miracle would\nsoon take place. And it actually took place....\u201d\n\u201cWell, what else comes to your mind? Why do you hesitate?\u201d\n\u201cSomething really occurred to me ... but it is too intimate a matter to\nimpart ... besides, I see no connection and no necessity for telling\nit.\u201d\n\u201cI will take care of the connection. Of course I cannot compel you\nto reveal what is disagreeable to you, but then you should not have\ndemanded that I tell you why you forgot the word \u2018_aliquis_.\u2019\u201d\n\u201cReally? Do you think so? Well, I suddenly thought of a woman from whom\nI could easily get a message that would be very annoying to us both.\u201d\n\u201cThat she missed her courses?\u201d\n\u201cHow could you guess such a thing?\u201d\n\u201cThat was not very difficult. You prepared me for it long enough. Just\nthink of the _saints of the calendar, the liquefying of the blood on a\ncertain day, the excitement if the event does not take place, and the\ndistinct threat that the miracle must take place_.... Indeed, you have\nelaborated the miracle of St. Januarius into a clever allusion to the\ncourses of the woman.\u201d\n\u201cIt was surely without my knowledge. And do you really believe that my\ninability to reproduce the word \u2018_aliquis_\u2019 was due to this anxious\nexpectation?\u201d\n\u201cThat appears to me absolutely certain. Don\u2019t you recall dividing\nit into _a-liquis_ and the associations: _reliques_, _liquidation_,\n_fluid_? Shall I also add to this connection the fact that St. Simon,\nto whom you got by way of the _reliques_, was sacrificed as a child?\u201d\n\u201cPlease stop. I hope you do not take these thoughts--if I really\nentertained them--seriously. I will, however, confess to you that the\nlady is Italian, and that I visited Naples in her company. But may not\nall this be coincidental?\u201d\n\u201cI must leave to your own judgment whether you can explain all these\nconnections through the assumption of coincidence. I will tell you,\nhowever, that every similar case that you analyse will lead you to just\nsuch remarkable \u2018coincidences!\u2019\u201d\nI have more than one reason for valuing this little analysis, for\nwhich I am indebted to my travelling companion. First, because in\nthis case I was able to make use of a source which is otherwise\ninaccessible to me. Most of the examples of psychic disturbances\nof daily life that I have here compiled I was obliged to take from\nobservation of myself. I endeavoured to evade the far richer material\nfurnished me by my neurotic patients, because I had to preclude the\nobjection that the phenomena in question were only the result and\nmanifestation of the neurosis. It was therefore of special value for\nmy purpose to have a stranger free from a neurosis offer himself as\na subject for such examination. This analysis is also important in\nother respects, inasmuch as it elucidates a case of word-forgetting\n_without_ substitutive recollection, and thus confirms the principle\nformulated above, namely, that the appearance or nonappearance of\nincorrect substitutive recollections does not constitute an essential\ndistinction[3].\nBut the principal value of the example _aliquis_ lies in another of\nits distinctions from the case _Signorelli_. In the latter example the\nreproduction of the name becomes disturbed through the after-effects of\na stream of thought which began shortly before and was interrupted, but\nwhose content had no distinct relation to the new theme which contained\nthe name Signorelli. Between the repression and the theme of the\nforgotten name there existed only the relation of temporal contiguity,\nwhich reached the other in order that the two should be able to form\na connection through an outer association.[4] On the other hand, in\nthe example _aliquis_ one can note no trace of such an independent\nrepressed theme which could occupy conscious thought immediately before\nand then re-echo as a disturbance. The disturbance of the reproduction\nproceeded here from the inner part of the theme touched upon, and was\nbrought about by the fact that unconsciously a contradiction arose\nagainst the wish-idea represented in the quotation.\nThe origin must be construed in the following manner: The speaker\ndeplored the fact that the present generation of his people was being\ndeprived of its rights, and like Dido he presaged that a new generation\nwould take upon itself vengeance against the oppressors. He therefore\nexpressed the wish for posterity. In this moment he was interrupted by\nthe contradictory thought: \u201cDo you really wish so much for posterity?\nThat is not true. Just think in what a predicament you would be if you\nshould now receive the information that you must expect posterity from\nthe quarter you have in mind! No, you want no posterity--as much as you\nneed it for your vengeance.\u201d This contradiction asserts itself, just\nas in the example _Signorelli_, by forming an outer association between\none of his ideation elements and an element of the repressed wish, but\nhere it is brought about in a most strained manner through what seems\nan artificial detour of associations. Another important agreement with\nthe example _Signorelli_ results from the fact that the contradiction\noriginates from repressed sources and emanates from thoughts which\nwould cause a deviation of attention.\nSo much for the diversity and the inner relationship of both paradigms\nof the forgetting of names. We have learned to know a second mechanism\nof forgetting, namely, the disturbance of thought through an inner\ncontradiction emanating from the repression. In the course of this\ndiscussion we shall repeatedly meet with this process, which seems to\nme to be the more easily understood.\nIII\nFORGETTING OF NAMES AND ORDER OF WORDS\nExperiences like those mentioned concerning the process of forgetting\na part of the order of words from a foreign language may cause one\nto wonder whether the forgetting of the order of words in one\u2019s own\nlanguage requires an essentially different explanation. To be sure, one\nis not wont to be surprised if after awhile a formula or poem learned\nby heart can only be reproduced imperfectly, with variations and gaps.\nStill, as this forgetting does not affect equally all the things\nlearned together, but seems to pick out therefrom definite parts, it\nmay be worth our effort to investigate analytically some examples of\nsuch faulty reproductions.\nBrill reports the following example:--\n\u201cWhile conversing one day with a very brilliant young woman she had\noccasion to quote from Keats. The poem was entitled \u2018Ode to Apollo,\u2019\nand she recited the following lines:--\n\u201c\u2018In thy western house of gold\nWhere thou livest in thy state,\nBards, that once sublimely told\nProsaic truths that came too late.\u2019\nShe hesitated many times during the recitation, being sure that\nthere was something wrong with the last line. To her great surprise,\non referring to the book she found that not only was the last line\nmisquoted but that there were many other mistakes. The correct lines\nread as follows:--\nODE TO APOLLO\n\u201c\u2018In thy western _halls_ of gold\n_When_ thou _sittest_ in thy state,\nBards, that _erst_ sublimely told\n_Heroic deeds and sang of fate_.\u2019\nThe words italicized are those that have been forgotten and replaced by\nothers during the recitation.\n\u201cShe was astonished at her many mistakes, and attributed them to a\nfailure of memory. I could readily convince her, however, that there\nwas no qualitative or quantitative disturbance of memory in her case,\nand recalled to her our conversation immediately before quoting these\nlines.\n\u201cWe were discussing the over-estimation of personality among lovers,\nand she thought it was Victor Hugo who said that love is the greatest\nthing in the world because it makes an angel or a god out of a grocery\nclerk. She continued: \u2018Only when we are in love have we blind faith\nin humanity; everything is perfect, everything is beautiful, and\n... everything is so poetically unreal. Still, it is a wonderful\nexperience; worth going through, notwithstanding the terrible\ndisappointments that usually follow. It puts us on a level with the\ngods and incites us to all sorts of artistic activities. We become\nreal poets; we not only memorize and quote poetry, but we often become\nApollos ourselves.\u2019 She then quoted the lines given above.\n\u201cWhen I asked on what occasion she memorized the lines she could\nnot recall. As a teacher of elocution she was wont to memorize so\nmuch and so often that it was difficult to tell just when she had\nmemorized these lines. \u2018Judging by the conversation,\u2019 I suggested,\n\u2018it would seem that this poem is intimately associated with the idea\nof over-estimation of personality of one in love. Have you perhaps\nmemorized this poem when you were in such a state?\u2019 She became\nthoughtful for a while and soon recalled the following facts: Twelve\nyears before, when she was eighteen years old, she fell in love.\nShe met the young man while participating in an amateur theatrical\nperformance. He was at the time studying for the stage, and it was\npredicted that some day he would be a matin\u00e9e idol. He was endowed\nwith all the attributes needed for such a calling. He was well built,\nfascinating, impulsive, very clever, and ... very fickle-minded. She\nwas warned against him, but she paid no heed, attributing it all to\nthe envy of her counsellors. Everything went well for a few months,\nwhen she suddenly received word that her Apollo, for whom she had\nmemorized these lines, had eloped with and married a very wealthy young\nwoman. A few years later she heard that he was living in a Western\ncity, where he was taking care of his father-in-law\u2019s interests.\n\u201cThe misquoted lines are now quite plain. The discussion about the\nover-estimation of personality among lovers unconsciously recalled to\nher a disagreeable experience, when she herself over-estimated the\npersonality of the man she loved. She thought he was a god, but he\nturned out to be even worse than the average mortal. The episode could\nnot come to the surface because it was determined by very disagreeable\nand painful thoughts, but the unconscious variations in the poem\nplainly showed her present mental state. The poetic expressions were\nnot only changed to prosaic ones, but they clearly alluded to the whole\nepisode.\u201d\nAnother example of forgetting the order of words of a poem well known\nto the person I shall cite from Dr. C. G. Jung,[5] quoting the words of\nthe author:--\n\u201cA man wished to recite the familiar poem, \u2018A Pine-tree Stands Alone,\u2019\netc. In the line \u2018He felt drowsy\u2019 he became hopelessly stuck at the\nwords \u2018with the white sheet.\u2019 This forgetting of such a well-known\nverse seemed to me rather peculiar, and I therefore asked him to\nreproduce what came to his mind when he thought of the words \u2018with the\nwhite sheet.\u2019 He gave the following series of associations \u2018The white\nsheet makes one think of a white sheet on a corpse--a linen sheet\nwith which one covers a dead body--[pause]--now I think of a near\nfriend--his brother died quite recently--he is supposed to have died\nof heart disease--he was also very corpulent--my friend is corpulent,\ntoo, and I thought that he might meet the same fate--probably he\ndoesn\u2019t exercise enough--when I heard of this death I suddenly became\nfrightened: the same thing might happen to me, as my own family is\npredisposed to obesity--my grandfather died of heart disease--I, also,\nam somewhat too corpulent, and for that reason I began an obesity cure\na few days ago.\u2019\u201d\nJung remarks: \u201cThe man had unconsciously immediately identified himself\nwith the pine-tree which was covered with a white sheet.\u201d\nFor the following example of forgetting the order of words I am\nindebted to my friend Dr. Ferenczi, of Budapest. Unlike the former\nexamples, it does not refer to a verse taken from poetry, but to a\nself-coined saying. It may also demonstrate to us the rather unusual\ncase where the forgetting places itself at the disposal of discretion\nwhen the latter is in danger of yielding to a momentary desire. The\nmistake thus advances to a useful function. After we have sobered down\nwe justify that inner striving which at first could manifest itself\nonly by way of inability, as in forgetting or psychic impotence.\n\u201cAt a social gathering some one quoted, _Tout comprendre c\u2019est tout\npardonner_, to which I remarked that the first part of the sentence\nshould suffice, as \u2018pardoning\u2019 is an exemption which must be left to\nGod and the priest. One of the guests thought this observation very\ngood, which in turn emboldened me to remark--probably to ensure myself\nof the good opinion of the well-disposed critic--that some time ago I\nthought of something still better. But when I was about to repeat this\nclever idea I was unable to recall it. Thereupon I immediately withdrew\nfrom the company and wrote my concealing thoughts. I first recalled\nthe name of the friend who had witnessed the birth of this (desired)\nthought, and of the street in Budapest where it took place, and then\nthe name of another friend, whose name was Max, whom we usually called\nMaxie. That led me to the word \u2018maxim,\u2019 and to the thought that at\nthat time, as in the present case, it was a question of varying a\nwell-known maxim. Strangely enough, I did not recall any maxim but\nthe following sentence: \u2018_God created man in His own image_,\u2019 and its\nchanged conception, \u2018_Man created God in his own image_.\u2019 Immediately I\nrecalled the sought-for recollection.\n\u201cMy friend said to me at that time in Andrassy Street, \u2018_Nothing human\nis foreign to me_.\u2019 To which I remarked, basing it on psychoanalytic\nexperience, \u2018You should go further and acknowledge _that nothing animal\nis foreign to you_.\u2019\n\u201cBut after I had finally found the desired recollection I was even then\nprevented from telling it in this social gathering. The young wife of\nthe friend whom I had reminded of the animality of the unconscious was\nalso among those present, and I was perforce reminded that she was not\nat all prepared for the reception of such unsympathetic views. The\nforgetting spared me a number of unpleasant questions from her and a\nhopeless discussion, and just that must have been the motive of the\n\u2018temporary amnesia.\u2019\n\u201cIt is interesting to note that as a concealing thought there emerged a\nsentence in which the deity is degraded to a human invention, while in\nthe sought-for sentence there was an allusion to the animal in the man.\nThe _capitis diminutio_ is therefore common to both. The whole matter\nwas apparently only a continuation of the stream of thought concerning\nunderstanding and forgiving which was stimulated by the discussion.\n\u201cThat the desired thought so rapidly appeared may be also due to the\nfact that I withdrew into a vacant room, away from the society in which\nit was censored.\u201d\nI have since then analysed a large number of cases of forgetting\nor faulty reproduction of the order of words, and the consistent\nresult of these investigations led me to assume that the mechanisms\nof forgetting, as demonstrated in the examples \u201c_aliquis_\u201d and \u201c_Ode\nto Apollo_,\u201d are almost of universal validity. It is not always very\nconvenient to report such analyses, for, just as those cited, they\nusually lead to intimate and painful things in the person analysed; I\nshall therefore add no more to the number of such examples. What is\ncommon to all these cases, regardless of the material, is the fact that\nthe forgotten or distorted material becomes connected through some\nassociative road with an unconscious stream of thought, which gives\nrise to the influence that comes to light as forgetting.\nI am now returning to the forgetting of names, concerning which we\nhave so far considered exhaustively neither the casuistic elements nor\nthe motives. As this form of faulty acts can at times be abundantly\nobserved in myself, I am not at a loss for examples. The slight\nattacks of migraine, from which I am still suffering, are wont to\nannounce themselves hours before through the forgetting of names, and\nat the height of the attack, during which I am not forced, however, to\ngive up my work, I am often unable to recall all proper names.\nStill, just such cases as mine may furnish the cause for a strong\nobjection to our analytic efforts. Should not one be forced to conclude\nfrom such observations that the causation of the forgetfulness,\nespecially the forgetting of names, is to be sought in circulatory or\nfunctional disturbances of the brain, and spare himself the trouble of\nsearching for psychologic explanations for these phenomena? Not at all;\nthat would mean to interchange the mechanism of a process, which is the\nsame in all cases, with its variations. But instead of an analysis I\nshall cite a comparison which will settle the argument.\nLet us assume that I was so reckless as to take a walk at night in an\nuninhabited neighbourhood of a big city, and was attacked and robbed\nof my watch and purse. At the nearest police-station I report the\nmatter in the following words: \u201cI was in this or that street, and was\nthere robbed of my watch and purse by _lonesomeness_ and _darkness_.\u201d\nAlthough these words would not express anything that is incorrect,\nI would, nevertheless, run the danger of being considered--judging\nfrom the wording of this report--as not quite right in the head. To\nbe correct, the state of affairs could only be described by saying\nthat, _favoured_ by the lonesomeness of the place and under _cover_ of\ndarkness, I was robbed of my valuables by _unknown malefactors_.\nNow, then, the state of affairs in forgetting names need not be\ndifferent. Favoured by exhaustion, circulatory disturbances, and\nintoxication, I am robbed by an unknown psychic force of the disposal\nover the proper names belonging to my memory; it is the same force\nwhich in other cases may bring about the same failure of memory during\nperfect health and mental capacity.\nWhen I analyse those cases of name-forgetting occurring in myself, I\nfind almost regularly that the name withheld shows some relation to a\ntheme which concerns my own person, and is apt to provoke in me strong\nand often painful emotions. Following the convenient and commendable\npractice of the Zurich School (Bleuler, Jung, Riklin), I might express\nthe same thing in the following form: The name withheld has touched\na \u201cpersonal complex\u201d in me. The relation of the name to my person is\nan unexpected one, and is mostly brought about through superficial\nassociations (words of double meaning and of similar sounds); it may\ngenerally be designated as a side association. A few simple examples\nwill best illustrate the nature of the same:--\n(_a_) A patient requested me to recommend to him a sanatorium in the\nRiviera. I knew of such a place very near Genoa, I also recalled the\nname of the German colleague who was in charge of the place, but the\nplace itself I could not name, well as I believed I knew it. There was\nnothing left to do but ask the patient to wait, and to appeal quickly\nto the women of the family.\n\u201cJust what is the name of the place near Genoa where Dr. X. has his\nsmall institution in which Mrs. So-and-so remained so long under\ntreatment?\u201d\n\u201cOf course you would forget a name of that sort. The name is Nervi.\u201d\nTo be sure, I have enough to do with nerves.\n(_b_) Another patient spoke about a neighbouring summer resort, and\nmaintained that besides the two familiar inns there was a third. I\ndisputed the existence of any third inn, and referred to the fact that\nI had spent seven summers in the vicinity and therefore knew more about\nthe place than he. Instigated by my contradiction, he recalled the\nname. The name of the third inn was \u201cThe Hochwartner.\u201d Of course, I had\nto admit it; indeed, I was forced to confess that for seven summers\nI had lived near this very inn whose existence I had so strenuously\ndenied. But why should I have forgotten the name and the object? I\nbelieve because the name sounded very much like that of a Vienna\ncolleague who practised the same specialty as my own. It touched in me\nthe \u201cprofessional complex.\u201d\n(_c_) On another occasion, when about to buy a railroad ticket on the\nReichenhall Station, I could not recall the very familiar name of the\nnext big railroad station which I had so often passed. I was forced\nto look it up in the time-table. The name was Rosehome (Rosenheim). I\nsoon discovered through what associations I lost it. An hour earlier I\nhad visited my sister in her home near Reichenhall; my sister\u2019s name\nis Rose, hence also a Rosehome. This name was taken away by my \u201cfamily\ncomplex.\u201d\n(_d_) This predatory influence of the \u201cfamily complex\u201d I can\ndemonstrate in a whole series of complexes.\nOne day I was consulted by a young man, a younger brother of one of my\nfemale patients, whom I saw any number of times, and whom I used to\ncall by his first name. Later, while wishing to talk about his visit, I\nforgot his first name, in no way an unusual one, and could not recall\nit in any way. I walked into the street to read the business signs and\nrecognized the name as soon as it met my eyes.\nThe analysis showed that I had formed a parallel between the visitor\nand my own brother which centred in the question: \u201cWould my brother,\nin a similar case, have behaved like him or even more contrarily?\u201d The\nouter connection between the thoughts concerning the stranger and my\nown family was rendered possible through the accident that the name\nof the mothers in each case was the same, Amelia. Subsequently I also\nunderstood the substitutive names, Daniel and Frank, which obtruded\nthemselves without any explanation. These names, as well as Amelia,\nbelong to Schiller\u2019s play _The Robbers_; they are all connected with a\njoke of the Vienna pedestrian, Daniel Spitzer.\n(_e_) On another occasion I was unable to find a patient\u2019s name\nwhich had a certain reference to my early life. The analysis had to\nbe followed over a long devious road before the desired name was\ndiscovered. The patient expressed his apprehension lest he should\nlose his eyesight; this recalled a young man who became blind from a\ngunshot, and this again led to a picture of another youth who shot\nhimself, and the latter bore the same name as my first patient, though\nnot at all related to him. The name became known to me, however, only\nafter the anxious apprehension from these two juvenile cases was\ntransferred to a person of my own family.\nThus an incessant stream of \u201cself-reference\u201d flows through my thoughts\nconcerning which I usually have no inkling, but which betrays itself\nthrough such name-forgetting. It seems as if I were forced to compare\nwith my own person all that I hear about strangers, as if my personal\ncomplexes became stirred up at every information from others. It seems\nimpossible that this should be an individual peculiarity of my own\nperson; it must, on the contrary, point to the way we grasp outside\nmatters in general. I have reasons to assume that other individuals\nmeet with experiences quite similar to mine.\nThe best example of this kind was reported to me by a gentleman named\nLederer as a personal experience. While on his wedding trip in Venice\nhe came across a man with whom he was but slightly acquainted, and\nwhom he was obliged to introduce to his wife. As he forgot the name of\nthe stranger he got himself out of the embarrassment the first time\nby mumbling the name unintelligibly. But when he met the man a second\ntime, as is inevitable in Venice, he took him aside and begged him\nto help him out of the difficulty by telling him his name, which he\nunfortunately had forgotten. The answer of the stranger pointed to a\nsuperior knowledge of human nature: \u201cI readily believe that you did not\ngrasp my name. My name is like yours--Lederer!\u201d\nOne cannot suppress a slight feeling of unpleasantness on discovering\nhis own name in a stranger. I had recently felt it very plainly when I\nwas consulted during my office hours by a man named S. Freud. However,\nI am assured by one of my own critics that in this respect he behaves\nin quite the opposite manner.\n(_f_) The effect of personal relation can be recognized also in the\nfollowing examples reported by Jung.[6]\n\u201cMr. Y. falls in love with a lady who soon thereafter marries Mr. X. In\nspite of the fact that Mr. Y. was an old acquaintance of Mr. X., and\nhad business relations with him, he repeatedly forgot the name, and\non a number of occasions, when wishing to correspond with X., he was\nobliged to ask other people for his name.\u201d\nHowever, the motivation for the forgetting is more evident in this case\nthan in the preceding ones, which were under the constellation of the\npersonal reference. Here the forgetting is manifestly a direct result\nof the dislike of Y. for the happy rival; he does not wish to know\nanything about him.\n(_g_) The following case, reported by Ferenczi, the analysis of which\nis especially instructive through the explanation of the substitutive\nthoughts (like _Botticelli-Boltraffio_ to _Signorelli_), shows in a\nsomewhat different way how self-reference leads to the forgetting of a\nname:--\n\u201cA lady who heard something about psychoanalysis could not recall the\nname of the psychiatrist, Young (Jung).\n\u201cInstead, the following names occurred to her: Kl. (a\nname)--Wilde--Nietzsche--Hauptmann.\n\u201cI did not tell her the name, and requested her to repeat her free\nassociations to every thought.\n\u201cTo Kl. she at once thought of Mrs. Kl., that she was an embellished\nand affected person who looked very well for her age. \u2018She does not\nage.\u2019 As a general and principal conception of Wilde and Nietzsche, she\ngave the association \u2018mental disease.\u2019 She then added jocosely: \u2018The\nFreudians will continue looking for the causes of mental diseases until\nthey themselves become insane.\u2019 She continued: \u2018I cannot bear Wilde\nand Nietzsche. I do not understand them. I hear that they were both\nhomosexual. Wilde has occupied himself with _young_ people\u2019 (although\nshe uttered in this sentence the correct name she still could not\nremember it).\n\u201cTo Hauptmann she associated the words _half_ and _youth_, and only\nafter I called her attention to the word _youth_ did she become aware\nthat she was looking for the name Young (Jung).\u201d\nIt is clear that this lady, who had lost her husband at the age of\nthirty-nine, and had no prospect of marrying a second time, had\ncause enough to avoid reminiscences recalling youth or old age. The\nremarkable thing is that the concealing thoughts of the desired name\ncame to the surface as simple associations of content without any\nsound-associations.\n(_h_) Still different and very finely motivated is an example of\nname-forgetting which the person concerned has himself explained.\n\u201cWhile taking an examination in philosophy as a minor subject I was\nquestioned by the examiner about the teachings of Epicurus, and was\nasked whether I knew who took up his teachings centuries later. I\nanswered that it was Pierre Gassendi, whom two days before while in a\ncaf\u00e9 I had happened to hear spoken of as a follower of Epicurus. To the\nquestion how I knew this I boldly replied that I had taken an interest\nin Gassendi for a long time. This resulted in a certificate with a\n_magna cum laude_, but later, unfortunately, also in a persistent\ntendency to forget the name Gassendi. I believe that it is due to my\nguilty conscience that even now I cannot retain this name despite all\nefforts. I had no business knowing it at that time.\u201d\nTo have a proper appreciation of the intense repugnance entertained by\nour narrator against the recollection of this examination episode, one\nmust have realized how highly he prizes his doctor\u2019s degree, and for\nhow many other things this substitute must stand.\nI add here another example of forgetting the name of a city, an\ninstance which is perhaps not as simple as those given before, but\nwhich will appear credible and valuable to those more familiar with\nsuch investigations. The name of an Italian city withdrew itself\nfrom memory on account of its far-reaching sound-similarity to a\nwoman\u2019s first name, which was in turn connected with various emotional\nreminiscences which were surely not exhaustively treated in this\nreport. Dr. S. Ferenczi, who observed this case of forgetting in\nhimself, treated it--quite justly--as an analysis of a dream or an\nerotic idea.\n\u201cTo-day I visited some old friends, and the conversation turned to\ncities of Northern Italy. Some one remarked that they still showed the\nAustrian influence. A few of these cities were cited. I, too, wished\nto mention one, but the name did not come to me, although I knew that\nI had spent two very pleasant days there; this, of course, does not\nquite concur with Freud\u2019s theory of forgetting. Instead of the desired\nname of the city there obtruded themselves the following thoughts:\n\u2018Capua--Brescia--the lion of Brescia.\u2019 This lion I saw objectively\nbefore me in the form of a marble statue, but I soon noticed that he\nresembled less the lion of the statue of liberty in Brescia (which\nI saw only in a picture) than the other marble lion which I saw in\nLucerne on the monument in honour of the Swiss Guard fallen in the\nTuileries. I finally thought of the desired name: it was Verona.\n\u201cI knew at once the cause of this amnesia. No other than a former\nservant of the family whom I visited at the time. Her name was\nVeronica; in Hungarian Verona. I felt a great antipathy for her on\naccount of her repulsive physiognomy, as well as her hoarse, shrill\nvoice and her unbearable self-assertion (to which she thought herself\nentitled on account of her long service). Also the tyrannical way in\nwhich she treated the children of the family was insufferable to me.\nNow I knew the significance of the substitutive thoughts.\n\u201cTo Capua I immediately associated _caput mortuum_. I had often\ncompared Veronica\u2019s head to a skull. The Hungarian word _kapzoi_ (greed\nafter money) surely furnished a determinant for the displacement.\nNaturally I also found those more direct associations which connected\nCapua and Verona as geographical ideas and as Italian words of the same\nrhythm.\n\u201cThe same held true for Brescia; here, too, I found concealed\nside-tracks of associations of ideas.\n\u201cMy antipathy at that time was so violent that I thought Veronica very\nugly, and have often expressed my astonishment at the fact that any one\nshould love her: \u2018Why, to kiss her,\u2019 I said, \u2018must provoke nausea.\u2019\n\u201cBrescia, at least in Hungary, is very often mentioned not in\nconnection with the lion but with another wild beast. The most hated\nname in this country, as well as in North Italy, is that of General\nHaynau, who is briefly referred to as the hyena of Brescia. From the\nhated tyrant Haynau one stream of thought leads over Brescia to the\ncity of Verona, and the other over the idea of the _grave-digging\nanimal with the hoarse voice_ (which corresponds to the thought of a\nmonument to the dead), to the skull, and to the disagreeable organ\nof Veronica, which was so cruelly insulted in my unconscious mind.\nVeronica in her time ruled as tyrannically as did the Austrian General\nafter the Hungarian and Italian struggles for liberty.\n\u201cLucerne is associated with the idea of the summer which Veronica spent\nwith her employers in a place near Lucerne. The Swiss Guard again\nrecalls that she tyrannized not only the children but also the adult\nmembers of the family, and thus played the part of the \u2018Garde-Dame.\u2019\n\u201cI expressly observe that this antipathy of mine against V. consciously\nbelongs to things long overcome. Since that time she has changed in her\nappearance and manner, very much to her advantage, so that I am able to\nmeet her with sincere regard (to be sure I hardly find such occasion).\nAs usual, however, my unconscious sticks more tenaciously to those\nimpressions; it is old in its resentment.\n\u201cThe Tuileries represent an allusion to a second personality, an old\nFrench lady who actually \u2018guarded\u2019 the women of the house, and who was\nin high regard and somewhat feared by everybody. For a long time I was\nher _\u00e9l\u00e8ve_ in French conversation. The word _\u00e9l\u00e8ve_ recalls that when\nI visited the brother-in-law of my present host in northern Bohemia I\nhad to laugh a great deal because the rural population referred to the\n_\u00e9l\u00e8ves_ (pupils) of the school of forestry as _l\u00f6wen_ (lions). Also\nthis jocose recollection might have taken part in the displacement of\nthe hyena by the lion.\u201d\n(_i_) The following example can also show how a personal complex\nswaying the person at the time being may by devious ways bring about\nthe forgetting of a name.[7]\nTwo men, an elder and a younger, who had travelled together in Sicily\nsix months before, exchanged reminiscences of those pleasant and\ninteresting days.\n\u201cLet\u2019s see, what was the name of that place,\u201d asked the younger, \u201cwhere\nwe passed the night before taking the trip to Selinunt? _Calatafini_,\nwas it not?\u201d\nThe elder rejected this by saying: \u201cCertainly not; but I have forgotten\nthe name, too, although I can recall perfectly all the details of the\nplace. Whenever I hear some one forget a name it immediately produces\nforgetfulness in me. Let us look for the name. I cannot think of any\nother name except _Caltanisetta_, which is surely not correct.\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d said the younger, \u201cthe name begins with, or contains, a _w_.\u201d\n\u201cBut the Italian language contains no _w_,\u201d retorted the elder.\n\u201cI really meant a _v_, and I said _w_ because I am accustomed to\ninterchange them in my mother tongue.\u201d\nThe elder, however, objected to the _v_. He added: \u201cI believe that I\nhave already forgotten many of the Sicilian names. Suppose we try to\nfind out. For example, what is the name of the place situated on a\nheight which was called _Enna_ in antiquity?\u201d\n\u201cOh, I know that: _Castrogiovanni_.\u201d In the next moment the younger\nman discovered the lost name. He cried out \u2018_Castelvetrano_,\u2019 and was\npleased to be able to demonstrate the supposed _v_.\nFor a moment the elder still lacked the feeling of recognition, but\nafter he accepted the name he was able to state why it had escaped him.\nHe thought: \u201cObviously because the second half, _vetrano_, suggests\n_veteran_. I am aware that I am not quite anxious to think of ageing,\nand react peculiarly when I am reminded of it. Thus, _e.g._, I had\nrecently reminded a very esteemed friend in most unmistakable terms\nthat he had \u2018long ago passed the years of youth,\u2019 because before this\nhe once remarked in the most flattering manner, \u2018I am no longer a\nyoung man.\u2019 That my resistance was directed against the second half of\nthe name _Castelvetrano_ is shown by the fact that the initial sound of\nthe same returned in the substitutive name Caltanisetta.\u201d\n\u201cWhat about the name Caltanisetta itself?\u201d asked the younger.\n\u201cThat always seemed to me like a pet name of a young woman,\u201d admitted\nthe elder.\nSomewhat later he added: \u201cThe name for _Enna_ was also only\na substitutive name. And now it occurs to me that the name\n_Castrogiovanni_, which obtruded itself with the aid of a\nrationalization, alludes as expressly to _giovane_, young, as the last\nname, _Castelvetrano_, to _veteran_.\u201d\nThe older man believed that he had thus accounted for his forgetting\nthe name. What the motive was that led the young man to this memory\nfailure was not investigated.\nIn some cases one must have recourse to all the fineness of\npsychoanalytic technique in order to explain the forgetting of a\nname. Those who wish to read an example of such work I refer to a\ncommunication by Professor E. Jones.[8]\nI could multiply the examples of name-forgetting and prolong the\ndiscussion very much further if I did not wish to avoid elucidating\nhere almost all the view-points which will be considered in later\nthemes. I shall, however, take the liberty of comprehending in a few\nsentences the results of the analyses reported here.\nThe mechanism of forgetting, or rather of losing or temporary\nforgetting of a name, consists in the disturbance of the intended\nreproduction of the name through a strange stream of thought\nunconscious at the time. Between the disturbed name and the disturbing\ncomplex there exists a connection either from the beginning or such\na connection has been formed--perhaps by artificial means--through\nsuperficial (outer) associations.\nThe self-reference complex (personal, family or professional) proves to\nbe the most effective of the disturbing complexes.\nA name which by virtue of its many meanings belongs to a number of\nthought associations (complexes) is frequently disturbed in its\nconnection to one series of thoughts through a stronger complex\nbelonging to the other associations.\nTo avoid the awakening of pain through memory is one of the objects\namong the motives of these disturbances.\nIn general one may distinguish two principal cases of name-forgetting;\nwhen the name itself touches something unpleasant, or when it is\nbrought into connection with other associations which are influenced by\nsuch effects. So that names can be disturbed on their own account or\non account of their nearer or more remote associative relations in the\nreproduction.\nA review of these general principles readily convinces us that the\ntemporary forgetting of a name is observed as the most frequent faulty\naction of our mental functions.\nHowever, we are far from having described all the peculiarities of\nthis phenomenon. I also wish to call attention to the fact that\nname-forgetting is extremely contagious. In a conversation between\ntwo persons the mere mention of having forgotten this or that name by\none often suffices to induce the same memory slip in the other. But\nwherever the forgetting is induced, the sought for name easily comes to\nthe surface.\nThere is also a continuous forgetting of names in which whole chains\nof names are withdrawn from memory. If in the course of endeavouring\nto discover an escaped name one finds others with which the latter\nis intimately connected, it often happens that these new names also\nescape. The forgetting thus jumps from one name to another, as if to\ndemonstrate the existence of a hindrance not to be easily removed.\nIV\nCHILDHOOD AND CONCEALING MEMORIES\nIn a second essay[9] I was able to demonstrate the purposive nature\nof our memories in an unexpected field. I started with the remarkable\nfact that the earliest recollections of a person often seemed to\npreserve the unimportant and accidental, whereas (frequently though\nnot universally!) not a trace is found in the adult memory of the\nweighty and affective impressions of this period. As it is known that\nthe memory exercises a certain selection among the impressions at\nits disposal, it would seem logical to suppose that this selection\nfollows entirely different principles in childhood than at the time\nof intellectual maturity. However, close investigation points to the\nfact that such an assumption is superfluous. The indifferent childhood\nmemories owe their existence to a process of displacement. It may be\nshown by psychoanalysis that in the reproduction they represent the\nsubstitute for other really significant impressions, whose direct\nreproduction is hindered by some resistance. As they do not owe their\nexistence to their own contents, but to an associative relation of\ntheir contents to another repressed thought, they deserve the title of\n\u201cconcealing memories,\u201d by which I have designated them.\nIn the aforementioned essay I only touched upon, but in no way\nexhausted, the varieties in the relations and meanings of concealed\nmemories. In the given example fully analysed I particularly emphasized\na peculiarity in the temporal relation between the concealing memory\nand the contents of the memory concealed by it. The content of the\nconcealing memory in that example belonged to one of the first years\nof childhood, while the thoughts represented by it, which remained\npractically unconscious, belonged to a later period of the individual\nin question. I called this form of displacement a retro-active\nor _regressive_ one. Perhaps more often one finds the reversed\nrelation--that is, an indifferent impression of the most remote period\nbecomes a concealing memory in consciousness, which simply owes its\nexistence to an association with an earlier experience, against\nwhose direct reproduction there are resistances. We would call these\n_encroaching_ or _interposing_ concealing memories. What most concerns\nthe memory lies here chronologically beyond the concealing memory.\nFinally, there may be a third possible case, namely, the concealing\nmemory may be connected with the impression it conceals, not only\nthrough its contents, but also through contiguity of time; this is the\n_contemporaneous_ or _contiguous_ concealing memory.\nHow large a portion of the sum total of our memory belongs to the\ncategory of concealing memories, and what part it plays in various\nneurotic hidden processes, these are problems into the value of which I\nhave neither inquired nor shall I enter here. I am concerned only with\nemphasizing the sameness between the forgetting of proper names with\nfaulty recollection and the formation of concealing memories.\nAt first sight it would seem that the diversities of both phenomena are\nfar more striking than their exact analogies. There we deal with proper\nnames, here with complete impressions experienced either in reality\nor in thought; there we deal with a manifest failure of the memory\nfunction, here with a memory act which appears strange to us. Again,\nthere we are concerned with a momentary disturbance--for the name just\nforgotten could have been reproduced correctly a hundred times before,\nand will be so again from to-morrow on; here we deal with lasting\npossession without a failure, for the indifferent childhood memories\nseem to be able to accompany us through a great part of life. In both\nthese cases the riddle seems to be solved in an entirely different way.\nThere it is the forgetting, while here it is the remembering which\nexcites our scientific curiosity.\nAfter deeper reflection one realizes that, although there is a\ndiversity in the psychic material and in the duration of time of the\ntwo phenomena, yet these are by far outweighed by the conformities\nbetween the two. In both cases we deal with the failure of remembering:\nwhat should be correctly reproduced by the memory fails to appear,\nand instead something else comes as a substitute. In the case of\nforgetting a name there is no lack of memory function in the form\nof name substitution. The formation of a concealing memory depends\non the forgetting of other important impressions. In both cases we\nare reminded by an intellectual feeling of the intervention of a\ndisturbance, which in each case takes a different form. In the case\nof forgetting of names we are aware that the substitutive names\nare incorrect, while in concealing memories we are surprised that\nwe have them at all. Hence, if psychologic analysis demonstrates\nthat the substitutive formation in each case is brought about in\nthe same manner--that is, through displacement along a superficial\nassociation--we are justified in saying that the diversities in\nmaterial, in duration of time, and in the centring of both phenomena\nserve to enhance our expectation, that we have discovered something\nthat is important and of general value. This generality purports that\nthe stopping and straying of the reproducing function indicates more\noften than we suppose that there is an intervention of a prejudicial\nfactor, a tendency which favours one memory and at the same time works\nagainst another.\nThe subject of childhood memories appears to me so important and\ninteresting that I would like to devote to it a few additional remarks\nwhich go beyond the views expressed so far.\nHow far back into childhood do our memories reach? I am familiar\nwith some investigations on this question by V. and C. Henri[10] and\nPotwin.[11] They assert that such examinations show wide individual\nvariations, inasmuch as some trace their first reminiscences to\nthe sixth month of life, while others can recall nothing of their\nlives before the end of the sixth or even the eighth year. But what\nconnection is there between these variations in the behaviour of\nchildhood reminiscences, and what signification may be ascribed to\nthem? It seems that it is not enough to procure the material for this\nquestion by simple inquiry, but it must later be subjected to a study\nin which the person furnishing the information must participate.\nI believe we accept too indifferently the fact of infantile\namnesia--that is, the failure of memory for the first years of our\nlives--and fail to find in it a strange riddle. We forget of what\ngreat intellectual accomplishments and of what complicated emotions\na child of four years is capable. We really ought to wonder why the\nmemory of later years has, as a rule, retained so little of these\npsychic processes, especially as we have every reason for assuming that\nthese same forgotten childhood activities have not glided off without\nleaving a trace in the development of the person, but that they have\nleft a definite influence for all future time. Yet in spite of this\nunparalleled effectiveness they were forgotten! This would suggest that\nthere are particularly formed conditions of memory (in the sense of\nconscious reproduction) which have thus far eluded our knowledge. It\nis quite possible that the forgetting of childhood may give us the key\nto the understanding of those amnesias which, according to our newer\nstudies, lie at the basis of the formation of all neurotic symptoms.\nOf these retained childhood reminiscences, some appear to us readily\ncomprehensible, while others seem strange or unintelligible. It is not\ndifficult to correct certain errors in regard to both kinds. If the\nretained reminiscences of a person are subjected to an analytic test,\nit can be readily ascertained that a guarantee for their correctness\ndoes not exist. Some of the memory pictures are surely falsified and\nincomplete, or displaced in point of time and place. The assertions of\npersons examined that their first memories reach back perhaps to their\nsecond year are evidently unreliable. Motives can soon be discovered\nwhich explain the disfigurement and the displacement of these\nexperiences, but they also demonstrate that these memory lapses are not\nthe result of a mere unreliable memory. Powerful forces from a later\nperiod have moulded the memory capacity of our infantile experiences,\nand it is probably due to these same forces that the understanding of\nour childhood is generally so very strange to us.\nThe recollection of adults, as is known, proceeds through different\npsychic material. Some recall by means of visual pictures--their\nmemories are of a visual character; other individuals can scarcely\nreproduce in memory the most paltry sketch of an experience; we\ncall such persons \u201c_auditifs_\u201d and \u201c_moteurs_\u201d in contrast to the\n\u201c_visuels_,\u201d terms proposed by Charcot. These differences vanish\nin dreams; all our dreams are preponderatingly visual. But this\ndevelopment is also found in the childhood memories; the latter are\nplastic and visual, even in those people whose later memory lacks the\nvisual element. The visual memory, therefore, preserves the type of\nthe infantile recollections. Only my earliest childhood memories are\nof a visual character; they represent plastically depicted scenes,\ncomparable only to stage settings.\nIn these scenes of childhood, whether they prove true or false, one\nusually sees his own childish person both in contour and dress. This\ncircumstance must excite our wonder, for adults do not see their\nown persons in their recollections of later experiences.[12] It is,\nmoreover, against our experiences to assume that the child\u2019s attention\nduring his experiences is centred on himself rather than exclusively\non outside impressions. Various sources force us to assume that the\nso-called earliest childhood recollections are not true memory traces\nbut later elaborations of the same, elaborations which might have been\nsubjected to the influences of many later psychic forces. Thus the\n\u201cchildhood reminiscences\u201d of individuals altogether advance to the\nsignification of \u201cconcealing memories,\u201d and thereby form a noteworthy\nanalogy to the childhood reminiscences as laid down in the legends and\nmyths of nations.\nWhoever has examined mentally a number of persons by the method of\npsychoanalysis must have gathered in this work numerous examples\nof concealing memories of every description. However, owing to\nthe previously discussed nature of the relations of the childhood\nreminiscences to later life, it becomes extraordinarily difficult\nto report such examples. For, in order to attach the value of the\nconcealing memory to an infantile reminiscence, it would be often\nnecessary to present the entire life-history of the person concerned.\nOnly seldom is it possible, as in the following good example, to take\nout from its context and report a single childhood memory.\nA twenty-four-year-old man preserved the following picture from the\nfifth year of his life: In the garden of a summer-house he sat on a\nstool next to his aunt, who was engaged in teaching him the alphabet.\nHe found difficulty in distinguishing the letter _m_ from _n_, and he\nbegged his aunt to tell him how to tell one from the other. His aunt\ncalled his attention to the fact that the letter _m_ had one whole\nportion (a stroke) more than the letter _n_. There was no reason to\ndispute the reliability of this childhood recollection; its meaning,\nhowever, was discovered only later, when it showed itself to be the\nsymbolic representation of another boyish inquisitiveness. For just as\nhe wanted to know the difference between _m_ and _n_ at that time,\nso he concerned himself later about the difference between boy and\ngirl, and he would have been willing that just this aunt should be his\nteacher. He also discovered that the difference was a similar one; that\nthe boy again had one whole portion more than the girl, and at the time\nof this recognition his memory awoke to the corresponding childish\ninquisitiveness.\nI would like to show by one more example the sense that may be gained\nby a childhood reminiscence through analytic work, although it may\nseem to contain no sense before. In my forty-third year, when I began\nto interest myself in what remained in my memory of my own childhood,\na scene struck me which for a long time, as I afterwards believed,\nhad repeatedly come to consciousness, and which through reliable\nidentification could be traced to a period before the completion of my\nthird year. I saw myself in front of a chest, the door of which was\nheld open by my half-brother, twenty years my senior. I stood there\ndemanding something and screaming; my mother, pretty and slender, then\nsuddenly entered the room, as if returning from the street.\nIn these words I formulated this scene so vividly seen, which, however,\nfurnished no other clue. Whether my brother wished to open or lock the\nchest (in the first explanation it was a \u201ccupboard\u201d), why I cried,\nand what bearing the arrival of my mother had, all these questions\nwere dim to me; I was tempted to explain to myself that it dealt with\nthe memory of a hoax by my older brother, which was interrupted by my\nmother. Such misunderstandings of childhood scenes retained in memory\nare not uncommon; we recall a situation, but it is not centralized;\nwe do not know on which of the elements to place the psychic accent.\nAnalytic effort led me to an entirely unexpected solution of the\npicture. I missed my mother and began to suspect that she was locked in\nthis cupboard or chest, and therefore demanded that my brother should\nunlock it. As he obliged me, and I became convinced that she was not in\nthe chest, I began to cry; this is the moment firmly retained in the\nmemory, which was directly followed by the appearance of my mother, who\nappeased my worry and anxiety.\nBut how did the child get the idea of looking for the absent mother\nin the chest? Dreams which occurred at the same time pointed dimly to\na nurse, concerning whom other reminiscences were retained; as, for\nexample, that she conscientiously urged me to deliver to her the small\ncoins which I received as gifts, a detail which in itself may lay claim\nto the value of a concealing memory for later things. I then concluded\nto facilitate for myself this time the task of interpretation, and\nasked my now aged mother about that nurse. I found out all sorts of\nthings, among others the fact that this shrewd but dishonest person had\ncommitted extensive robberies during the confinement of my mother, and\nthat my half-brother was instrumental in bringing her to justice.\nThis information gave me the key to the scene from childhood, as\nthrough a sort of inspiration. The sudden disappearance of the nurse\nwas not a matter of indifference to me; I had just asked this brother\nwhere she was, probably because I had noticed that he had played a\npart in her disappearance, and he, evasive and witty as he is to this\nday, answered that she was \u201cboxed in.\u201d I understood this answer in\nthe childish way, but asked no more, as there was nothing else to be\ndiscovered. When my mother left me shortly thereafter I suspected that\nthe naughty brother had treated her in the same way as he did the\nnurse, and therefore pressed him to open the chest.\nI also understand now why in the translation of the visual childhood\nscene my mother\u2019s slenderness was accentuated; she must have struck\nme as being newly restored. I am two and a half years older than the\nsister born at that time, and when I was three years of age I was\nseparated from my half-brother.\nV\nMISTAKES IN SPEECH\nAlthough the ordinary material of speech of our mother-tongue seems to\nbe guarded against forgetting, its application, however, more often\nsuccumbs to another disturbance which is familiar to us as \u201cslips\nof the tongue.\u201d What we observe in normal persons as slips of the\ntongue gives the same impression as the first step of the so-called\n\u201cparaphasias\u201d which manifest themselves under pathologic conditions.\nI am in the exceptional position of being about to refer to a previous\nwork on the subject. In the year 1895 Meringer and C. Mayer published\na study on _Mistakes in Speech and Reading_, with whose view-points I\ndo not agree. One of the authors, who is the spokesman in the text,\nis a philologist actuated by a linguistic interest to examine the\nrules governing those slips. He hoped to deduce from these rules the\nexistence \u201cof a definite psychic mechanism,\u201d \u201cwhereby the sounds of a\nword, of a sentence, and even the words themselves, would be associated\nand connected with one another in a quite peculiar manner\u201d (p. 10).\nThe authors grouped the examples of speech-mistakes collected by\nthem first according to purely descriptive view-points, such as\ninterchangings (_e.g._, the Milo of Venus instead of the Venus of\nMilo), as anticipations (_e.g._, the shoes made her sorft ... the shoes\nmade her feet sore), as echoes and post positions, as contaminations\n(_e.g._, \u201cI will soon him home,\u201d instead of \u201cI will soon go home and\nI will see him\u201d), and substitutions (_e.g._, \u201che entrusted his money\nto a savings crank,\u201d instead of \u201ca savings bank\u201d).[13] Besides these\nprincipal categories there are some others of lesser importance (or\nof lesser significance for our purpose). In this grouping it makes no\ndifference whether the transposition, disfigurement, fusion, etc.,\naffects single sounds of the word or syllables, or whole words of the\nconcerned sentence.\nTo explain the various forms of mistakes in speech, Meringer assumes a\nvaried psychic value of phonetics. As soon as the innervation affects\nthe first syllable of a word, or the first word of a sentence, the\nstimulating process immediately strikes the succeeding sounds, and the\nfollowing words, and in so far as these innervations are synchronous\nthey may effect some changes in one another. The stimulus of the\npsychically more intensive sound \u201crings\u201d before or continues echoing,\nand thus disturbs the less important process of innervation. It is\nnecessary therefore to determine which are the most important sounds\nof a word. Meringer states: \u201cIf one wishes to know which sound of a\nword possesses the greatest intensity he should examine himself while\nsearching for a forgotten word, for example, a name. That which first\nreturns to consciousness invariably had the greatest intensity prior to\nthe forgetting (p. 160). Thus the most important sounds are the initial\nsound of the root-syllable and the initial sound of the word itself, as\nwell as one or another of the accentuated vowels\u201d (p. 162).\nHere I cannot help voicing a contradiction. Whether or not the initial\nsound of the name belongs to the most important elements of the word,\nit is surely not true that in the case of the forgetting of the word\nit first returns to consciousness; the above rule is therefore of no\nuse. When we observe ourselves during the search for a forgotten name\nwe are comparatively often forced to express the opinion that it begins\nwith a certain letter. This conviction proves to be as often unfounded\nas founded. Indeed, I would even go so far as to assert that in the\nmajority of cases one reproduces a false initial sound. Also in our\nexample _Signorelli_ the substitutive name lacked the initial sound,\nand the principal syllables were lost; on the other hand, the less\nimportant pair of syllables _elli_ returned to consciousness in the\nsubstitutive name _Botticelli_.\nHow little substitutive names respect the initial sound of the lost\nnames may be learned from the following case. One day I found it\nimpossible to recall the name of the small country whose capital is\nMonte Carlo. The substitutive names were as follows: _Piedmont_,\n_Albania_, _Montevideo_, _Colico_. In place of Albania _Montenegro_\nsoon appeared, and then it struck me that the syllable _Mont_\n(pronounced _Mon_) occurred in all but the last of the substitutive\nnames. It thus became easy for me to find from the name of Prince\nAlbert the forgotten name _Monaco_. _Colico_ practically imitates the\nsyllabic sequence and rhythm of the forgotten name.\nIf we admit the conjecture that a mechanism similar to that pointed\nout in the forgetting of names may also play a part in the phenomena\nof speech-blunders, we are then led to a better founded judgment of\ncases of speech-blunders. The speech disturbance which manifests\nitself as a speech-blunder may in the first place be caused by the\ninfluence of another component of the same speech, that is, through a\nfore-sound or an echo, or through another meaning within the sentence\nor context which differs from that which the speaker wishes to utter.\nIn the second place, however, the disturbance could be brought about\nanalogously to the process in the case _Signorelli_, through influences\noutside this word, sentence or context, from elements which we did not\nintend to express, and of whose incitement we became conscious only\nthrough the disturbance. In both modes of origin of the mistake in\nspeech the common element lies in the simultaneity of the stimulus,\nwhile the differentiating elements lie in the arrangement within or\nwithout the same sentence or context.\nThe difference does not at first appear as wide as when it is taken\ninto consideration in certain conclusions drawn from the symptomatology\nof speech-mistakes. It is clear, however, that only in the first case\nis there a prospect of drawing conclusions from the manifestations of\nspeech-blunders concerning a mechanism which connects together sounds\nand words for the reciprocal influence of their articulation; that is,\nconclusions such as the philologist hopes to gain from the study of\nspeech-blunders. In the case of disturbance through influence outside\nof the same sentence or context, it would before all be a question of\nbecoming acquainted with the disturbing elements, and then the question\nwould arise whether the mechanism of this disturbance cannot also\nsuggest the probable laws of the formation of speech.\nWe cannot maintain that Meringer and Mayer have overlooked the\npossibility of speech disturbance through \u201ccomplicated psychic\ninfluences,\u201d that is, through elements outside of the same word or\nsentence or the same sequence of words. Indeed, they must have observed\nthat the theory of the psychic variation of sounds applies, strictly\nspeaking, only to the explanation of sound disturbances as well as to\nfore-sounds and after-sounds. Where the word disturbances cannot be\nreduced to sound disturbances, as, for example, in the substitutions\nand contaminations of words, they, too, have without hesitation sought\nthe cause of the mistake in speech outside of the intended context,\nand proved this state of affairs by means of fitting examples.[14]\nAccording to the author\u2019s own understanding it is some similarity\nbetween a certain word in the intended sentence and some other not\nintended, which allows the latter to assert itself in consciousness\nby causing a disfigurement, a composition, or a compromise formation\n(contamination).\nNow, in my work on the _Interpretation of Dreams_ I have shown the\npart played by the process of condensation in the origin of the\nso-called manifest contents of the dream from the latent thoughts of\nthe dream. Any similarity of objects or of word-presentations between\ntwo elements of the unconscious material is taken as a cause for the\nformation of a third, which is a composite or compromise formation.\nThis element represents both components in the dream content, and\nin view of this origin it is frequently endowed with numerous\ncontradictory individual determinants. The formation of substitutions\nand contaminations in speech-mistakes is, therefore, the beginning of\nthat work of condensation which we find taking a most active part in\nthe construction of the dream.\nIn a small essay destined for the general reader,[15] Meringer\nadvanced a theory of very practical significance for certain cases of\ninterchanging of words, especially for such cases where one word is\nsubstituted by another of opposite meaning. He says: \u201cWe may still\nrecall the manner in which the President of the Austrian House of\nDeputies opened the session some time ago: \u2018Honoured Sirs! I announce\nthe presence of so and so many gentlemen, and therefore declare\nthe session as \u201cclosed\u201d\u2019!\u201d The general merriment first attracted\nhis attention and he corrected his mistake. In the present case\nthe probable explanation is that the President wished himself in a\nposition to close this session, from which he had little good to\nexpect, and the thought broke through at least partially--a frequent\nmanifestation--resulting in his use of \u201cclosed\u201d in place of \u201copened,\u201d\nthat is, the opposite of the statement intended. Numerous observations\nhave taught me, however, that we frequently interchange contrasting\nwords; they are already associated in our speech consciousness; they\nlie very close together and are easily incorrectly evoked.\nStill, not in all cases of contrast substitution is it so simple\nas in the example of the President as to appear plausible that the\nspeech-mistake occurs merely as a contradiction which arises in the\ninner thought of the speaker opposing the sentence uttered. We have\nfound the analogous mechanism in the analysis of the example _aliquis_;\nthere the inner contradiction asserts itself in the form of forgetting\na word instead of a substitution through its opposite. But in order to\nadjust the difference we may remark that the little word _aliquis_ is\nincapable of a contrast similar to \u201cclosing\u201d and \u201copening,\u201d and that\nthe word \u201copening\u201d cannot be subject to forgetting on account of its\nbeing a common component of speech.\nHaving been shown by the last examples of Meringer and Mayer that\nspeech disturbance may be caused through the influence of fore-sounds,\nafter-sounds, words from the same sentence that were intended for\nexpression, as well as through the effect of words outside the sentence\nintended, _the stimulus of which would otherwise not have been\nsuspected_, we shall next wish to discover whether we can definitely\nseparate the two classes of mistakes in speech, and how we can\ndistinguish the example of the one from a case of the other class.\nBut at this stage of the discussion we must also think of the\nassertions of Wundt, who deals with the manifestations of\nspeech-mistakes in his recent work on the development of language.[16]\nPsychic influences, according to Wundt, never lack in these as well as\nin other phenomena related to them. \u201cThe uninhibited stream of _sound_\nand _word associations_ stimulated by spoken sounds belongs here in the\nfirst place as a positive determinant. This is supported as a negative\nfactor by the relaxation or suppression of the influences of the will\nwhich inhibit this stream, and by the active attention which is here a\nfunction of volition. Whether that play of association manifests itself\nin the fact that a coming sound is anticipated or a preceding sound\nreproduced, or whether a familiar practised sound becomes intercalated\nbetween others, or finally, whether it manifests itself in the fact\nthat altogether different sounds associatively related to the spoken\nsounds act upon these--all these questions designate only differences\nin the direction, and at most in the play of the occurring associations\nbut not in the general nature of the same. In some cases it may be\nalso doubtful to which form a certain disturbance may be attributed,\nor whether it would not be more correct to refer such disturbance\nto a concurrence of many motives, _following the principle of the\ncomplication of causes_[17] (cf. pp. 380-81).\u201d\nI consider these observations of Wundt as absolutely justified and very\ninstructive. Perhaps we could emphasize with even greater firmness\nthan Wundt that the positive factor favouring mistakes in speech (the\nuninhibited stream of associations, and its negative, the relaxation of\nthe inhibiting attention) regularly attain synchronous action, so that\nboth factors become only different determinants of the same process.\nWith the relaxation, or, more unequivocally expressed, _through_ this\nrelaxation, of the inhibiting attention the uninhibited stream of\nassociations becomes active.\nAmong the examples of the mistakes in speech collected by me I can\nscarcely find one in which I would be obliged to attribute the speech\ndisturbance simply and solely to what Wundt calls \u201ccontact effect\nof sound.\u201d Almost invariably I discover besides this a disturbing\ninfluence of something outside of the intended speech. The disturbing\nelement is either a single unconscious thought, which comes to light\nthrough the speech-blunder, and can only be brought to consciousness\nthrough a searching analysis, or it is a more general psychic motive,\nwhich directs itself against the entire speech.\n(_Example_ _a_) Seeing my daughter make an unpleasant face while biting\ninto an apple, I wished to quote the following couplet:--\n\u201cThe ape he is a funny sight,\nWhen in the apple he takes a bite.\u201d\nBut I began: \u201cThe apel....\u201d This seems to be a contamination of \u201cape\u201d\nand \u201capple\u201d (compromise formation), or it may be also conceived as\nan anticipation of the prepared \u201capple.\u201d The true state of affairs,\nhowever, was this: I began the quotation once before, and made no\nmistake the first time. I made the mistake only during the repetition,\nwhich was necessary because my daughter, having been distracted from\nanother side, did not listen to me. This repetition with the added\nimpatience to disburden myself of the sentence I must include in\nthe motivation of the speech-blunder, which represented itself as a\nfunction of condensation.\n(_b_) My daughter said, \u201cI wrote to Mrs. Schresinger.\u201d The woman\u2019s name\nwas Schlesinger. This speech-blunder may depend on the tendency to\nfacilitate articulation. I must state, however, that this mistake was\nmade by my daughter a few moments after I had said _apel_ instead of\n_ape_. Mistakes in speech are in a great measure contagious; a similar\npeculiarity was noticed by Meringer and Mayer in the forgetting of\nnames. I know of no reason for this psychic contagiousness.\n(_c_) \u201cI _sut_ up like a pocket-knife,\u201d said a patient in the beginning\nof treatment, instead of \u201cI _shut_ up.\u201d This suggests a difficulty\nof articulation which may serve as an excuse for the interchanging\nof sounds. When her attention was called to the speech-blunder, she\npromptly replied, \u201cYes, that happened because you said \u2018_earnesht_\u2019\ninstead of \u2018_earnest_.\u2019\u201d As a matter of fact I received her with the\nremark, \u201cTo-day we shall be in earnest\u201d (because it was the last hour\nbefore her discharge from treatment), and I jokingly changed the word\ninto _earnesht_. In the course of the hour she repeatedly made mistakes\nin speech, and I finally observed that it was not only because she\nimitated me but because she had a special reason in her unconscious to\nlinger at the word earnest (Ernst) as a name.[18]\n(_d_) A woman, speaking about a game invented by her children and\ncalled by them \u201cthe man in the box,\u201d said \u201cthe manx in the boc.\u201d\nI could readily understand her mistake. It was while analysing\nher dream, in which her husband is depicted as very generous in\nmoney matters--just the reverse of reality--that she made this\nspeech-blunder. The day before she had asked for a new set of furs,\nwhich her husband denied her, claiming that he could not afford to\nspend so much money. She upbraided him for his stinginess, \u201cfor putting\naway so much into the strong-box,\u201d and mentioned a friend whose husband\nhas not nearly his income, and yet he presented his wife with a _mink_\ncoat for her birthday. The mistake is now comprehensible. The word\n_manx_ (_manks_) reduces itself to the \u201cminks\u201d which she longs for, and\nthe _box_ refers to her husband\u2019s stinginess.\n(_e_) A similar mechanism is shown in the mistake of another patient\nwhose memory deserted her in the midst of a long-forgotten childish\nreminiscence. Her memory failed to inform her on what part of the body\nthe prying and lustful hand of another had touched her. Soon thereafter\nshe visited one of her friends, with whom she discussed summer homes.\nAsked where her cottage in M. was located, she answered, \u201cNear the\n_mountain loin_\u201d instead of \u201c_mountain lane_.\u201d\n(_f_) Another patient, whom I asked at the end of her visit how her\nuncle was, answered: \u201cI don\u2019t know, I only see him now _in flagranti_.\u201d\nThe following day she said, \u201cI am really ashamed of myself for having\ngiven you yesterday such a stupid answer. Naturally you must have\nthought me a very uneducated person who always mistakes the meaning\nof foreign words. I wished to say _en passant_.\u201d We did not know at\nthe time where she got the incorrectly used foreign words, but during\nthe same session she reproduced a reminiscence as a continuation of\nthe theme from the previous day, in which being caught _in flagranti_\nplayed the principal part. The mistake of the previous day had\ntherefore anticipated the recollection, which at that time had not yet\nbecome conscious.\n(_g_) In discussing her summer plans, a patient said, \u201cI shall remain\nmost of the summer in _Elberlon_.\u201d She noted her mistake, and asked me\nto analyse it. The associations to _Elberlon_ elicited: seashore on\nthe Jersey coast--summer resort--vacation travelling. This recalled\ntravelling in Europe with her cousin, a topic which we had discussed\nthe day before during the analysis of a dream. The dream dealt with\nher dislike for this cousin, and she admitted that it was mainly due\nto the fact that the latter was the favourite of the man whom they met\ntogether while travelling abroad. During the dream analysis she could\nnot recall the name of the city in which they met this man, and I did\nnot make any effort at the time to bring it to her consciousness, as we\nwere engrossed in a totally different problem. When asked to focus her\nattention again on Elberlon and reproduce her associations, she said,\n\u201cIt brings to mind _Elberlawn_--_lawn_--_field_--and _Elberfield_.\u201d\n_Elberfeld_ was the lost name of the city in Germany. Here the mistake\nserved to bring to consciousness in a concealed manner a memory which\nwas connected with a painful feeling.\n(_h_) A woman said to me, \u201cIf you wish to buy a carpet, go to\n_Merchant_ (Kaufmann) in _Matthew Street_ (Math\u00e4usgasse).\u201d I repeated,\n\u201cThen at Matthew\u2019s--I mean at Merchant\u2019s----\u201d It would seem that my\nrepeating of one name in place of the other was simply the result of\ndistraction. The woman\u2019s remark really did distract me, as she turned\nmy attention to something else much more vital to me than carpet. In\nMatthew Street stands the house in which my wife lived as a bride.\nThe entrance to the house was in another street, and now I noticed\nthat I had forgotten its name and could only recall it through a\nroundabout method. The name Matthew, which kept my attention, is thus\na substitutive name for the forgotten name of the street. It is more\nsuitable than the name Merchant, for Matthew is exclusively the name of\na person, while Merchant is not. The forgotten street, too, bears the\nname of a person: _Radetzky_.\n(_i_) A patient consulted me for the first time, and from her history\nit became apparent that the cause of her nervousness was largely an\nunhappy married life. Without any encouragement she went into details\nabout her marital troubles. She had not lived with her husband for\nabout six months, and she saw him last at the theatre, when she saw\nthe play _Officer 606_. I called her attention to the mistake, and she\nimmediately corrected herself, saying that she meant to say _Officer\n666_ (the name of a recent popular play). I decided to find out the\nreason for the mistake, and as the patient came to me for analytic\ntreatment, I discovered that the immediate cause of the rupture between\nherself and husband was the disease which is treated by \u201c606.\u201d[19]\n(_k_) Before calling on me a patient telephoned for an appointment,\nand also wished to be informed about my consultation fee. He was told\nthat the first consultation was ten dollars; after the examination was\nover he again asked what he was to pay, and added: \u201cI don\u2019t like to owe\nmoney to any one, especially to doctors; I prefer to pay right away.\u201d\nInstead of _pay_ he said _play_. His last voluntary remarks and his\nmistake put me on my guard, but after a few more uncalled-for remarks\nhe set me at ease by taking money from his pocket. He counted four\npaper dollars and was very chagrined and surprised because he had no\nmore money with him, and promised to send me a cheque for the balance.\nI was sure that his mistake betrayed him, that he was only _playing_\nwith me, but there was nothing to be done. At the end of a few weeks I\nsent him a bill for the balance, and the letter was returned to me by\nthe post-office authorities marked \u201cNot found.\u201d\n(_l_) Miss X. spoke very warmly of Mr. Y., which was rather strange, as\nbefore this she had always expressed her indifference, not to say her\ncontempt, for him. On being asked about this sudden change of heart she\nsaid: \u201cI really never had anything against him; he was always nice to\nme, but I never gave him the chance to cultivate my acquaintance.\u201d She\nsaid \u201ccuptivate.\u201d This neologism was a contamination of _cultivate_ and\n_captivate_, and foretold the coming betrothal.\n(_m_) An illustration of the mechanisms of contamination and\ncondensation will be found in the following _lapsus lingu\u00e6_. Speaking\nof Miss Z., Miss W. depicted her as a very \u201cstraitlaced\u201d person who\nwas not given to levities, etc. Miss X. thereupon remarked: \u201cYes,\nthat is a very characteristic description, she always appealed to me\nas very \u2018_straicet-brazed_.\u2019\u201d Here the mistake resolved itself into\n_straitlaced_ and _brazen-faced_, which corresponded to Miss W.\u2019s\nopinion of Miss Z.\n(_n_) I shall quote a number of examples from a paper by my colleague,\nDr. W. Stekel, which appeared in the Berlin _Tageblatt_ of January,\n1904, entitled \u201cUnconscious Confessions.\u201d\n\u201cAn unpleasant trick of my unpleasant thoughts was revealed by the\nfollowing example: To begin with, I may state that in my capacity\nas a physician I never consider my remuneration, but always keep in\nview the patient\u2019s interest only: this goes without saying. I was\nvisiting a patient who was convalescing from a serious illness. We\nhad passed through hard days and nights. I was happy to find her\nimproved, and I portrayed to her the pleasures of a sojourn in Abbazia,\nconcluding with: \u2018If, as I hope, you will _not_ soon leave your bed.\u2019\nThis obviously came from an unconscious selfish motive, to be able\nto continue treating this wealthy patient, a wish which is entirely\nforeign to my waking consciousness, and which I would reject with\nindignation.\u201d\n(_o_) Another example (Dr. W. Stekel): \u201cMy wife engaged a French\ngoverness for the afternoons, and later, coming to a satisfactory\nagreement, wished to retain her testimonials. The governess begged\nto be allowed to keep them, saying, \u2018Je cherche encore pour les\n_apr\u00e8s-midis_--pardons, pour les _avant-midis_.\u2019 She apparently\nintended to seek another place which would perhaps offer more\nprofitable arrangements--an intention which she carried out.\u201d\n(_p_) I was to give a lecture to a woman. Her husband, upon whose\nrequest this was done, stood behind the door listening. At the end of\nmy sermonizing, which had made a visible impression, I said: \u201cGood-bye,\nsir!\u201d To the experienced person I thus betrayed the fact that the words\nwere directed towards the husband; that I had spoken to oblige him.\n(_q_) Dr. Stekel reports about himself that he had under treatment\nat the same time two patients from Triest, each of whom he always\naddressed incorrectly. \u201cGood morning, Mr. Peloni!\u201d he would say to\nAskoli, and to Peloni, \u201cGood morning, Mr. Askoli!\u201d He was at first\ninclined to attribute no deeper motive to this mistake, but to explain\nit through a number of similarities in both persons. However, he easily\nconvinced himself that here the interchange of names bespoke a sort\nof boast--that is, he was acquainting each of his Italian patients\nwith the fact that neither was the only resident of Triest who came to\nVienna in search of his medical advice.\n(_r_) Two women stopped in front of a drug-store, and one said to her\ncompanion, \u201cIf you will wait a few _moments_ I\u2019ll soon be back,\u201d but\nshe said _movements_ instead. She was on her way to buy some castoria\nfor her child.\n(_s_) Mr. L., who is fonder of being called on than of calling, spoke\nto me through the telephone from a nearby summer resort. He wanted\nto know when I would pay him a visit. I reminded him that it was his\nturn to visit me, and called his attention to the fact that, as he was\nthe happy possessor of an automobile, it would be easier for him to\ncall on me. (We were at different summer resorts, separated by about\none half-hour\u2019s railway trip.) He gladly promised to call, and asked:\n\u201cHow about Labour Day (September 1st), will it be convenient for you?\u201d\nWhen I answered affirmatively, he said, \u201cVery well, then, put me down\nfor _Election_ Day\u201d (November). His mistake was quite plain. He likes\nto visit me, but it was inconvenient to travel so far. In November we\nwould both be in the city. My analysis proved correct.\n(_t_) A friend described to me a nervous patient, and wished to know\nwhether I could benefit him. I remarked: \u201cI believe that in time I can\nremove all his symptoms by psychoanalysis, because it is a durable\ncase,\u201d wishing to say \u201ccurable\u201d!\n(_u_) I repeatedly addressed my patient as Mrs. Smith, her married\ndaughter\u2019s name, when her real name is Mrs. James. My attention having\nbeen called to it, I soon discovered that I had another patient of the\nsame name who refused to pay for the treatment. Mrs. Smith was also my\npatient and paid her bills promptly.\n(_v_) A _lapsus lingu\u00e6_ sometimes stands for a particular\ncharacteristic. A young woman, who is the domineering spirit in her\nhome, said of her ailing husband that he had consulted the doctor about\na wholesome diet for himself, and then added: \u201cThe doctor said that\ndiet has nothing to do with his ailments, and that he can eat and drink\nwhat _I_ want.\u201d\n(_w_) I cannot omit this excellent and instructive example, although,\naccording to my authority, it is about twenty years old. A lady once\nexpressed herself in society--the very words show that they were\nuttered with fervour and under the pressure of a great many secret\nemotions: \u201cYes, a woman must be pretty if she is to please the men. A\nman is much better off. As long as he has _five_ straight limbs, he\nneeds no more!\u201d\nThis example affords us a good insight into the intimate mechanisms of\na mistake in speech by means of condensation and contamination (cf.\np. 72). It is quite obvious that we have here a fusion of two similar\nmodes of expression:--\n\u201cAs long as he has his four _straight limbs_.\u201d\n\u201cAs long as he has all his _five senses_.\u201d\nOr the term \u201cstraight\u201d may be the common element of the two intended\nexpressions:--\n\u201cAs long as he has his _straight_ limbs.\u201d\n\u201cAll five should be _straight_.\u201d\nIt may also be assumed that both modes of expression--viz., those of\nthe five senses and those of the straight five--have co-operated to\nintroduce into the sentence about the straight limbs first a number and\nthen the mysterious five instead of the simple four. But this fusion\nsurely would not have succeeded if it had not expressed good sense in\nthe form resulting from the mistake; if it had not expressed a cynical\ntruth which, naturally, could not be uttered unconcealed, coming as it\ndid from a woman.\nFinally, we shall not hesitate to call attention to the fact that\nthe woman\u2019s saying, following its wording, could just as well be\nan excellent witticism as a jocose speech-blunder. It is simply a\nquestion whether she uttered these words with conscious or unconscious\nintention. The behaviour of the speaker in this case certainly speaks\nagainst the conscious intention, and thus excludes wit.\n(_x_) Owing to similarity of material, I add here another case of\nspeech-blunder, the interpretation of which requires less skill. A\nprofessor of anatomy strove to explain the nostril, which, as is known,\nis a very difficult anatomical structure. To his question whether\nhis audience grasped his ideas he received an affirmative reply. The\nprofessor, known for his self-esteem, thereupon remarked: \u201cI can\nhardly believe this, for the number of people who understand the\nnostril, even in a city of millions like Vienna, can be counted _on a\nfinger_--pardon me, I meant to say _on the fingers_ of a hand.\u201d\n(_y_) I am indebted to Dr. Alf. Robitsek, of Vienna, for calling my\nattention to two speech-blunders from an old French author, which I\nshall reproduce in the original.\nBrant\u00f4me (1527-1614), _Vies des Dames galantes_, Discours second: \u201cSi\nay-je cogneu une tr\u00e8s belle et honneste dame de par le monde, qui,\ndevisant avec un honneste gentilhomme de la cour des affaires de la\nguerre durant ces civiles, elle luy dit: \u2018J\u2019ay ouy dire que le roy a\nfaiet rompre tous les c---- de ce pays l\u00e0.\u2019 Elle vouloit dire le ponts.\nPensez que, venant de coucher d\u2019avec son mary, ou songeant \u00e0 son amant,\nelle avoit encor ce nom frais en la bouche; et le gentilhomme s\u2019en\neschauffer en amours d\u2019elle pour ce mot.\n\u201cUne autre dame que j\u2019ai cogneue, entretenant une autre grand dame\nplus qu\u2019elle, et luy louant et exaltant ses beautez, elle luy dit\napr\u00e8s: \u2018Non, madame, ce que je vous en dis, ce n\u2019est point pour vous\n_adult\u00e9rer_\u2019; voulant dire _adulater_, comme elle le rhabilla ainsi:\npensez qu\u2019elle songeoit \u00e0 adult\u00e9rer.\u201d\nIn the psychotherapeutic procedure which I employ in the solution and\nremoval of neurotic symptoms, I am often confronted with the task\nof discovering from the accidental utterances and fancies of the\npatient the thought contents, which, though striving for concealment,\nnevertheless unintentionally betray themselves. In doing this the\nmistakes often perform the most valuable service, as I can show through\nmost convincing and still most singular examples.\nFor example, patients speak of an aunt and later, without noting the\nmistake, call her \u201cmy mother,\u201d or designate a husband as a \u201cbrother.\u201d\nIn this way they attract my attention to the fact that they have\n\u201cidentified\u201d these persons with each other, that they have placed them\nin the same category, which for their emotional life signifies the\nrecurrence of the same type. Or, a young man of twenty years presents\nhimself during my office hours with these words: \u201cI am the father of\nN. N., whom you have treated--pardon me, I mean the brother; why, he\nis four years older than I.\u201d I understand through this mistake that\nhe wishes to express that, like the brother, he, too, is ill through\nthe fault of the father; like his brother, he wishes to be cured, but\nthat the father is the one most in need of treatment. At other times an\nunusual arrangement of words, or a forced expression, is sufficient to\ndisclose in the speech of the patient the participation of a repressed\nthought having a different motive.\nHence, in coarse as well as in finer speech disturbances, which may,\nnevertheless, be subsumed as \u201cspeech-blunders,\u201d I find that it is\nnot the contact effects of the sound, but the thoughts outside the\nintended speech, which determine the origin of the speech-blunder, and\nalso suffice to explain the newly formed mistakes in speech. I do not\ndoubt the laws whereby the sounds produce changes upon one another;\nbut they alone do not appear to me sufficiently forcible to mar the\ncorrect execution of speech. In those cases which I have studied\nand investigated more closely they merely represent the preformed\nmechanism, which is conveniently utilized by a more remote psychic\nmotive. The latter does not, however, form a part of the sphere of\ninfluence of these sound relations. _In a large number of substitutions\ncaused by mistakes in talking there is an entire absence of such\nphonetic laws._ In this respect I am in full accord with Wundt, who\nlikewise assumes that the conditions underlying speech-blunders are\ncomplex and go far beyond the contact effect of the sounds.\nIf I accept as certain \u201cthese more remote psychic influences,\u201d\nfollowing Wundt\u2019s expression, there is still nothing to detain me from\nconceding also that in accelerated speech, with a certain amount of\ndiverted attention, the causes of speech-blunder may be easily limited\nto the definite law of Meringer and Mayer. However, in a number of\nexamples gathered by these authors a more complicated solution is\nquite apparent.\nIn some forms of speech-blunders we may assume that the disturbing\nfactor is the result of striking against obscene words and meanings.\nThe purposive disfigurement and distortion of words and phrases,\nwhich is so popular with vulgar persons, aims at nothing else but the\nemploying of a harmless motive as a reminder of the obscene, and this\nsport is so frequent that it would not be at all remarkable if it\nappeared unintentionally and contrary to the will.\nI trust that the readers will not depreciate the value of these\ninterpretations, for which there is no proof, and of these examples\nwhich I have myself collected and explained by means of analysis. But\nif secretly I still cherish the expectation that even the apparently\nsimple cases of speech-blunder will be traced to a disturbance caused\nby a half-repressed idea outside of the intended context, I am tempted\nto it by a noteworthy observation of Meringer. This author asserts that\nit is remarkable that nobody wishes to admit having made a mistake in\nspeaking. There are many intelligent and honest people who are offended\nif we tell them that they made a mistake in speaking. I would not risk\nmaking this assertion as general as does Meringer, using the term\n\u201cnobody.\u201d But the emotional trace which clings to the demonstration\nof the mistake, which manifestly belongs to the nature of shame, has\nits significance. It may be classed with the anger displayed at the\ninability to recall a forgotten name, and with the surprise at the\ntenaciousness of an apparently indifferent memory, and it invariably\npoints to the participation of a motive in the formation of the\ndisturbance.\nThe distorting of names amounts to an insult when done intentionally,\nand could have the same significance in a whole series of cases\nwhere it appears as unintentional speech-blunders. The person who,\naccording to Mayer\u2019s report, once said \u201cFreuder\u201d instead of \u201cFreud,\u201d\nbecause shortly before he pronounced the name \u201cBreuer\u201d (p. 38), and\nwho at another time spoke of the \u201cFreuer-Breudian\u201d method (p. 28), was\ncertainly not particularly enthusiastic over this method. Later, under\nthe mistakes in writing, I shall report a case of name disfigurement\nwhich certainly admits of no other explanation.[20]\nAs a disturbing element in these cases there is an intermingling of a\ncriticism which must be omitted, because at the time being it does not\ncorrespond to the intention of the speaker.\nOr it may be just the reverse; the substituted name, or the adoption\nof the strange name, signifies an appreciation of the same. The\nidentification which is brought about by the mistake is equivalent\nto a recognition which for the moment must remain in the background.\nAn experience of this kind from his schooldays is related by Dr.\nFerenczi:--\n\u201cWhile in my first year at college I was obliged to recite a poem\nbefore the whole class. It was the first experience of the kind in my\nlife, but I was well prepared. As soon as I began my recitation I was\ndismayed at being disturbed by an outburst of laughter. The professor\nlater explained to me this strange reception. I started by giving the\ntitle \u2018From the Distance,\u2019 which was correct, but instead of giving the\nname of the real author, I mentioned--my own. The name of the poet is\nAlexander Pet\u00f6fi. The identity of the first name with my own favoured\nthe interchange of names, but the real reason was surely the fact that\nI identified myself at that time with the celebrated poet-hero. Even\nconsciously I entertained for him a love and respect which verged on\nadoration. The whole ambition-complex hides itself under this faulty\naction.\u201d\nA similar identification was reported to me concerning a young\nphysician who timidly and reverently introduced himself to the\ncelebrated Virchow with the following words: \u201cI am Dr. Virchow.\u201d\nThe surprised professor turned to him and asked, \u201cIs your name also\nVirchow?\u201d I do not know how the ambitious young man justified his\nspeech-blunder, whether he thought of the charming excuse that he\nimagined himself so insignificant next to this big man that his own\nname slipped from him, or whether he had the courage to admit that he\nhoped that he, too, would some day be as great a man as Virchow, and\nthat the professor should therefore not treat him in too disparaging a\nmanner. One or both of these thoughts may have put this young man in an\nembarrassing position during the introduction.\nOwing to very personal motives I must leave it undecided whether a\nsimilar interpretation may also apply in the case to be cited. At the\nInternational Congress in Amsterdam, in 1907, my theories of hysteria\nwere the subject of a lively discussion. One of my most violent\nopponents, in his diatribe against me, repeatedly made mistakes in\nspeech in such a manner that he put himself in my place and spoke in\nmy name. He said, for example, \u201cBreuer and I, as is well known, have\ndemonstrated,\u201d etc., when he wished to say \u201cBreuer and Freud.\u201d The name\nof this opponent does not show the slightest sound similarity to my\nown. From this example, as well as from other cases of interchanging\nnames in speech-blunders, we are reminded of the fact that the\nspeech-blunder can fully forego the facility afforded to it through\nsimilar sounds, and can achieve its purpose if only supported in\ncontent by concealed relations.\nIn other and more significant cases it is a self-criticism, an\ninternal contradiction against one\u2019s own utterance, which causes the\nspeech-blunder, and even forces a contrasting substitution for the one\nintended. We then observe with surprise how the wording of an assertion\nremoves the purpose of the same, and how the error in speech lays bare\nthe inner dishonesty. Here the _lapsus lingu\u00e6_ becomes a mimicking form\nof expression, often, indeed, for the expression of what one does not\nwish to say. It is thus a means of self-betrayal.\nBrill relates: \u201cI had recently been consulted by a woman who showed\nmany paranoid trends, and as she had no relatives who could co-operate\nwith me, I urged her to enter a State hospital as a voluntary patient.\nShe was quite willing to do so, but on the following day she told\nme that her friends with whom she leased an apartment objected to\nher going to a hospital, as it would interfere with their plans,\nand so on. I lost patience and said: \u2018There is no use listening to\nyour friends who know nothing about your mental condition; you are\nquite _incompetent_ to take care of your own affairs.\u2019 I meant to say\n\u2018competent.\u2019 Here the _lapsus lingu\u00e6_ expressed my true opinion.\u201d\nFavoured by chance the speech material often gives origin to examples\nof speech-blunders which serve to bring about an overwhelming\nrevelation or a full comic effect, as shown by the following examples\nreported by Brill:--\n\u201cA wealthy but not very generous host invited his friends for an\nevening dance. Everything went well until about 11.30 p.m., when there\nwas an intermission, presumably for supper. To the great disappointment\nof most of the guests there was no supper; instead, they were regaled\nwith thin sandwiches and lemonade. As it was close to Election day the\nconversation centred on the different candidates; and as the discussion\ngrew warmer, one of the guests, an ardent admirer of the Progressive\nParty candidate, remarked to the host: \u2018You may say what you please\nabout Teddy, but there is one thing--he can always be relied upon;\nhe always gives you a _square meal_,\u2019 wishing to say _square deal_.\nThe assembled guests burst into a roar of laughter, to the great\nembarrassment of the speaker and the host, who fully understood each\nother.\u201d\n\u201cWhile writing a prescription for a woman who was especially weighed\ndown by the financial burden of the treatment, I was interested to hear\nher say suddenly: \u2018Please do not give me _big bills_, because I cannot\nswallow them.\u2019 Of course she meant to say _pills_.\u201d\nThe following example illustrates a rather serious case of\nself-betrayal through a mistake in talking. Some accessory details\njustify full reproduction as first printed by Dr. A. A. Brill.[21]\n\u201cWhile walking one night with Dr. Frink we accidentally met a\ncolleague, Dr. P., whom I had not seen for years, and of whose private\nlife I knew nothing. We were naturally very pleased to meet again, and\non my invitation he accompanied us to a caf\u00e9, where we spent about two\nhours in pleasant conversation. To my question as to whether he was\nmarried he gave a negative answer, and added, \u2018Why should a man like me\nmarry?\u2019\n\u201cOn leaving the caf\u00e9, he suddenly turned to me and said: \u2018I should\nlike to know what you would do in a case like this: I know a nurse\nwho was named as co-respondent in a divorce case. The wife sued the\nhusband for divorce and named her as co-respondent, and _he_ got the\ndivorce.\u2019 I interrupted him, saying, \u2018You mean _she_ got the divorce.\u2019\nHe immediately corrected himself, saying, \u2018Yes, she got the divorce,\u2019\nand continued to tell how the excitement of the trial had affected this\nnurse to such an extent that she became nervous and took to drink. He\nwanted me to advise him how to treat her.\n\u201cAs soon as I had corrected his mistake I asked him to explain it, but,\nas is usually the case, he was surprised at my question. He wanted\nto know whether a person had no right to make mistakes in talking. I\nexplained to him that there is a reason for every mistake, and that if\nhe had not told me that he was unmarried, I would say that he was the\nhero of the divorce case in question, and that the mistake showed that\nhe wished he had obtained the divorce instead of his wife, so as not\nto be obliged to pay alimony and to be permitted to marry again in New\nYork State.\n\u201cHe stoutly denied my interpretation, but his emotional agitation,\nfollowed by loud laughter, only strengthened my suspicions. To my\nappeal that he should tell the truth \u2018for science\u2019 sake,\u2019 he said,\n\u2018Unless you wish me to lie you must believe that I was never married,\nand hence your psychoanalytic interpretation is all wrong.\u2019 He,\nhowever, added that it was dangerous to be with a person who paid\nattention to such little things. Then he suddenly remembered that he\nhad another appointment and left us.\n\u201cBoth Dr. Frink and I were convinced that my interpretation of his\n_lapsus lingu\u00e6_ was correct, and I decided to corroborate or disprove\nit by further investigation. The next day I found a neighbour and old\nfriend of Dr. P., who confirmed my interpretation in every particular.\nThe divorce was granted to Dr. P.\u2019s wife a few weeks before, and a\nnurse was named as co-respondent. A few weeks later I met Dr. P., and\nhe told me that he was thoroughly convinced of the Freudian mechanisms.\u201d\nThe self-betrayal is just as plain in the following case reported by\nOtto Rank:--\nA father who was devoid of all patriotic feeling and desirous of\neducating his children to be just as free from this superfluous\nsentiment, reproached his sons for participating in a patriotic\ndemonstration, and rejected their reference to a similar behaviour of\ntheir uncle with these words: \u201cYou are not obliged to imitate him;\nwhy, he is an _idiot_.\u201d The astonished features of the children at\ntheir father\u2019s unusual tone aroused him to the fact that he had made a\nmistake, and he remarked apologetically, \u201cOf course, I wished to say\n_patriot_.\u201d\nWhen such a speech-blunder occurs in a serious squabble and reverses\nthe intended meaning of one of the disputants, at once it puts him at a\ndisadvantage with his adversary--a disadvantage which the latter seldom\nfails to utilize.\nThis clearly shows that although people are unwilling to accept\nthe theory of my conception and are not inclined to forego the\nconvenience that is connected with the tolerance of a faulty action,\nthey nevertheless interpret speech-blunders and other faulty acts in\na manner similar to the one presented in this book. The merriment and\nderision which are sure to be evoked at the decisive moment through\nsuch linguistic mistakes speak conclusively against the generally\naccepted convention that such a speech-blunder is a _lapsus lingu\u00e6_\nand psychologically of no importance. It was no less a man than the\nGerman Chancellor, Prince B\u00fclow, who endeavoured to save the situation\nthrough such a protest when the wording of his defence of his Emperor\n(November, 1907) turned into the opposite through a speech-blunder.\n\u201cConcerning the present, the new epoch of Emperor Wilhelm II, I can\nonly repeat what I said a year ago, that _it would be unfair and unjust\nto speak of a coterie of responsible advisers around our Emperor_ (loud\ncalls, \u2018Irresponsible!\u2019)--to speak of _irresponsible_ advisers. Pardon\nthe _lapsus lingu\u00e6_\u201d (hilarity).\nA nice example of speech-blunder, which aims not so much at the\nbetrayal of the speaker as at the enlightenment of the listener outside\nthe scene, is found in Wallenstein (_Piccolomini_, Act I, Scene 5),\nand shows us that the poet who here uses this means is well versed in\nthe mechanism and intent of speech-blunders. In the preceding scene\nMax Piccolomini was passionately in favour of the ducal party, and was\nenthusiastic over the blessings of the peace which became known to him\nin the course of a journey while accompanying Wallenstein\u2019s daughter\nto the encampment. He leaves his father and the Court ambassador,\nQuestenberg, in great consternation. The scene proceeds as follows:--\nQUESTENBERG. Woe unto us! Are matters thus? Friend, should we allow\nhim to go there with this false opinion, and not recall him at once in\norder to open his eyes instantly.\nOCTAVIO (_rousing himself from profound meditation_). He has already\nopened mine, and I see more than pleases me.\nQUESTENBERG. What is it, friend?\nOCTAVIO. A curse on that journey!\nQUESTENBERG. Why? What is it?\nOCTAVIO. Come! I must immediately follow the unlucky trail, must see\nwith my own eyes--come----(_Wishes to lead him away._)\nQUESTENBERG. What is the matter? Where?\nOCTAVIO (_urging_). To _her_!\nQUESTENBERG. To----?\nOCTAVIO (_corrects himself_). To the duke! Let us go, etc.\nThe slight speech-blunder _to her_ in place of _to him_ is meant to\nbetray to us the fact that the father has seen through his son\u2019s motive\nfor espousing the other cause, while the courtier complains that \u201che\nspeaks to him altogether in riddles.\u201d\nAnother example wherein a poet makes use of a speech-blunder was\ndiscovered by Otto Rank in Shakespeare. I quote Rank\u2019s report from the\n_Zentralblatt f\u00fcr Psychoanalyse_, I. 3.\n\u201cA poetic speech-blunder, very delicately motivated and technically\nremarkably well utilized, which, like the one pointed out by Freud in\nWallenstein (_Zur Psychopathologie des Alltagslebens_, 2nd Edition, p.\n48), not only shows that poets knew the mechanism and sense of this\nerror, but also presupposes an understanding of it on the part of the\nhearer, can be found in Shakespeare\u2019s _Merchant of Venice_ (Act III,\nScene 2). By the will of her father, Portia was bound to select a\nhusband through a lottery. She escaped all her distasteful suitors by\nlucky chance. When she finally found in Bassanio the suitor after her\nown heart, she had cause to fear lest he, too, should draw the unlucky\nlottery. In the scene she would like to tell him that even if he chose\nthe wrong casket, he might, nevertheless, be sure of her love. But she\nis hampered by her vow. In this mental conflict the poet puts these\nwords in her mouth, which were directed to the welcome suitor:--\n\u201cThere is something tells me (but it is not love),\nI would not lose you; and you know yourself\nHate counsels not in such a quality.\nBut lest you should not understand me well\n(And yet a maiden hath no tongue but thought),\nI would detain you here some month or two,\nBefore you venture for me. I could teach you\nHow to choose right, but then I am forsworn;\nSo will I never be; so may you miss me;\nBut if you do, you\u2019ll make me wish a sin,\nThat I had been forsworn. Beshrew your eyes,\nThey have o\u2019erlooked me, and divided me:\n_One half of me is yours, the other half yours_--\n_Mine own, I would say_; but if mine, then yours--\nAnd so all yours.\u201d\n\u201cJust the very thing which she would like to hint to him gently,\nbecause really she should keep it from him, namely, that even before\nthe choice she is wholly his--that she loves him, the poet, with\nadmirable psychologic sensitiveness, allows to come to the surface in\nthe speech-blunder. It is through this artifice that he manages to\nallay the intolerable uncertainty of the lover as well as the like\ntension of the hearer concerning the outcome of the choice.\u201d\nThe interest merited by the confirmation of our conception of\nspeech-blunders through the great poets justifies the citation of a\nthird example which was reported by Dr. E. Jones.[22]\n\u201cOur great novelist, George Meredith, in his masterpiece, _The Egoist_,\nshows an even finer understanding of the mechanism. The plot of the\nnovel is, shortly, as follows: Sir Willoughby Patterne, an aristocrat\ngreatly admired by his circle, becomes engaged to a Miss Constantia\nDurham. She discovers in him an intense egoism, which he skilfully\nconceals from the world, and to escape the marriage she elopes with a\nCaptain Oxford. Some years later Patterne becomes engaged to a Miss\nClara Middleton, and most of the book is taken up with a detailed\ndescription of the conflict that arises in her mind on also discovering\nhis egoism. External circumstances and her conception of honour hold\nher to her pledge, while he becomes more and more distasteful in her\neyes. She partly confided in his cousin and secretary, Vernon Whitford,\nthe man whom she ultimately marries, but from a mixture of motives he\nstands aloof.\n\u201cIn the soliloquy Clara speaks as follows: \u2018If some noble gentleman\ncould see me as I am and not disdain to aid me! Oh! to be caught out of\nthis prison of thorns and brambles. I cannot tear my own way out. I am\na coward. A beckoning of a finger would change me, I believe. I could\nfly bleeding and through hootings to a comrade.... Constantia met a\nsoldier. Perhaps she prayed and her prayer was answered. She did ill.\nBut, oh, how I love her for it! His name was Harry Oxford.... She did\nnot waver, she cut the links, she signed herself over. Oh, brave girl,\nwhat do you think of me? But I have no Harry Whitford; I am alone....\u2019\nThe sudden consciousness that she had put another name for Oxford\nstruck her a buffet, drowning her in crimson.\n\u201cThe fact that both men\u2019s names end in \u2018ford\u2019 evidently renders the\nconfounding of them more easy, and would by many be regarded as an\nadequate cause for this, but the real underlying motive for it is\nplainly indicated by the author. In another passage the same _lapsus_\noccurs, and is followed by the hesitation and change of subject that\none is familiar with in psychoanalysis when a half-conscious complex\nis touched. Sir Willoughby patronizingly says of Whitford: \u2018False\nalarm. The resolution to do anything unaccustomed is quite beyond\npoor old Vernon.\u2019 Clara replies: \u2018But if Mr. Oxford--Whitford ...\nyour swans, coming sailing up the lake; how beautiful they look when\nthey are indignant! I was going to ask you, surely men witnessing a\nmarked admiration for some one else will naturally be discouraged?\u2019 Sir\nWilloughby stiffened with sudden enlightenment.\n\u201cIn still another passage Clara, by another _lapsus_, betrays her\nsecret wish that she was on a more intimate footing with Vernon\nWhitford. Speaking to a boy friend, she says, \u2018Tell Mr. Vernon--tell\nMr. Whitford.\u2019\u201d\nThe conception of speech-blunders here defended can be readily verified\nin the smallest details. I have been able to demonstrate repeatedly\nthat the most insignificant and most natural cases of speech-blunders\nhave their good sense, and admit of the same interpretation as the\nmore striking examples. A patient who, contrary to my wishes but\nwith firm personal motives, decided upon a short trip to Budapest,\njustified herself by saying that she was going for only three days, but\nshe blundered and said for only three weeks. She betrayed her secret\nfeeling that, to spite me, she preferred spending three weeks to three\ndays in that society which I considered unfit for her.\nOne evening, wishing to excuse myself for not having called for my wife\nat the theatre, I said: \u201cI was at the theatre at ten minutes after\nten.\u201d I was corrected: \u201cYou meant to say before ten o\u2019clock.\u201d Naturally\nI wanted to say before ten. After ten would certainly be no excuse. I\nhad been told that the theatre programme read, \u201cFinished before ten\no\u2019clock.\u201d When I arrived at the theatre I found the foyer dark and\nthe theatre empty. Evidently the performance was over earlier and my\nwife did not wait for me. When I looked at the clock it still wanted\nfive minutes to ten. I determined to make my case more favourable\nat home, and say that it was ten minutes to ten. Unfortunately, the\nspeech-blunder spoiled the intent and laid bare my dishonesty, in which\nI acknowledged more than there really was to confess.\nThis leads us to those speech disturbances which can no longer be\ndescribed as speech-blunders, for they do not injure the individual\nword, but affect the rhythm and execution of the entire speech, as,\nfor example, the stammering and stuttering of embarrassment. But here,\nas in the former cases, it is the inner conflict that is betrayed to\nus through the disturbance in speech. I really do not believe that any\none will make mistakes in talking in an audience with His Majesty,\nin a serious love declaration, or in defending one\u2019s name and honour\nbefore a jury; in short, people make no mistakes where _they are all\nthere_, as the saying goes. Even in criticizing an author\u2019s style we\nare allowed and accustomed to follow the principle of explanation,\nwhich we cannot miss in the origin of a single speech-blunder. A\nclear and unequivocal manner of writing shows us that here the author\nis in harmony with himself, but where we find a forced and involved\nexpression, aiming at more than one target, as appropriately expressed,\nwe can thereby recognize the participation of an unfinished and\ncomplicated thought, or we can hear through it the stifled voice of\nthe author\u2019s self-criticism.[23]\nVI\nMISTAKES IN READING AND WRITING\nThat the same view-points and observation should hold true for mistakes\nin reading and writing as for lapses in speech is not at all surprising\nwhen one remembers the inner relation of these functions. I shall here\nconfine myself to the reports of several carefully analysed examples\nand shall make no attempt to include all of the phenomena.\nA. LAPSES IN READING.\n(_a_) While looking over a number of the _Leipziger Illustrierten_,\nwhich I was holding obliquely, I read as the title of the front-page\npicture, \u201cA Wedding Celebration in the Odyssey.\u201d Astonished and with my\nattention aroused, I moved the page into the proper position only to\nread correctly, \u201cA Wedding Celebration in the Ostsee (Baltic Sea).\u201d How\ndid this senseless mistake in reading come about?\nImmediately my thoughts turned to a book by Ruth, _Experimental\nInvestigations of \u201cMusic Phantoms\u201d_, etc., with which I had recently\nbeen much occupied, as it closely touched the psychologic problems\nthat are of interest to me. The author promised a work in the near\nfuture to be called _Analysis and Principles of Dream Phenomena_. No\nwonder that I, having just published an _Interpretation of Dreams_,\nawaited the appearance of this book with the most intense interest. In\nRuth\u2019s work concerning music phantoms I found an announcement in the\nbeginning of the table of contents of the detailed inductive proof that\nthe old Hellenic myths and traditions originated mainly from slumber\nand music phantoms, from dream phenomena and from deliria. Thereupon I\nhad immediately plunged into the text in order to find out whether he\nwas also aware that the scene where Odysseus appears before Nausicaa\nwas based upon the common dream of nakedness. One of my friends\ncalled my attention to the clever passage in G. Keller\u2019s _Gr\u00fcnem\nHeinrich_, which explains this episode in the Odyssey as an objective\nrepresentation of the dream of the mariner straying far from home. I\nadded to it the reference to the exhibition dream of nakedness.[24]\n(_b_) A woman who is very anxious to get children always reads _storks_\ninstead of _stocks_.\n(_c_) One day I received a letter which contained very disturbing news.\nI immediately called my wife and informed her that poor Mrs. Wm. H.\nwas seriously ill and was given up by the doctors. There must have been\na false ring to the words in which I expressed my sympathy, as my wife\ngrew suspicious, asked to see the letter, and expressed her opinion\nthat it could not read as stated by me, because no one calls the wife\nby the husband\u2019s name. Moreover, the correspondent was well acquainted\nwith the Christian name of the woman concerned. I defended my assertion\nobstinately and referred to the customary visiting-cards, on which a\nwoman designates herself by the Christian name of her husband. I was\nfinally compelled to take up the letter, and, as a matter of fact, we\nread therein \u201cPoor W. M.\u201d What is more, I had even overlooked \u201cPoor Dr.\nW. M.\u201d My mistake in reading signified a spasmodic effort, so to speak,\nto turn the sad news from the man towards the woman. The title between\nthe adjective and the name did not go well with my claim that the woman\nmust have been meant. That is why it was omitted in the reading. The\nmotive for this falsifying was not that the woman was less an object\nof my sympathy than the man, but the fate of this poor man had excited\nmy fears regarding another and nearer person who, I was aware, had the\nsame disease.\n(_d_) Both irritating and laughable is a lapse in reading to which I am\nfrequently subject when I walk through the streets of a strange city\nduring my vacation. I then read _antiquities_ on every shop sign that\nshows the slightest resemblance to the word; this displays the questing\nspirit of the collector.\n(_e_) In his important work[25] Bleuler relates: \u201cWhile reading I\nonce had the intellectual feeling of seeing my name two lines below.\nTo my astonishment I found only the words blood corpuscles. Of the\nmany thousands of lapses in reading in the peripheral as well as in\nthe central field of vision that I have analysed, this was the most\nstriking case. Whenever I imagined that I saw my name, the word that\ninduced this illusion usually showed a greater resemblance to my name\nthan the word _bloodcorpuscles_. In most cases all the letters of my\nname had to be close together before I could commit such an error. In\nthis case, however, I could readily explain the delusion of reference\nand the illusion. What I had just read was the end of a statement\nconcerning a form of bad style in scientific works, a tendency from\nwhich I am not entirely free.\u201d\nB. LAPSES IN WRITING.\n(_a_) On a sheet of paper containing principally short daily notes\nof business interest, I found, to my surprise, the incorrect date,\n\u201cThursday, October 20th,\u201d bracketed under the correct date of the\nmonth of September. It was not difficult to explain this anticipation\nas the expression of a wish. A few days before I had returned fresh\nfrom my vacation and felt ready for any amount of professional work,\nbut as yet there were few patients. On my arrival I had found a letter\nfrom a patient announcing her arrival on the 20th of October. As I\nwrote the same date in September I may certainly have thought \u201cX. ought\nto be here already; what a pity about that whole month!\u201d and with this\nthought I pushed the current date a month ahead. In this case the\ndisturbing thought can scarcely be called unpleasant; therefore after\nnoticing this lapse in writing, I immediately knew the solution. In\nthe fall of the following year I experienced an entirely analogous\nand similarly motivated lapse in writing. E. Jones has made a study\nof similar cases, and found that most mistakes in writing dates are\nmotivated.\n(_b_) I received the proof sheets of my contribution to the annual\nreport on neurology and psychiatry, and I was naturally obliged to\nreview with special care the names of authors, which, because of\nthe many different nationalities represented, offer the greatest\ndifficulties to the compositor. As a matter of fact, I found some\nstrange-sounding names still in need of correction; but, oddly enough,\nthe compositor had corrected one single name in my manuscript,\nand with very good reason. I had written _Buckrhard_, which the\ncompositor guessed to be _Burckhard_. I had praised the treatise of\nthis obstetrician entitled _The Influence of Birth on the Origin of\nInfantile Paralysis_, and I was not conscious of the least enmity\ntoward him. But an author in Vienna, who had angered me by an adverse\ncriticism of my _Traumdeutung_, bears the same name. It was as if in\nwriting the name Burckhard, meaning the obstetrician, a wicked thought\nconcerning the other B. had obtruded itself. The twisting of the name,\nas I have already stated in regard to lapses in speech, often signifies\na depreciation.[26]\n(_c_) The following is seemingly a serious case of _lapsus calami_,\nwhich it would be equally correct to describe as an erroneously carried\nout action. I intended to withdraw from the postal savings bank the sum\nof 300 crowns, which I wished to send to an absent relative to enable\nhim to take treatment at a watering-place. I noted that my account was\n4,380 crowns, and I decided to bring it down to the round sum of 4,000\ncrowns, which was not to be touched in the near future. After making\nout the regular cheque I suddenly noticed that I had written not 380\ncrowns, as I had intended, but exactly 438 crowns. I was frightened\nat the untrustworthiness of my action. I soon realized that my fear\nwas groundless, as I had not grown poorer than I was before. But I\nhad to reflect for quite a while in order to discover what influence\ndiverted me from my first intention without making itself known to my\nconsciousness.\nFirst I got on a wrong track: I subtracted 380 from 438, but after that\nI did not know what to do with the difference. Finally an idea occurred\nto me which showed me the true connection. 438 is exactly 10 per cent.\nof the entire account of 4,380 crowns! But the bookseller, too, gives a\n10 per cent. discount! I recalled that a few days before I had selected\nseveral books, in which I was no longer interested, in order to offer\nthem to the bookseller for 300 crowns. He thought the price demanded\ntoo high, but promised to give me a final answer within the next few\ndays. If he should accept my first offer he would replace the exact sum\nthat I was to spend on the sufferer. There is no doubt that I was sorry\nabout this expenditure. The emotion at the realization of my mistakes\ncan be more easily understood as a fear of growing poor through such\noutlays. But both the sorrow over this expense and the fear of poverty\nconnected with it were entirely foreign to my consciousness; I did not\nregret this expense when I promised the sum, and would have laughed\nat the idea of any such underlying motive. I should probably not have\nassigned such feelings to myself had not my psychoanalytic practice\nmade me quite familiar with the repressed elements of psychic life, and\nif I had not had a dream a few days before which brought forth the same\nsolution.\n(_d_) Although it is usually difficult to find the person responsible\nfor printers\u2019 errors, the psychologic mechanisms underlying them\nare the same as in other mistakes. Typographical errors also well\ndemonstrate the fact that people are not at all indifferent to such\ntrivialities as \u201cmistakes,\u201d and, judging by the indignant reactions of\nthe parties concerned, one is forced to the conclusion that mistakes\nare not treated by the public at large as mere accidents. This state\nof affairs is very well summed up in the following editorial from the\n_New York Times_ of April 14, 1913. Not the least interesting are the\ncomments of the keen-witted editor, who seems to share our views:--\n\u201cA BLUNDER TRULY UNFORTUNATE.\n\u201cTypographical errors come only too frequently from even the\nbest-regulated newspaper presses. They are always humiliating, often\na cause of anger, and occasionally dangerous, but now and then they\nare distinctly amusing. This latter quality they are most apt to have\nwhen they are made in the office of a journalistic neighbour, a fact\nthat probably explains why we can read with smiling composure an\nelaborate editorial apology which appears in the _Hartford Courant_.\n\u201cIts able political commentator tried the other day to say that,\n_unfortunately_ for Connecticut, \u2018J. H. is no longer a Member of\nCongress. Printer and proof-reader combined to deprive the adverb of\nits negative particle.\u2019 At least, the able political commentator so\ndeclares, and we wouldn\u2019t question his veracity for the world; but\nsorrowful experience has taught most of us that it\u2019s safer to get\nthat sort of editorial disclaimer of responsibility into print before\nlooking up the copy, and perhaps--just perhaps--the world-enlightener,\nwho _knows_ that he wrote _unfortunate_, because that is what he\nintended to write, didn\u2019t rashly chance the discovery of his own guilt\nbefore he convicted the composing-room of it.\n\u201cBe that as it may, the meaning of the sentence was cruelly changed,\nand a friend was grieved or offended. Not so long ago a more\nastonishing error than this one crept into a book review of ours--a\nvery solemn and scientific book. It consisted of the substitution\nof the word \u2018caribou\u2019 for the word \u2018carbon\u2019 in a paragraph dealing\nwith the chemical composition of the stars. In that case the writer\u2019s\nfierce self-exculpation is at least highly plausible, as it seems\nhardly possible that he wrote \u2018caribou\u2019 when he intended to write\n\u2018carbon,\u2019 but even he was cautious enough to make no deep inquiry into\nthe matter.\u201d\n(_e_) I cite the following case contributed by Dr. W. Stekel, for\nthe authenticity of which I can vouch: \u201cAn almost unbelievable\nexample of miswriting and misreading occurred in the editing of a\nwidely circulated weekly. It concerned an article of defence and\nvindication which was written with much warmth and great pathos. The\neditor-in-chief of the paper read the article, while the author himself\nnaturally read it from the manuscript and proof-sheets more than once.\nEverybody was satisfied, when the printer\u2019s reader suddenly noticed\na slight error which had escaped the attention of all. There it was,\nplainly enough: \u2018Our readers will bear witness to the fact that we have\nalways acted in a _selfish_ manner for the good of the community.\u2019\nIt is quite evident that it was meant to read _unselfish_. The real\nthoughts, however, broke through the pathetic speech with elemental\nforce.\u201d\n(_f_) The following example of misprinting is taken from a Western\ngazette: The teacher was giving an instruction paper on mathematical\nmethods, and spoke of a plan \u201cfor the instruction of youth that might\nbe carried out _ad libidinem_.\u201d\n(_g_) Even the Bible did not escape misprints. Thus we have the \u201cWicked\nBible,\u201d so called from the fact that the negative was left out of the\nseventh commandment. This authorized edition of the Bible was published\nin London in 1631, and it is said that the printer had to pay a fine of\ntwo thousand pounds for the omission.\nAnother biblical misprint dates back to the year 1580, and is found\nin the Bible of the famous library of Wolfenbuttel, in Hesse. In the\npassage in Genesis where God tells Eve that Adam shall be her master\nand shall rule over her, the German translation is \u201c_Und er soll dein\nHerr sein_.\u201d The word _Herr_ (master) was substituted by _Narr_, which\nmeans fool. Newly discovered evidence seems to show that the error was\na conscious machination of the printer\u2019s suffragette wife, who refused\nto be ruled by her husband.\n(_h_) Dr. Ernest Jones reports the following case concerning A. A.\nBrill: \u201cAlthough by custom almost a teetotaler, he yielded to a\nfriend\u2019s importunity one evening, in order to avoid offending him,\nand took a little wine. During the next morning an exacerbation of an\neye-strain headache gave him cause to regret this slight indulgence,\nand his reflection on the subject found expression in the following\nslip of the pen. Having occasion to write the name of a girl mentioned\nby a patient, he wrote not Ethel but Ethyl.[27] It happened that the\ngirl in question was rather too fond of drink, and in Dr. Brill\u2019s mood\nat the time this characteristic of hers stood out with conspicuous\nsignificance.\u201d[28]\n(_i_) A woman wrote to her sister, felicitating her on the occasion\nof taking possession of a new and spacious residence. A friend who\nwas present noticed that the writer put the wrong address on the\nletter, and what was still more remarkable was the fact that she did\nnot address it to the previous residence, but to one long ago given\nup, but which her sister had occupied when she first married. When\nthe friend called her attention to it the writer remarked, \u201cYou are\nright; but what in the world made me do this?\u201d to which her friend\nreplied: \u201cPerhaps you begrudge her the nice big apartment into which\nshe has just moved because you yourself are cramped for space, and\nfor that reason you put her back into her first residence, where she\nwas no better off than yourself.\u201d \u201cOf course I begrudge her the new\napartment,\u201d she honestly admitted. As an afterthought she added, \u201cIt is\na pity that one is so mean in such matters.\u201d\n(_k_) Ernest Jones reports the following example given to him by Dr.\nA. A. Brill. In a letter to Dr. Brill a patient tried to attribute\nhis nervousness to business worries and excitement during the cotton\ncrisis. He went on to say: \u201cMy trouble is all due to that d---- frigid\nwave; there isn\u2019t even any seed to be obtained for new crops.\u201d He\nreferred to a cold wave which had destroyed the cotton crops, but\ninstead of writing \u201cwave\u201d he wrote \u201cwife.\u201d In the bottom of his heart\nhe entertained reproaches against his wife on account of her marital\nfrigidity and childlessness, and he was not far from the cognition that\nthe enforced abstinence played no little part in the causation of his\nmalady.\nOmissions in writing are naturally explained in the same manner as\nmistakes in writing. A remarkable example of omission which is of\nhistoric importance was reported by Dr. B. Dattner.[29] In one of\nthe legal articles dealing with the financial obligations of both\ncountries, which was drawn up in the year 1867 during the readjustment\nbetween Austria and Hungary, the word \u201ceffective\u201d was accidentally\nomitted in the Hungarian translation. Dattner thinks it probable that\nthe unconscious desire of the Hungarian law-makers to grant Austria the\nleast possible advantages had something to do with this omission.\nAnother example of omission is the following related by Brill:\n\u201cA prospective patient, who had corresponded with me relative to\ntreatment, finally wrote for an appointment for a certain day. Instead\nof keeping his appointment he sent regrets which began as follows:\n\u2018Owing to _foreseen_ circumstances I am unable to keep my appointment.\u2019\nHe naturally meant to write _unforeseen_. He finally came to me\nmonths later, and in the course of the analysis I discovered that\nmy suspicions at the time were justified; there were no unforeseen\ncircumstances to prevent his coming at that time; he was advised not to\ncome to me. The unconscious does not lie.\u201d\nWundt gives a most noteworthy proof for the easily ascertained fact\nthat we more easily make mistakes in writing than in speaking (_loc.\ncit._, p. 374). He states: \u201cIn the course of normal conversation the\ninhibiting function of the will is constantly directed toward bringing\ninto harmony the course of ideation with the movement of articulation.\nIf the articulation following the ideas becomes retarded through\nmechanical causes, as in writing, such anticipations then readily make\ntheir appearance.\u201d\nObservation of the determinants which favour lapses in reading gives\nrise to doubt, which I do not like to leave unmentioned, because I am\nof the opinion that it may become the starting-point of a fruitful\ninvestigation. It is a familiar fact that in reading aloud the\nattention of the reader often wanders from the text and is directed\ntoward his own thoughts. The results of this deviation of attention\nare often such that when interrupted and questioned he cannot even\nstate what he has read. In other words, he has read automatically,\nalthough the reading was nearly always correct. I do not think that\nsuch conditions favour any noticeable increase in the mistakes. We are\naccustomed to assume concerning a whole series of functions that they\nare most precisely performed when done automatically, with scarcely\nany conscious attention. This argues that the conditions governing\nattention in mistakes in speaking, writing, and reading must be\ndifferently determined than assumed by Wundt (cessation or diminution\nof attention). The examples which we have subjected to analysis have\nreally not given us the right to take for granted a quantitative\ndiminution of attention. We found what is probably not exactly the\nsame thing, a disturbance of the attention through a strange obtruding\nthought.\nVII\nFORGETTING OF IMPRESSIONS AND RESOLUTIONS\nIf any one should be inclined to overrate the state of our present\nknowledge of mental life, all that would be needed to force him to\nassume a modest attitude would be to remind him of the function of\nmemory. No psychologic theory has yet been able to account for the\nconnection between the fundamental phenomena of remembering and\nforgetting; indeed, even the complete analysis of that which one can\nactually observe has as yet scarcely been grasped. To-day forgetting\nhas perhaps grown more puzzling than remembering, especially since\nwe have learned from the study of dreams and pathologic states that\neven what for a long time we believed forgotten may suddenly return to\nconsciousness.\nTo be sure, we are in possession of some view-points which we hope\nwill receive general recognition. Thus we assume that forgetting is\na spontaneous process to which we may ascribe a certain temporal\ndischarge. We emphasize the fact that, just as among the units of\nevery impression or experience, in forgetting, too, a certain selection\ntakes place among the existing impressions. We are acquainted with some\nof the conditions that underlie the tenaciousness of memory and the\nawakening of that which would otherwise remain forgotten. Nevertheless,\nwe can observe in innumerable cases of daily life how unreliable and\nunsatisfactory our knowledge of the mechanism is. Thus we may listen\nto two persons exchanging reminiscences concerning the same outward\nimpressions, say of a journey that they have taken together some time\nbefore. What remains most firmly in the memory of the one is often\nforgotten by the other, as if it had never occurred, even when there\nis not the slightest reason to assume that this impression is of\ngreater psychic importance for the one than for the other. A great many\nof those factors which determine the selective power of memory are\nobviously still beyond our ken.\nWith the purpose of adding some small contribution to the knowledge of\nthe conditions of forgetting, I was wont to subject to a psychologic\nanalysis those cases in which forgetting concerned me personally. As\na rule I took up only a certain group of those cases, namely, those\nin which the forgetting astonished me, because, in my opinion, I\nshould have remembered the experience in question. I wish further to\nremark that I am generally not inclined to forgetfulness (of things\nexperienced, not of things learned), and that for a short period of my\nyouth I was able to perform extraordinary feats of memory. When I was a\nschoolboy it was quite natural for me to be able to repeat from memory\nthe page of a book which I had read; and shortly before I entered the\nUniversity I could write down practically verbatim the popular lectures\non scientific subjects directly after hearing them. In the tension\nbefore the final medical examination I must have made use of the\nremnant of this ability, for in certain subjects I gave the examiners\napparently automatic answers, which proved to be exact reproductions\nof the text-book, which I had skimmed through but once and then in\ngreatest haste.\nSince those days I have steadily lost control over my memory; of\nlate, however, I became convinced that with the aid of a certain\nartifice I can recall far more than I would otherwise credit myself\nwith remembering. For example, when, during my office hours, a patient\nstates that I have seen him before and I cannot recall either the fact\nor the time, then I help myself by guessing--that is, I allow a number\nof years, beginning from the present time, to come to my mind quickly.\nWhenever this could be controlled by records of definite information\nfrom the patient, it was always shown that in over ten years[30] I\nhave seldom missed it by more than six months. The same thing happens\nwhen I meet a casual acquaintance and, from politeness, inquire about\nhis small child. When he tells of its progress I try to fancy how\nold the child now is. I control my estimate by the information given\nby the father, and at most I make a mistake of a month, and in older\nchildren of three months. I cannot state, however, what basis I have\nfor this estimate. Of late I have grown so bold that I always offer my\nestimate spontaneously, and still run no risk of grieving the father by\ndisplaying my ignorance in regard to his offspring. Thus I extend my\nconscious memory by invoking my larger unconscious memory.\nI shall report some _striking_ examples of forgetting which for the\nmost part I have observed in myself. I distinguish forgetting of\nimpressions and experiences, that is, the forgetting of knowledge, from\nforgetting of resolutions, that is, the forgetting of omissions. The\nuniform result of the entire series of observations I can formulate\nas follows: _The forgetting in all cases is proved to be founded on a\nmotive of displeasure._\nA. FORGETTING OF IMPRESSIONS AND KNOWLEDGE.\n(_a_) During the summer my wife once made me very angry, although\nthe cause in itself was trifling. We sat in a restaurant opposite a\ngentleman from Vienna whom I knew, and who had cause to know me, and\nwhose acquaintance I had reasons for not wishing to renew. My wife,\nwho had heard nothing to the disrepute of the man opposite her, showed\nby her actions that she was listening to his conversation with his\nneighbours, for from time to time she asked me questions which took\nup the thread of their discussion. I became impatient and finally\nirritated. A few weeks later I complained to a relative about this\nbehaviour on the part of my wife, but I was not able to recall even\na single word of the conversation of the gentleman in the case. As I\nam usually rather resentful and cannot forget a single incident of an\nepisode that has annoyed me, my amnesia in this case was undoubtedly\ndetermined by respect for my wife.\nA short time ago I had a similar experience. I wished to make merry\nwith an intimate friend over a statement made by my wife only a few\nhours earlier, but I found myself hindered by the noteworthy fact that\nI had entirely forgotten the statement. I had first to beg my wife to\nrecall it to me. It is easy to understand that my forgetting in this\ncase may be analogous to the typical disturbance of judgment which\ndominates us when it concerns those nearest to us.\n(_b_) To oblige a woman who was a stranger in Vienna I had undertaken\nto procure a small iron safe for the preservation of documents and\nmoney. When I offered my services, the image of an establishment in\nthe heart of the city where I was sure I had seen such safes floated\nbefore me with extraordinary visual vividness. To be sure, I could\nnot recall the name of the street, but I felt certain that I would\ndiscover the store in a walk through the city, for my memory told me\nthat I had passed it countless times. To my chagrin I could not find\nthis establishment with the safes, though I walked through the inner\npart of the city in every direction. I concluded that the only thing\nleft to do was to search through a business directory, and if that\nfailed, to try to identify the establishment in a second round of the\ncity. It did not, however, require so much effort; among the addresses\nin the directory I found one which immediately presented itself as\nthat which had been forgotten. It was true that I had passed the show\nwindow countless times, each time, however, when I had gone to visit\nthe M. family, who have lived a great many years in this identical\nbuilding. After this intimate friendship had turned to an absolute\nestrangement, I had taken care to avoid the neighbourhood as well as\nthe house, though without ever thinking of the reason for my action. In\nmy walk through the city searching for the safe in the show window I\nhad traversed every street in the neighbourhood but the right one, and\nI had avoided this as if it were forbidden ground.\nThe motive of displeasure which was at the bottom of my disorientation\nis thus comprehensible. But the mechanism of forgetting is no longer so\nsimple as in the former example. Here my aversion naturally does not\nextend to the vendor of safes, but to another person, concerning whom\nI wish to know nothing, and later transfers itself from the latter to\nthis incident where it brings about the forgetting. Similarly, in the\ncase of _Burckhard_ mentioned above, the grudge against the one brought\nabout the error in writing the name of the other. The similarity of\nnames which here established a connection between two essentially\ndifferent streams of thought was accomplished in the showcase window\ninstance by the contiguity of space and the inseparable environment.\nMoreover, this latter case was more closely knit together, for money\nplayed a great part in the causation of the estrangement from the\nfamily living in this house.\n(_c_) The B. and R. Company requested me to pay a professional call\non one of their officers. On my way to him I was engrossed in the\nthought that I must already have been in the building occupied by the\nfirm. It seemed as if I used to see their signboard in a lower story\nwhile my professional visit was taking me to a higher story. I could\nnot recall, however, which house it was nor when I had called there.\nAlthough the entire matter was indifferent and of no consequence, I\nnevertheless occupied myself with it, and at last learned in the usual\nroundabout way, by collecting the thoughts that occurred to me in this\nconnection, that one story above the floor occupied by the firm B. and\nR. was the _Pension Fischer_, where I had frequently visited patients.\nThen I remembered the building which sheltered both the company and the\n_pension_.\nI was still puzzled, however, as to the motive that entered into\nplay in this forgetting. I found nothing disagreeable in my memory\nconcerning the firm itself or the _Pension Fischer_, or the patients\nliving there. I was also aware that it could not deal with anything\nvery painful, otherwise I hardly would have been successful in tracing\nthe thing forgotten in a roundabout way without resorting to external\naid, as happened in the preceding example. Finally it occurred to me\nthat a little before, while starting on my way to a new patient, a\ngentleman whom I had difficulty in recalling greeted me in the street.\nSome months previously I had seen this man in an apparently serious\ncondition and had made the diagnosis of general paresis, but later\nI had learned of his recovery, consequently my judgment had been\nincorrect. Was it not possible that we had in this case a remission,\nwhich one usually finds in _dementia paralytica_? In that contingency\nmy diagnosis would still be justified. The influence emanating from\nthis meeting caused me to forget the neighbourhood of the B. and\nR. Company, and my interest to discover the thing forgotten was\ntransferred from this case of disputed diagnosis. But the associative\nconnection in this loose inner relation was effected by means of a\nsimilarity of names: the man who recovered, contrary to expectation,\nwas also an officer of a large company that recommends patients to me.\nAnd the physician with whom I had seen the supposed paretic bore the\nname of Fischer, the name of the _pension_ in the house which I had\nforgotten.\n(_d_) Mislaying a thing really has the same significance as forgetting\nwhere we have placed it. Like most people delving in pamphlets and\nbooks, I am well oriented about my desk, and can produce what I want\nwith one lunge. What appears to others as disorder has become for\nme perfect order. Why, then, did I mislay a catalogue which was\nsent to me not long ago so that it could not be found? What is more,\nit had been my intention to order a book which I found announced\ntherein, entitled _Ueber die Sprache_, because it was written by an\nauthor whose spirited, vivacious style I like, whose insight into\npsychology and whose knowledge of the cultural world I have learned\nto appreciate. I believe that was just why I mislaid the catalogue.\nIt was my habit to lend the books of this author among my friends for\ntheir enlightenment, and a few days before, on returning one, somebody\nhad said: \u201cHis style reminds me altogether of yours, and his way of\nthinking is identical.\u201d The speaker did not know what he was stirring\nup with this remark. Years ago, when I was younger and in greater need\nof forming alliances, I was told practically the same thing by an\nolder colleague, to whom I had recommended the writings of a familiar\nmedical author. To put it in his words, \u201cIt is absolutely your style\nand manner.\u201d I was so influenced by these remarks that I wrote a letter\nto this author with the object of bringing about a closer relation, but\na rather cool answer put me back \u201cin my place.\u201d Perhaps still earlier\ndiscouraging experiences conceal themselves behind this last one,\nfor I did not find the mislaid catalogue. Through this premonition I\nwas actually prevented from ordering the advertised book, although\nthe disappearance of the catalogue formed no real hindrance, as I\nremembered well both the name of the book and the author.\n(_e_) Another case of mislaying merits our interest on account of\nthe conditions under which the mislaid object was rediscovered. A\nyounger man narrates as follows: \u201cSeveral years ago there were some\nmisunderstandings between me and my wife. I found her too cold, and\nthough I fully appreciated her excellent qualities, we lived together\nwithout evincing any tenderness for each other. One day on her return\nfrom a walk she gave me a book which she had bought because she thought\nit would interest me. I thanked her for this mark of \u2018attention,\u2019\npromised to read the book, put it away, and did not find it again. So\nmonths passed, during which I occasionally remembered the lost book,\nand also tried in vain to find it.\n\u201cAbout six months later my beloved mother, who was not living with\nus, became ill. My wife left home to nurse her mother-in-law. The\npatient\u2019s condition became serious and gave my wife the opportunity\nto show the best side of herself. One evening I returned home full of\nenthusiasm over what my wife had accomplished, and felt very grateful\nto her. I stepped to my desk and, without definite intention but with\nthe certainty of a somnambulist, I opened a certain drawer, and in the\nvery top of it I found the long-missing, mislaid book.\u201d\nThe following example of \u201cmisplacing\u201d belongs to a type well known to\nevery psychoanalyst. I must add that the patient who experienced this\nmisplacing has himself found the solution of it.\nThis patient, whose psychoanalytic treatment had to be interrupted\nthrough the summer vacation when he was in a state of resistance and\nill-health, put away his keys in the evening in their usual place, or\nso he thought. He then remembered that he wished to take some things\nfrom his desk, where he also had put the money which he needed on the\njourney. He was to depart the next day, which was the last day of\ntreatment and the date when the doctor\u2019s fee was due. But the keys had\ndisappeared.\nHe began a thorough and systematic search through his small apartment.\nHe became more and more excited over it, but his search was\nunsuccessful. As he recognized this \u201cmisplacement\u201d as a symptomatic\nact--that is, as being intentional--he aroused his servant in order\nto continue his search with the help of an \u201cunprejudiced\u201d person.\nAfter another hour he gave up the search and feared that he had lost\nthe keys. The next morning he ordered new keys from the desk factory,\nwhich were hurriedly made for him. Two acquaintances who had been with\nhim in a cab even recalled hearing something fall to the ground as he\nstepped out of the cab, and he was therefore convinced that the keys\nhad slipped from his pocket. They were found lying between a thick book\nand a thin pamphlet, the latter a work of one of my pupils, which he\nwished to take along as reading matter for his vacation; and they were\nso skilfully placed that no one would have supposed that they were\nthere. He himself was unable to replace the keys in such a position as\nto render them invisible. The unconscious skill with which an object\nis misplaced on account of secret but strong motives reminds one of\n\u201csomnambulistic sureness.\u201d The motive was naturally ill-humour over the\ninterruption of the treatment and the secret rage over the fact that he\nhad to pay such a high fee when he felt so ill.\n(_f_) Brill relates:[31] \u201cA man was urged by his wife to attend a\nsocial function in which he really took no interest. Yielding to his\nwife\u2019s entreaties, he began to take his dress-suit from the trunk when\nhe suddenly thought of shaving. After accomplishing this he returned to\nthe trunk and found it locked. Despite a long, earnest search the key\ncould not be found. A locksmith could not be found on Sunday evening,\nso that the couple had to send their regrets. On having the trunk\nopened the next morning the lost key was found within. The husband had\nabsent-mindedly dropped the key into the trunk and sprung the lock. He\nassured me that this was wholly unintentional and unconscious, but we\nknow that he did not wish to go to this social affair. The mislaying of\nthe key therefore lacked no motive.\u201d\nErnest Jones noticed in himself that he was in the habit of mislaying\nhis pipe whenever he suffered from the effects of over-smoking. The\npipe was then found in some unusual place where it did not belong and\nwhich it normally did not occupy.\nIf one looks over the cases of mislaying it will be difficult to assume\nthat mislaying is anything other than the result of an unconscious\nintention.\n(_g_) In the summer of 1901 I once remarked to a friend with whom I\nwas then actively engaged in exchanging ideas on scientific questions:\n\u201cThese neurotic problems can be solved only if we take the position of\nabsolutely accepting an original bi-sexuality in every individual.\u201d To\nwhich he replied: \u201cI told you that two and a half years ago while we\nwere taking an evening walk in Br. At that time you wouldn\u2019t listen to\nit.\u201d\nIt is truly painful to be thus requested to renounce one\u2019s originality.\nI could neither recall such a conversation nor my friend\u2019s revelation.\nOne of us must be mistaken; and according to the principle of the\nquestion _cui prodest_? I must be the one. Indeed, in the course of\nthe following weeks everything came back to me just as my friend had\nrecalled it. I myself remembered that at that time I gave the answer:\n\u201cI have not yet got so far, and I do not care to discuss it.\u201d But since\nthis incident I have grown more tolerant when I miss any mention of my\nname in medical literature in connection with ideas for which I deserve\ncredit.\nIt is scarcely accidental that the numerous examples of forgetting\nwhich have been collected without any selection should require for\ntheir solution the introduction of such painful themes as exposing of\none\u2019s wife; a friendship that has turned into the opposite; a mistake\nin medical diagnosis; enmity on account of similar pursuits, or the\nborrowing of somebody\u2019s ideas. I am rather inclined to believe that\nevery person who will undertake an inquiry into the motives underlying\nhis forgetting will be able to fill up a similar sample card of\nvexatious circumstances. The tendency to forget the disagreeable seems\nto me to be quite general; the capacity for it is naturally differently\ndeveloped in different persons. Certain _denials_ which we encounter\nin medical practice can probably be ascribed to _forgetting_.[32] Our\nconception of such forgetting confines the distinction between this and\nthat behaviour to purely psychologic relations, and permits us to see\nin both forms of reaction the expression of the same motive. Of the\nnumerous examples of denials of unpleasant recollection which I have\nobserved in kinsmen of patients, one remains in my memory as especially\nsingular.\nA mother telling me of the childhood of her nervous son, now in his\npuberty, made the statement that, like his brothers and sisters, he\nwas subject to bed-wetting throughout his childhood, a symptom which\ncertainly has some significance in a history of a neurotic patient.\nSome weeks later, while seeking information regarding the treatment, I\nhad occasion to call her attention to signs of a constitutional morbid\npredisposition in the young man, and at the same time referred to the\nbed-wetting recounted in the anamnesis. To my surprise she contested\nthis fact concerning him, denying it as well for the other children,\nand asked me how I could possibly know this. Finally I let her know\nthat she herself had told me a short time before what she had thus\nforgotten.[33]\nOne also finds abundant indications which show that even in healthy,\nnot neurotic, persons resistances are found against the memory of\ndisagreeable impressions and the idea of painful thoughts.[34] But the\nfull significance of this fact can be estimated only when we enter\ninto the psychology of neurotic persons. One is forced to make such\nelementary defensive striving against ideas which can awaken painful\nfeelings, a striving which can be put side by side only with the\nflight-reflex in painful stimuli, as the main pillar of the mechanism\nwhich carries the hysterical symptoms. One need not offer any objection\nto the acceptance of such defensive tendency on the ground that we\nfrequently find it impossible to rid ourselves of painful memories\nwhich cling to us, or to banish such painful emotions as remorse and\nreproaches of conscience. No one maintains that this defensive tendency\ninvariably gains the upper hand, that in the play of psychic forces it\nmay not strike against factors which stir up the contrary feeling for\nother purposes and bring it about in spite of it.\n_As the architectural principle of the psychic apparatus we may\nconjecture a certain stratification or structure of instances deposited\nin strata._ And it is quite possible that this defensive tendency\nbelongs to a lower psychic instance, and is inhibited by higher\ninstances. At all events, it speaks for the existence and force of\nthis defensive tendency, when we can trace it to processes such as\nthose found in our examples of forgetting. We see then that something\nis forgotten for its own sake, and where this is not possible the\ndefensive tendency misses the target and causes something else to\nbe forgotten--something less significant, but which has fallen into\nassociative connection with the disagreeable material.\nThe views here developed, namely, that painful memories merge into\nmotivated forgetting with special ease, merits application in many\nspheres where as yet it has found no, or scarcely any, recognition.\nThus it seems to me that it has not yet been strongly enough emphasized\nin the estimation of testimony taken in court,[35] where the putting\nof a witness under oath obviously leads us to place too great a\ntrust on the purifying influence of his psychic play of forces. It\nis universally admitted that in the origin of the traditions and\nfolklore of a people care must be taken to eliminate from memory\nsuch a motive as would be painful to the national feeling. Perhaps\non closer investigation it may be possible to form a perfect analogy\nbetween the manner of development of national traditions and infantile\nreminiscences of the individual. The great Darwin has formulated a\n\u201cgolden rule\u201d for the scientific worker from his insight into this\npain-motive of forgetting.[36]\nAlmost exactly as in the forgetting of names, faulty recollections can\nalso appear in the forgetting of impressions, and when finding credence\nthey may be designated as delusions of memory. The memory disturbance\nin pathologic cases (in paranoia it actually plays the r\u00f4le of a\nconstituting factor in the formation of delusions) has brought to light\nan extensive literature in which there is no reference whatever to its\nbeing motivated. As this theme also belongs to the psychology of the\nneuroses it goes beyond our present treatment. Instead, I will give\nfrom my own experience a curious example of memory disturbance showing\nclearly enough its determination through unconscious repressed material\nand its connection with this material.\nWhile writing the latter chapters of my volume on the interpretation\nof dreams, I happened to be in a summer resort without access to\nlibraries and reference books, so that I was compelled to introduce\ninto the manuscript all kinds of references and citations from memory.\nThese I naturally reserved for future correction. In the chapter\non day-dreams I thought of the distinguished figure of the poor\nbook-keeper in Alphonse Daudet\u2019s _Nabab_, through whom the author\nprobably described his own day-dreams. I imagined that I distinctly\nremembered one fantasy of this man, whom I called Mr. Jocelyn, which he\nhatched while walking the streets of Paris, and I began to reproduce\nit from memory. This fantasy described how Mr. Jocelyn boldly hurled\nhimself at a runaway horse and brought it to a standstill; how the\ncarriage door opened and a great personage stepped from the coup\u00e9,\npressed Mr. Jocelyn\u2019s hand and said: \u201cYou are my saviour--I owe my life\nto you! What can I do for you?\u201d\nI assured myself that casual inaccuracies in the rendition of this\nfantasy could readily be corrected at home on consulting the book. But\nwhen I perused _Nabab_ in order to compare it with my manuscript, I\nfound to my very great shame and consternation that there was nothing\nto suggest such a dream by Mr. Jocelyn; indeed, the poor book-keeper\ndid not even bear this name--he was called Mr. Joyeuse.\nThis second error then furnished the key for the solution of the first\nmistake, the faulty reminiscence. Joyeux, of which Joyeuse is the\nfeminine form, was the only possible word which would translate my\nown name _Freud_ into French. Whence, therefore, came this falsely\nremembered fantasy which I had attributed to Daudet? It could only be\na product of my own, a day-dream which I myself had spun, and which\ndid not become conscious, or which was once conscious and had since\nbeen absolutely forgotten. Perhaps I invented it myself in Paris, where\nfrequently enough I walked the streets alone, and full of longing for\na helper and protector, until Charcot took me into his circle. I had\noften met the author of _Nabab_ in Charcot\u2019s house. But the provoking\npart of it all is the fact that there is scarcely anything to which I\nam so hostile as the thought of being some one\u2019s prot\u00e9g\u00e9. What we see\nof this sort of thing in our country spoils all desire for it, and my\ncharacter is little suited to the r\u00f4le of a protected child. I have\nalways entertained an immense desire to \u201cbe the strong man myself.\u201d And\nit had to happen that I should be reminded of such a, to be sure, never\nfulfilled, day-dream! Besides, this incident is a good example of how\nthe restraint relation to one\u2019s ego, which breaks forth triumphantly in\nparanoia, disturbs and entangles us in the objective grasp of things.\nAnother case of faulty recollection which can be satisfactorily\nexplained resembles the _fausse reconnaissance_ to be discussed later.\nI related to one of my patients, an ambitious and very capable man,\nthat a young student had recently gained admittance into the circle\nof my pupils by means of an interesting work, _Der K\u00fcnstler, Versuch\neiner Sexualpsychologie_. When, a year and a quarter later, this work\nlay before me in print, my patient maintained that he remembered\nwith certainty having read somewhere, perhaps in a bookseller\u2019s\nadvertisement, the announcement of the same book even before I first\nmentioned it to him. He remembered that this announcement came to his\nmind at that time, and he ascertained besides that the author had\nchanged the title, that it no longer read \u201c_Versuch_\u201d but \u201c_Ans\u00e4tze zu\neiner Sexualpsychologie_.\u201d\nCareful inquiry of the author and comparison of all dates showed\nconclusively that my patient was trying to recall the impossible. No\nnotice of this work had appeared anywhere before its publication,\ncertainly not a year and a quarter before it went to print. However, I\nneglected to seek a solution for this false recollection until the same\nman brought about an equally valuable renewal of it. He thought that he\nhad recently noticed a work on \u201cagoraphobia\u201d in the show window of a\nbookshop, and as he was now looking for it in all available catalogues\nI was able to explain to him why his effort must remain fruitless.\nThe work on agoraphobia existed only in his fantasy as an unconscious\nresolution to write such a book himself. His ambition to emulate\nthat young man, and through such a scientific work to become one of\nmy pupils, had led him to the first as well as to the second false\nrecollection. He also recalled later that the bookseller\u2019s announcement\nwhich had occasioned his false reminiscence dealt with a work entitled\n_Genesis, Das Gesetz der Zeugung_ (\u201cGenesis, The Law of Generation\u201d).\nBut the change in the title as mentioned by him was really instigated\nby me; I recalled that I myself have perpetrated the same inaccuracy\nin the repetition of the title by saying \u201c_Ans\u00e4tze_\u201d in place of\n\u201c_Versuch_.\u201d\nB. FORGETTING OF INTENTIONS.\nNo other group of phenomena is better qualified to demonstrate the\nthesis that lack of attention does not in itself suffice to explain\nfaulty acts as the forgetting of intentions. An intention is an impulse\nfor an action which has already found approbation, but whose execution\nis postponed for a suitable occasion. Now, in the interval thus created\nsufficient change may take place in the motive to prevent the intention\nfrom coming to execution. It is not, however, forgotten, it is simply\nrevised and omitted.\nWe are naturally not in the habit of explaining the forgetting of\nintentions which we daily experience in every possible situation as\nbeing due to a recent change in the adjustment of motives. We generally\nleave it unexplained, or we seek a psychologic explanation in the\nassumption that at the time of execution the required attention for the\naction, which was an indispensable condition for the occurrence of the\nintention, and was then at the disposal of the same action, no longer\nexists. Observation of our normal behaviour towards intentions urges\nus to reject this tentative explanation as arbitrary. If I resolve in\nthe morning to carry out a certain intention in the evening, I may be\nreminded of it several times in the course of the day, but it is not\nat all necessary that it should become conscious throughout the day.\nAs the time for its execution approaches it suddenly occurs to me and\ninduces me to make the necessary preparation for the intended action.\nIf I go walking and take a letter with me to be posted, it is not\nat all necessary that I, as a normal not nervous individual, should\ncarry it in my hand and continually look for a letter-box. As a matter\nof fact I am accustomed to put it in my pocket and give my thoughts\nfree rein on my way, feeling confident that the first letter-box will\nattract my attention and cause me to put my hand in my pocket and draw\nout the letter.\nThis normal behaviour in a formed intention corresponds perfectly\nwith the experimentally produced conduct of persons who are under a\nso-called \u201cpost-hypnotic suggestion\u201d to perform something after a\ncertain time.[37] We are accustomed to describe the phenomenon in\nthe following manner: the suggested intention slumbers in the person\nconcerned until the time for its execution approaches. Then it awakes\nand excites the action.\nIn two positions of life even the layman is cognizant of the fact\nthat forgetting referring to intended purposes can in no wise claim\nconsideration as an elementary phenomenon no further reducible, but\nrealizes that it ultimately depends on unadmitted motives. I refer\nto affairs of love and military service. A lover who is late at the\nappointed place will vainly tell his sweetheart that unfortunately\nhe has entirely forgotten their rendezvous. She will not hesitate\nto answer him: \u201cA year ago you would not have forgotten. Evidently\nyou no longer care for me.\u201d Even if he should grasp the above cited\npsychologic explanation, and should wish to excuse his forgetting\non the plea of important business, he would only elicit the answer\nfrom the woman, who has become as keen-sighted as the physician in\nthe psychoanalytic treatment, \u201cHow remarkable that such business\ndisturbances did not occur before!\u201d Of course the woman does not\nwish to deny the possibility of forgetting; but she believes, and\nnot without reason, that practically the same inference of a certain\nunwillingness may be drawn from the unintentional forgetting as from a\nconscious subterfuge.\nSimilarly, in military service no distinction is recognized between\nan omission resulting from forgetting and one in consequence of\nintentional neglect. And rightly so. The soldier dares forget nothing\nthat military service demands of him. If he forgets in spite of this,\neven when he is acquainted with the demands, then it is due to the fact\nthat the motives which urge the fulfilment of the military exactions\nare opposed by contrary motives. Thus the one year\u2019s volunteer[38] who\nat inspection pleads forgetting as an excuse for not having polished\nhis buttons is sure to be punished. But this punishment is small in\ncomparison to the one he courts if he admits to his superiors that the\nmotive for his negligence is because \u201cthis miserable menial service is\naltogether disgusting to me.\u201d Owing to this saving of punishment for\neconomic reasons, as it were, he makes use of forgetting as an excuse,\nor it comes about as a compromise.\nThe service of women (as well as the military service of the State)\ndemands that nothing relating to that service be subject to forgetting.\nThus it but suggests that forgetting is permissible in unimportant\nmatters, but in weighty matters its occurrence is an indication that\none wishes to treat weighty matters as unimportant: that is, that\ntheir importance is disputed.[39] The view-point of psychic validity\nis in fact not to be contested here. No person forgets to carry out\nactions that seem important to himself without exposing himself to the\nsuspicion of being a sufferer from mental weakness. Our investigations\ntherefore can extend only to the forgetting of more or less secondary\nintentions, for no intention do we deem absolutely indifferent,\notherwise it would certainly never have been formed.\nAs in the preceding functional disturbances, I have collected the cases\nof neglect through forgetting which I have observed in myself, and\nendeavoured to explain them. I have found that they could invariably\nbe traced to some interference of unknown and unadmitted motives--or,\nas may be said, they were due to a counter-will. In a number of\nthese cases I found myself in a position similar to that of being in\nsome distasteful service: I was under a constraint to which I had not\nentirely resigned myself, so that I showed my protest in the form of\nforgetting. This accounts for the fact that I am particularly prone\nto forget to send congratulations on such occasions as birthdays,\njubilees, wedding celebrations, and promotions to higher rank. I\ncontinually make new resolutions, but I am more than ever convinced\nthat I shall not succeed. I am now on the point of giving it up\naltogether, and to admit consciously the striving motives. In a period\nof transition, I told a friend who asked me to send a congratulatory\ntelegram for him, at a certain time when I was to send one myself,\nthat I would probably forget both. It was not surprising that the\nprophecy came true. It is undoubtedly due to painful experiences in\nlife that I am unable to manifest sympathy where this manifestation\nmust necessarily appear exaggerated, for the small amount of my feeling\ndoes not admit the corresponding expression. Since I have learned that\nI often mistook the pretended sympathy of others for real, I am in\nrebellion against the conventions of expressing sympathy, the social\nexpediency of which I naturally acknowledge. Condolences in cases of\ndeath are excepted from this double treatment; once I determine to\nsend them I do not neglect them. Where my emotional participation has\nnothing more to do with social duty, its expression is never inhibited\nby forgetting.\nCases in which we forget to carry out actions which we have promised\nto do as a favour for others can similarly be explained as antagonism\nto conventional duty and as an unfavourable inward opinion. Here\nit regularly proves correct, inasmuch as the only person appealed\nto believes in the excusing power of forgetfulness, while the one\nrequesting the favour has no doubt about the right answer: he has no\ninterest in this matter, otherwise he would not have forgotten it.\nThere are some who are noted as generally forgetful, and we\nexcuse their lapses in the same manner as we excuse those who are\nshort-sighted when they do not greet us in the street.[40] Such persons\nforget all small promises which they have made; they leave unexecuted\nall orders which they have received; they prove themselves unreliable\nin little things; and at the same time demand that we shall not take\nthese slight offences amiss--that is, they do not want us to attribute\nthese failings to personal characteristics but to refer them to an\norganic peculiarity.[41] I am not one of these people myself, and have\nhad no opportunity to analyse the actions of such a person in order to\ndiscover from the selection of forgetting the motive underlying the\nsame. I cannot forego, however, the conjecture _per analogiam_, that\nhere the motive is an unusual large amount of unavowed disregard for\nothers which exploits the constitutional factor for its purpose.[42]\nIn other cases the motives for forgetting are less easy to discover,\nand when found excite greater astonishment. Thus, in former years I\nobserved that of a great number of professional calls I only forgot\nthose that I was to make on patients whom I treated gratis or on\ncolleagues. The mortification caused by this discovery led me to\nthe habit of noting every morning the calls of the day in a form of\nresolution. I do not know if other physicians have come to the same\npractice by a similar road. Thus we get an idea of what causes the\nso-called neurasthenic to make a memorandum of the communications\nhe wishes to make to the doctor. He apparently lacks confidence in\nthe reproductive capacity of his memory. This is true, but the scene\nusually proceeds in this manner. The patient has recounted his various\ncomplaints and inquiries at considerable length. After he has finished\nhe pauses for a moment, then he pulls out the memorandum and says\napologetically, \u201cI have made some notes because I cannot remember\nanything.\u201d As a rule he finds nothing new on the memorandum. He repeats\neach point and answers it himself: \u201cYes, I have already asked about\nthat.\u201d By means of the memorandum he probably only demonstrates one of\nhis symptoms, the frequency with which his resolutions are disturbed\nthrough the interference of obscure motives.\nI am touching, moreover, on an affliction to which even most of my\nhealthy acquaintances are subject, when I admit that especially in\nformer years I had the habit of easily forgetting for a long time\nto return borrowed books, also that it very often happened that I\ndeferred payments through forgetfulness. One morning not long ago I\nleft the tobacco-shop where I make my daily purchase of cigars without\npaying. It was a most harmless omission, as I am known there and could\ntherefore expect to be reminded of my debt the next morning. But\nthis slight neglect, the attempt to contract a debt, was surely not\nunconnected with reflections concerning the budget with which I had\noccupied myself throughout the preceding day. Even among the so-called\nrespectable people one can readily demonstrate a double behaviour when\nit concerns the theme of money and possession. The primitive greed of\nthe suckling which wishes to seize every object (in order to put it in\nits mouth) has generally been only imperfectly subdued through culture\nand training.[43]\nI fear that in all the examples thus far given I have grown quite\ncommonplace. But it can be only a pleasure to me if I happen upon\nfamiliar matters which every one understands, for my main object is\nto collect everyday material and utilize it scientifically. I cannot\nconceive why wisdom, which is, so to speak, the sediment of everyday\nexperiences, should be denied admission among the acquisitions of\nknowledge. For it is not the diversity of objects but the stricter\nmethod of verification and the striving for far-reaching connections\nwhich make up the essential character of scientific work.\nWe have invariably found that intentions of some importance are\nforgotten when obscure motives arise to disturb them. In still less\nimportant intentions we find a second mechanism of forgetting. Here\na counter-will becomes transferred to the resolution from something\nelse after an external association has been formed between the latter\nand the content of the resolution. The following example reported by\nBrill illustrates this: \u201cA patient found that she had suddenly become\nvery negligent in her correspondence. She was naturally punctual and\ntook pleasure in letter-writing, but for the last few weeks she simply\ncould not bring herself to write a letter without exerting the greatest\namount of effort. The explanation was quite simple. Some weeks before\nshe had received an important letter calling for a categorical answer.\nShe was undecided what to say, and therefore did not answer it at all.\nThis indecision in the form of inhibition was unconsciously transferred\nto other letters and caused the inhibition against letter-writing in\ngeneral.\u201d\nDirect counter-will and more remote motivation are found together in\nthe following example of delaying: I had written a short treatise on\nthe dream for the series _Grenzfragen des Nerven- und Seelenlebens_,\nin which I gave an abstract of my book, _The Interpretation of\nDreams_.[44] Bergmann, the publisher, had sent me the proof sheets\nand asked for a speedy return of the same as he wished to issue the\npamphlet before Christmas. I corrected the sheets the same night, and\nplaced them on my desk in order to take them to the post office the\nnext morning. In the morning I forgot all about it, and only thought\nof it in the afternoon at the sight of the paper cover on my desk.\nIn the same way I forgot the proofs that evening and the following\nmorning, and until the afternoon of the second day, when I quickly\ntook them to a letter-box, wondering what might be the basis of this\nprocrastination. Obviously I did not want to send them off, although I\ncould find no explanation for such an attitude.\nAfter posting the letter I entered the shop of my Vienna publisher,\nwho put out my _Interpretation of Dreams_. I left a few orders; then,\nas if impelled by a sudden thought, said, \u201cYou undoubtedly know that\nI have written the \u2018Dream\u2019 book a second time?\u201d \u201cAh!\u201d he exclaimed,\n\u201cthen I must ask you to----\u201d \u201cCalm yourself,\u201d I interposed; \u201cit is only\na short treatise for the L\u00f6wenfeld-Kurella collection.\u201d But still he\nwas not satisfied; he feared that the abstract would hurt the sale of\nthe book. I disagreed with him, and finally asked: \u201cIf I had come to\nyou before, would you have objected to the publication?\u201d \u201cNo; under no\ncircumstances,\u201d he answered.\nPersonally I believe I acted within my full rights and did nothing\ncontrary to the general practice; still it seems certain to me that a\nthought similar to that entertained by the publisher was the motive for\nmy procrastination in dispatching the proof sheets.\nThis reflection leads back to a former occasion when another publisher\nraised some difficulties because I was obliged to take out several\npages of the text from an earlier work on cerebral infantile paralysis,\nand put them unchanged into a work on the same theme in Nothnagel\u2019s\nhandbook. There again the reproach received no recognition; that time\nalso I had loyally informed my first publisher (the same who published\n_The Interpretation of Dreams_) of my intention.\nHowever, if this series of recollections is followed back still farther\nit brings to light a still earlier occasion relating to a translation\nfrom the French, in which I really violated the property rights that\nshould be considered in a publication. I had added notes to the text\nwithout asking the author\u2019s permission, and some years later I had\ncause to think that the author was dissatisfied with this arbitrary\naction.\nThere is a proverb which indicates the popular knowledge that the\nforgetting of intentions is not accidental. It says: \u201cWhat one forgets\nonce he will often forget again.\u201d\nIndeed, we sometimes cannot help feeling that no matter what may be\nsaid about forgetting and faulty actions, the whole subject is already\nknown to everybody as something self-evident. It is strange enough that\nit is still necessary to push before consciousness such well-known\nfacts. How often I have heard people remark: \u201cPlease do not ask me to\ndo this, I shall surely forget it.\u201d The coming true of this prophecy\nlater is surely nothing mysterious in itself. He who speaks thus\nperceives the inner resolution not to carry out the request, and only\nhesitates to acknowledge it to himself.\nMuch light is thrown, moreover, on the forgetting of resolutions\nthrough something which could be designated as \u201cforming false\nresolutions.\u201d I had once promised a young author to write a review of\nhis short work, but on account of inner resistances, not unknown to\nme, I promised him that it would be done the same evening. I really\nhad serious intentions of doing so, but I had forgotten that I had\nset aside that evening for the preparation of an expert testimony\nthat could not be deferred. After I thus recognized my resolution as\nfalse, I gave up the struggle against my resistances and refused the\nauthor\u2019s request.\nVIII\nERRONEOUSLY CARRIED-OUT ACTIONS\nI shall give another passage from the above-mentioned work of Meringer\nand Mayer (p. 98):\n\u201cLapses in speech do not stand entirely alone. They resemble the errors\nwhich often occur in our other activities and are quite foolishly\ntermed \u2018forgetfulness.\u2019\u201d\nI am therefore in no way the first to presume that there is a sense and\npurpose behind the slight functional disturbances of the daily life of\nhealthy people.[45]\nIf the lapse in speech, which is without doubt a motor function,\nadmits of such a conception, it is quite natural to transfer to the\nlapses of our other motor functions the same expectation. I have here\nformed two groups of cases; all these cases in which the faulty effect\nseems to be the essential element--that is, the deviation from the\nintention--I denote as erroneously carried-out actions (_Vergreifen_);\nthe others, in which the entire action appears rather inexpedient,\nI call \u201csymptomatic and chance actions.\u201d But no distinct line of\ndemarcation can be formed; indeed, we are forced to conclude that all\ndivisions used in this treatise are of only descriptive significance\nand contradict the inner unity of the sphere of manifestation.\nThe psychologic understanding of erroneous actions apparently gains\nlittle in clearness when we place it under the head of \u201cataxia,\u201d and\nespecially under \u201ccortical ataxia.\u201d Let us rather try to trace the\nindividual examples to their proper determinants. To do this I shall\nagain resort to personal observations, the opportunities for which I\ncould not very frequently find in myself.\n(_a_) In former years, when I made more calls at the homes of patients\nthan I do at present, it often happened, when I stood before a door\nwhere I should have knocked or rung the bell, that I would pull the\nkey of my own house from my pocket, only to replace it, quite abashed.\nWhen I investigated in what patients\u2019 homes this occurred, I had to\nadmit that the faulty action--taking out my key instead of ringing the\nbell--signified paying a certain tribute to the house where the error\noccurred. It was equivalent to the thought \u201cHere I feel at home,\u201d as\nit happened only where I possessed the patient\u2019s regard. (Naturally, I\nnever rang my own door-bell.)\nThe faulty action was therefore a symbolic representation of a definite\nthought which was not accepted consciously as serious; for in reality\nthe neurologist is well aware that the patient seeks him only so long\nas he expects to be benefited by him, and that his own excessively\nwarm interest for his patient is evinced only as a means of psychic\ntreatment.\nAn almost identical repetition of my experience is described by A.\nMaeder (\u201cContrib. \u00e0 la psychopathologie de la vie quotidienne,\u201d _Arch.\nde Psychol._, vi., 1906): \u201cIl est arriv\u00e9 \u00e0 chacun de sortir son\ntrousseau, en arrivant \u00e0 la porte d\u2019un ami particuli\u00e8rement cher, de se\nsurprendre pour ainsi dire, en train d\u2019ouvrir avec sa cl\u00e9 comme chez\nsoi. C\u2019est un retard, puisqu\u2019il faut sonner malgr\u00e9 tout, mais c\u2019est\nune preuve qu\u2019on se sent--ou qu\u2019on voudrait se sentir--comme chez soi,\naupr\u00e8s de cet ami.\u201d\nJones speaks as follows about the use of keys:[46] \u201cThe use of keys is\na fertile source of occurrences of this kind, of which two examples may\nbe given. If I am disturbed in the midst of some engrossing work at\nhome by having to go to the hospital to carry out some routine work,\nI am very apt to find myself trying to open the door of my laboratory\nthere with the key of my desk at home, although the two keys are quite\nunlike each other. The mistake unconsciously demonstrates where I\nwould rather be at the moment.\n\u201cSome years ago I was acting in a subordinate position at a certain\ninstitution, the front door of which was kept locked, so that it was\nnecessary to ring for admission. On several occasions I found myself\nmaking serious attempts to open the door with my house key. Each one of\nthe permanent visiting staff, of which I aspired to be a member, was\nprovided with a key to avoid the trouble of having to wait at the door.\nMy mistake thus expressed the desire to be on a similar footing and to\nbe quite \u2018at home\u2019 there.\u201d\nA similar experience is reported by Dr. Hans Sachs of Vienna: \u201cI always\ncarry two keys with me, one for the door of my office and one for my\nresidence. They are not by any means easily interchanged, as the office\nkey is at least three times as big as my house key. Besides, I carry\nthe first in my trouser pocket and the other in my vest pocket. Yet it\noften happened that I noticed on reaching the door that while ascending\nthe stairs I had taken out the wrong key. I decided to undertake a\nstatistical examination; as I was daily in about the same emotional\nstate when I stood before both doors, I thought that the interchanging\nof the two keys must show a regular tendency, if they were differently\ndetermined psychically. Observation of later occurrences showed that\nI regularly took out my house key before the office door. Only on one\noccasion was this reversed: I came home tired, knowing that I would\nfind there a guest. I made an attempt to unlock the door with the,\nnaturally too big, office key.\u201d\n(_b_) At a certain time twice a day for six years I was accustomed\nto wait for admission before a door in the second story of the same\nhouse, and during this long period of time it happened twice (within a\nshort interval) that I climbed a story higher. On the first of these\noccasions I was in an ambitious day-dream, which allowed me to \u201cmount\nalways higher and higher.\u201d In fact, at that time I heard the door in\nquestion open as I put my foot on the first step of the third flight.\nOn the other occasion I again went too far \u201cengrossed in thought.\u201d As\nsoon as I became aware of it, I turned back and sought to snatch the\ndominating fantasy; I found that I was irritated over a criticism of\nmy works, in which the reproach was made that I \u201calways went too far,\u201d\nwhich I replaced by the less respectful expression \u201cclimbed too high.\u201d\n(_c_) For many years a reflex hammer and a tuning-fork lay side by side\non my desk. One day I hurried off at the close of my office hours, as\nI wished to catch a certain train, and, despite broad daylight, put\nthe tuning-fork in my coat pocket in place of the reflex hammer. My\nattention was called to the mistake through the weight of the object\ndrawing down my pocket. Any one unaccustomed to reflect on such slight\noccurrences would without hesitation explain the faulty action by the\nhurry of the moment, and excuse it. In spite of that, I preferred to\nask myself why I took the tuning-fork instead of the hammer. The haste\ncould just as well have been a motive for carrying out the action\nproperly in order not to waste time over the correction.\n\u201cWho last grasped the tuning-fork?\u201d was the question which immediately\nflashed through my mind. It happened that only a few days ago an\nidiotic child, whose attention to sensory impressions I was testing,\nhad been so fascinated by the tuning-fork that I found it difficult to\ntear it away from him. Could it mean, therefore, that I was an idiot?\nTo be sure, so it would seem, as the next thought which associated\nitself with the hammer was _chamer_ (Hebrew for \u201cass\u201d).\nBut what was the meaning of this abusive language? We must here inquire\ninto the situation. I hurried to a consultation at a place on the\nWestern railroad to see a patient who, according to the anamnesis which\nI received by letter, had fallen from a balcony some months before,\nand since then had been unable to walk. The physician who invited me\nwrote that he was still unable to say whether he was dealing with a\nspinal injury or traumatic neurosis--hysteria. That was what I was to\ndecide. This could therefore be a reminder to be particularly careful\nin this delicate differential diagnosis. As it is, my colleagues think\nthat hysteria is diagnosed far too carelessly where more serious\nmatters are concerned. But the abuse is not yet justified. Yes, the\nnext association was that the small railroad station is the same place\nin which, some years previous, I saw a young man who, after a certain\nemotional experience, could not walk properly. At that time I diagnosed\nhis malady as hysteria, and later put him under psychic treatment; but\nit afterward turned out that my diagnosis was neither incorrect nor\ncorrect. A large number of the patient\u2019s symptoms were hysterical,\nand they promptly disappeared in the course of treatment. But back\nof these there was a visible remnant that could not be reached by\ntherapy, and could be referred only to a multiple sclerosis. Those who\nsaw the patient after me had no difficulty in recognizing the organic\naffection. I could scarcely have acted or judged differently, still the\nimpression was that of a serious mistake; the promise of a cure which I\nhad given him could naturally not be kept.\nThe mistake in grasping the tuning-fork instead of the hammer could\ntherefore be translated into the following words: \u201cYou fool, you ass,\nget yourself together this time, and be careful not to diagnose again\na case of hysteria where there is an incurable disease, as you did in\nthis place years ago in the case of the poor man!\u201d And fortunately for\nthis little analysis, even if unfortunately for my mood, this same\nman, now having a very spastic gait, had been to my office a few days\nbefore, one day after the examination of the idiotic child.\nWe observe that this time it is the voice of self-criticism which makes\nitself perceptible through the mistake in grasping. The erroneously\ncarried-out action is specially suited to express self-reproach. The\npresent mistake attempts to represent the mistake which was committed\nelsewhere.\n(_d_) It is quite obvious that grasping the wrong thing may also serve\na whole series of other obscure purposes. Here is a first example: It\nis very seldom that I break anything. I am not particularly dexterous,\nbut by virtue of the anatomic integrity of my nervous and muscular\napparatus there are apparently no grounds in me for such awkward\nmovements with undesirable results. I can recall no object in my home\nthe counterpart of which I have ever broken. Owing to the narrowness\nof my study it has often been necessary for me to work in the most\nuncomfortable position among my numerous antique clay and stone\nobjects, of which I have a small collection. So much is this true that\nonlookers have expressed fear lest I topple down something and shatter\nit. But it never happened. Then why did I brush to the floor the cover\nof my simple inkwell so that it broke into pieces?\nMy inkstand is made of a flat piece of marble which is hollowed out\nfor the reception of the glass inkwell; the inkwell has a marble cover\nwith a knob of the same stone. A circle of bronze statuettes with small\nterra-cotta figures is set behind this inkstand. I seated myself at the\ndesk to write, I made a remarkably awkward outward movement with the\nhand holding the pen-holder, and so swept the cover of the inkstand,\nwhich already lay on the desk, to the floor.\nIt is not difficult to find the explanation. Some hours before my\nsister had been in the room to look at some of my new acquisitions. She\nfound them very pretty, and then remarked: \u201cNow the desk really looks\nvery well, only the inkstand does not match. You must get a prettier\none.\u201d I accompanied my sister out and did not return for several hours.\nBut then, as it seems, I performed the execution of the condemned\ninkstand.\nDid I perhaps conclude from my sister\u2019s words that she intended to\npresent me with a prettier inkstand on the next festive occasion, and\ndid I shatter the unsightly old one in order to force her to carry out\nher signified intention? If that be so, then my swinging motion was\nonly apparently awkward; in reality it was most skilful and designed,\nas it understood how to avoid all the valuable objects located near it.\nI actually believe that we must accept this explanation for a whole\nseries of seemingly accidental awkward movements. It is true that\non the surface these seem to show something violent and irregular,\nsimilar to spastic-ataxic movements, but on examination they seem to\nbe dominated by some intention, and they accomplish their aim with a\ncertainty that cannot be generally credited to conscious arbitrary\nmotions. In both characteristics, the force as well as the sure aim,\nthey show besides a resemblance to the motor manifestations of the\nhysterical neurosis, and in part also to the motor accomplishments of\nsomnambulism, which here as well as there point to the same unfamiliar\nmodification of the functions of innervation.\nIn latter years, since I have been collecting such observations, it\nhas happened several times that I have shattered and broken objects of\nsome value, but the examination of these cases convinced me that it\nwas never the result of accident or of my unintentional awkwardness.\nThus, one morning while in my bath-robe and straw slippers I followed a\nsudden impulse as I passed a room, and hurled a slipper from my foot\nagainst the wall so that it brought down a beautiful little marble\nVenus from its bracket. As it fell to pieces I recited quite unmoved\nthe following verse from Busch:--\n\u201cAch! Die Venus ist perd\u00fc--[47]\nKlickeradoms!--von Medici!\u201d\nThis crazy action and my calmness at the sight of the damage is\nexplained in the then existing situation. We had a very sick person in\nthe family, of whose recovery I had personally despaired. That morning\nI had been informed that there was a great improvement; I know that I\nhad said to myself, \u201cAfter all she will live.\u201d My attack of destructive\nmadness served therefore as the expression of a grateful feeling\ntoward fate, and afforded me the opportunity of performing an \u201cact\nof sacrifice,\u201d just as if I had vowed, \u201cIf she gets well I will give\nthis or that as a sacrifice.\u201d That I chose the Venus of Medici as this\nsacrifice was only gallant homage to the convalescent. But even to-day\nit is still incomprehensible to me that I decided so quickly, aimed so\naccurately, and struck no other object in close proximity.\nAnother breaking, in which I utilized a pen-holder falling from\nmy hand, also signified a sacrifice, but this time it was a pious\noffering to avert some evil. I had once allowed myself to reproach a\ntrue and worthy friend for no other reason than certain manifestations\nwhich I interpreted from his unconscious activity. He took it amiss\nand wrote me a letter in which he bade me not to treat my friends by\npsychoanalysis. I had to admit that he was right and appeased him\nwith my answer. While writing this letter I had before me my latest\nacquisition--a small, handsome glazed Egyptian figure. I broke it in\nthe manner mentioned, and then immediately knew that I had caused this\nmischief to avert a greater one. Luckily, both the friendship and the\nfigure could be so cemented that the break would not be noticed.\nA third case of breaking had a less serious connection; it was only a\ndisguised \u201cexecution,\u201d to use an expression from Th. Vischer\u2019s _Auch\nEiner_, of an object that no longer suited my taste. For quite a while\nI had carried a cane with a silver handle; through no fault of mine the\nthin silver plate was once damaged and poorly repaired. Soon after the\ncane was returned I mirthfully used the handle to angle for the leg of\none of my children. In that way it naturally broke, and I got rid of it.\nThe indifference with which we accept the resulting damage in all\nthese cases may certainly be taken as evidence for the existence of an\nunconscious purpose in their execution.\n(_e_) As can sometimes be demonstrated by analysis, the dropping of\nobjects or the overturning and breaking of the same are very frequently\nutilized as the expression of unconscious streams of thought, but more\noften they serve to represent the superstitious or odd significances\nconnected therewith in popular sayings. The meanings attached to the\nspilling of salt, the overturning of a wineglass, the sticking of a\nknife dropped to the floor, and so on, are well known. I shall discuss\nlater the right to investigate such superstitious interpretations;\nhere I shall simply observe that the individual awkward acts do not\nby any means always have the same meaning, but, depending on the\ncircumstances, they serve to represent now this or that purpose.\nRecently we passed through a period in my house during which an\nunusual number of glass and china dishes were broken. I myself largely\ncontributed to this damage. This little endemic was readily explained\nby the fact that it preceded the public betrothal of my eldest\ndaughter. On such festivities it is customary to break some dishes and\nutter at the same time some felicitating expression. This custom may\nsignify a sacrifice or express any other symbolic sense.\nWhen servants destroy fragile objects through dropping them, we\ncertainly do not think in the first place of a psychologic motive for\nit; still, some obscure motives are not improbable even here. Nothing\nlies farther from the uneducated than the appreciation of art and works\nof art. Our servants are dominated by a foolish hostility against these\nproductions, especially when the objects, whose worth they do not\nrealize, become a source of a great deal of work for them. On the other\nhand, persons of the same education and origin employed in scientific\ninstitutions often distinguish themselves by great dexterity and\nreliability in the handling of delicate objects, as soon as they begin\nto identify themselves with their masters and consider themselves an\nessential part of the staff.\nI shall here add the report of a young mechanical engineer, which gives\nsome insight into the mechanism of damaging things.\n\u201cSome time ago I worked with many others in the laboratory of the\nHigh School on a series of complicated experiments on the subject of\nelasticity. It was a work that we undertook of our own volition, but it\nturned out that it took up more of our time than we expected. One day,\nwhile going to the laboratory with F., he complained of losing so much\ntime, especially on this day, when he had so many other things to do at\nhome. I could only agree with him, and he added half jokingly, alluding\nto an incident of the previous week: \u2018Let us hope that the machine will\nrefuse to work, so that we can interrupt the experiment and go home\nearlier.\u2019\n\u201cIn arranging the work, it happened that F. was assigned to the\nregulation of the pressure valve, that is, it was his duty to carefully\nopen the valve and let the fluid under pressure flow from the\naccumulator into the cylinder of the hydraulic press. The leader of\nthe experiment stood at the manometer and called a loud \u2018Stop!\u2019 when\nthe maximum pressure was reached. At this command F. grasped the valve\nand turned it with all his force--to the left (all valves, without\nany exception, are closed to the right). This caused a sudden full\npressure in the accumulator of the press, and as there was no outlet,\nthe connecting pipe burst. This was quite a trifling accident to the\nmachine, but enough to force us to stop our work for the day and go\nhome.\n\u201cIt is characteristic, moreover, that some time later, on discussing\nthis occurrence, my friend F. could not recall the remark that I\npositively remember his having made.\u201d\nSimilarly, to fall, to make a misstep, or to slip need not always be\ninterpreted as an entirely accidental miscarriage of a motor action.\nThe linguistic double meaning of these expressions points to diverse\nhidden fantasies, which may present themselves through the giving up\nof bodily equilibrium. I recall a number of lighter nervous ailments\nin women and girls which made their appearance after falling without\ninjury, and which were conceived as traumatic hysteria as a result\nof the shock of the fall. At that time I already entertained the\nimpression that these conditions had a different connection, that the\nfall was already a preparation of the neurosis, and an expression of\nthe same unconscious fantasies of sexual content which may be taken as\nthe moving forces behind the symptoms. Was not this very thing meant in\nthe proverb which says, \u201cWhen a maiden falls, she falls on her back?\u201d\nWe can also add to these mistakes the case of one who gives a beggar a\ngold piece in place of a copper or a silver coin. The solution of such\nmishandling is simple: it is an act of sacrifice designed to mollify\nfate, to avert evil, and so on. If we hear a tender mother or aunt\nexpress concern regarding the health of a child, directly before taking\na walk during which she displays her charity, contrary to her usual\nhabit, we can no longer doubt the sense of this apparently undesirable\naccident. In this manner our faulty acts make possible the practice of\nall those pious and superstitious customs which must shun the light of\nconsciousness, because of the strivings against them of our unbelieving\nreason.\n(_f_) That accidental actions are really intentional will find no\ngreater credence in any other sphere than in sexual activity, where the\nborder between the intention and accident hardly seems discernible.\nThat an apparently clumsy movement may be utilized in a most refined\nway for sexual purposes I can verify by a nice example from my own\nexperience. In a friend\u2019s house I met a young girl visitor who excited\nin me a feeling of fondness which I had long believed extinct, thus\nputting me in a jovial, loquacious, and complaisant mood. At that time\nI endeavoured to find out how this came about, as a year before this\nsame girl made no impression on me.\nAs the girl\u2019s uncle, a very old man, entered the room, we both jumped\nto our feet to bring him a chair which stood in the corner. She was\nmore agile than I and also nearer the object, so that she was the\nfirst to take possession of the chair. She carried it with its back to\nher, holding both hands on the edge of the seat. As I got there later\nand did not give up the claim to carrying the chair, I suddenly stood\ndirectly back of her, and with both my arms was embracing her from\nbehind, and for a moment my hands touched her lap. I naturally solved\nthe situation as quickly as it came about. Nor did it occur to anybody\nhow dexterously I had taken advantage of this awkward movement.\nOccasionally I have had to admit to myself that the annoying, awkward\nstepping aside on the street, whereby for some seconds one steps\nhere and there, yet always in the same direction as the other person,\nuntil finally both stop facing each other, that this \u201cbarring one\u2019s\nway\u201d repeats an ill-mannered, provoking conduct of earlier times\nand conceals erotic purposes under the mask of awkwardness. From my\npsychoanalysis of neurotics I know that the so-called na\u00efvet\u00e9 of young\npeople and children is frequently only such a mask, employed in order\nthat the subject may say or do the indecent without restraint.\nW. Stekel has reported similar observations in regard to himself: \u201cI\nentered a house and offered my right hand to the hostess. In a most\nremarkable way I thereby loosened the bow which held together her loose\nmorning-gown. I was conscious of no dishonourable intent, still I\nexecuted this awkward movement with the agility of a juggler.\u201d\n(_g_) The effects which result from mistakes of normal persons are, as\na rule, of a most harmless nature. Just for this reason it would be\nparticularly interesting to find out whether mistakes of considerable\nimportance, which could be followed by serious results, as, for\nexample, those of physicians or druggists, fall within the range of our\npoint of view.\nAs I am seldom in a position to deal with active medical matters, I\ncan only report one mistake from my own experience. I treated a very\nold woman, whom I visited twice daily for several years. My medical\nactivities were limited to two acts, which I performed during my\nmorning visits: I dropped a few drops of an eye lotion into her eyes\nand gave her a hypodermic injection of morphine. I prepared regularly\ntwo bottles--a blue one, containing the eye lotion, and a white one,\ncontaining the morphine solution. While performing these duties my\nthoughts were mostly occupied with something else, for they had been\nrepeated so often that the attention acted as if free. One morning I\nnoticed that the automaton worked wrong; I had put the dropper into the\nwhite instead of into the blue bottle, and had dropped into the eyes\nthe morphine instead of the lotion. I was greatly frightened, but then\ncalmed myself through the reflection that a few drops of a _two per\ncent_. solution of morphine would not likely do any harm even if left\nin the conjunctival sac. The cause of the fright manifestly belonged\nelsewhere.\nIn attempting to analyse the slight mistake I first thought of the\nphrase, \u201cto seize the old woman by mistake,\u201d which pointed out the\nshort way to the solution. I had been impressed by a dream which a\nyoung man had told me the previous evening, the contents of which could\nbe explained only on the basis of sexual intercourse with his own\nmother.[48] The strangeness of the fact that the \u0152dipus legend takes\nno offence at the age of Queen Jocasta seemed to me to agree with the\nassumption that in being in love with one\u2019s mother we never deal with\nthe present personality, but with her youthful memory picture carried\nover from our childhood. Such incongruities always show themselves\nwhere one fantasy fluctuating between two periods is made conscious,\nand is then bound to one definite period.\nDeep in thoughts of this kind, I came to my patient of over ninety;\nI must have been well on the way to grasp the universal character\nof the \u0152dipus fable as the correlation of the fate which the oracle\npronounces, for I made a blunder in reference to or on the old woman.\nHere, again, the mistake was harmless; of the two possible errors,\ntaking the morphine solution for the eye, or the eye lotion for the\ninjection, I chose the one by far the least harmful. The question still\nremains open whether in mistakes in handling things which may cause\nserious harm we can assume an unconscious intention as in the cases\nhere discussed.\nThe following case from Brill\u2019s experience corroborates the assumption\nthat even serious mistakes are determined by unconscious intentions:\n\u201cA physician received a telegram informing him that his aged uncle was\nvery sick. In spite of important family affairs at home he at once\nrepaired to that distant town because his uncle was really his father,\nwho had cared for him since he was one and a half years old, when his\nown father had died. On reaching there he found his uncle suffering\nfrom pneumonia, and, as the old man was an octogenarian, the doctors\nheld out no hope for his recovery. \u2018It was simply a question of a day\nor two,\u2019 was the local doctor\u2019s verdict. Although a prominent physician\nin a big city, he refused to co-operate in the treatment, as he found\nthat the case was properly managed by the local doctor, and he could\nnot suggest anything to improve matters.\n\u201cSince death was daily expected, he decided to remain to the end. He\nwaited a few days, but the sick man struggled hard, and although there\nwas no question of any recovery, because of the many new complications\nwhich had arisen, death seemed to be deferred for a while. One night\nbefore retiring he went into the sick-room and took his uncle\u2019s pulse.\nAs it was quite weak, he decided not to wait for the doctor, and\nadministered a hypodermic injection. The patient grew rapidly worse\nand died within a few hours. There was something strange in the last\nsymptoms, and on later attempting to replace the tube of hypodermic\ntablets into the case, he found to his consternation that he had taken\nout the wrong tube, and instead of a small dose of digitalis he had\ngiven a large dose of hyoscine.\n\u201cThis case was related to me by the doctor after he read my paper on\nthe \u0152dipus Complex.[49] We agreed that this mistake was determined not\nonly by his impatience to get home to his sick child, but also by an\nold resentment and unconscious hostility toward his uncle (father).\u201d\nIt is known that in the more serious cases of psychoneuroses one\nsometimes finds self-mutilations as symptoms of the disease. That the\npsychic conflict may end in suicide can never be excluded in these\ncases. Thus I know from experience, which some day I shall support\nwith convincing examples, that many apparently accidental injuries\nhappening to such patients are really self-inflicted. This is brought\nabout by the fact that there is a constantly lurking tendency to\nself-punishment, usually expressing itself in self-reproach, or\ncontributing to the formation of a symptom, which skilfully makes\nuse of an external situation. The required external situation may\naccidentally present itself or the punishment tendency may assist it\nuntil the way is open for the desired injurious effect.\nSuch occurrences are by no means rare even in cases of moderate\nseverity, and they betray the portion of unconscious intention through\na series of special features--for example, through the striking\npresence of mind which the patients show in the pretended accidents.[50]\nI will report exhaustively one in place of many such examples from\nmy professional experience. A young woman broke her leg below the\nknee in a carriage accident so that she was bedridden for weeks. The\nstriking part of it was the lack of any manifestation of pain and the\ncalmness with which she bore her misfortune. This calamity ushered in\na long and serious neurotic illness, from which she was finally cured\nby psychotherapy. During the treatment I discovered the circumstances\nsurrounding the accident, as well as certain impressions which preceded\nit. The young woman with her jealous husband spent some time on\nthe farm of her married sister, in company with her numerous other\nbrothers and sisters with their wives and husbands. One evening she\ngave an exhibition of one of her talents before this intimate circle;\nshe danced artistically the \u201ccancan,\u201d to the great delight of her\nrelatives, but to the great annoyance of her husband, who afterward\nwhispered to her, \u201cAgain you have behaved like a prostitute.\u201d The words\ntook effect; we will leave it undecided whether it was just on account\nof the dance. That night she was restless in her sleep, and the next\nforenoon she decided to go out driving. She chose the horses herself,\nrefusing one team and demanding another. Her youngest sister wished\nto have her baby with its nurse accompany her, but she opposed this\nvehemently. During the drive she was nervous; she reminded the coachman\nthat the horses were getting skittish, and as the fidgety animals\nreally produced a momentary difficulty she jumped from the carriage\nin fright and broke her leg, while those remaining in the carriage\nwere uninjured. Although after the disclosure of these details we can\nhardly doubt that this accident was really contrived, we cannot fail\nto admire the skill which forced the accident to mete out a punishment\nso suitable to the crime. For as it happened \u201ccancan\u201d dancing with her\nbecame impossible for a long time.\nConcerning self-inflicted injuries of my own experience, I cannot\nreport anything in calm times, but under extraordinary conditions I do\nnot believe myself incapable of such acts. When a member of my family\ncomplains that he or she has bitten his tongue, bruised her finger,\nand so on, instead of the expected sympathy I put the question, \u201cWhy\ndid you do that?\u201d But I have most painfully squeezed my thumb, after a\nyouthful patient acquainted me during the treatment with his intention\n(naturally not to be taken seriously) of marrying my eldest daughter,\nwhile I knew that she was then in a private hospital in extreme danger\nof losing her life.\nOne of my boys, whose vivacious temperament was wont to put\ndifficulties in the management of nursing him in his illness, had a fit\nof anger one morning because he was ordered to remain in bed during the\nforenoon, and threatened to kill himself: a way out suggested to him\nby the newspapers. In the evening he showed me a swelling on the side\nof his chest which was the result of bumping against the door knob.\nTo my ironical question why he did it, and what he meant by it, the\neleven-year-old child explained, \u201cThat was my attempt at suicide which\nI threatened this morning.\u201d However, I do not believe that my views on\nself-inflicted wounds were accessible to my children at that time.\nWhoever believes in the occurrence of semi-intentional self-inflicted\ninjury--if this awkward expression be permitted--will become prepared\nto accept through it the fact that aside from conscious intentional\nsuicide there also exists semi-intentional annihilation--with\nunconscious intention--which is capable of aptly utilizing a threat\nagainst life and masking it as a casual mishap. Such mechanism is by no\nmeans rare. For the tendency to self-destruction exists to a certain\ndegree in many more persons than in those who bring it to completion.\nSelf-inflicted injuries are, as a rule, a compromise between this\nimpulse and the forces working against it, and even where it really\ncomes to suicide the inclination has existed for a long time with less\nstrength or as an unconscious and repressed tendency.\nEven suicide consciously committed chooses its time, means, and\nopportunity; it is quite natural that unconscious suicide should wait\nfor a motive to take upon itself one part of the causation and thus\nfree it from its oppression by taking up the defensive forces of the\nperson.[51] These are in no way idle discussions which I here bring\nup; more than one case of apparently accidental misfortune (on a\nhorse or out of a carriage) has become known to me whose surrounding\ncircumstances justified the suspicion of suicide.\nFor example, during an officers\u2019 horse-race one of the riders fell\nfrom his horse and was so seriously injured that a few days later he\nsuccumbed to his injuries. His behaviour after regaining consciousness\nwas remarkable in more than one way, and his conduct previous to the\naccident was still more remarkable. He had been greatly depressed by\nthe death of his beloved mother, had crying spells in the society of\nhis comrades, and to his trusted friend had spoken of the _t\u00e6dium\nvit\u00e6_. He had wished to quit the service in order to take part in a\nwar in Africa which had no interest for him.[52] Formerly a keen\nrider, he had later evaded riding whenever possible. Finally, before\nthe horse-race, from which he could not withdraw, he expressed a sad\nforeboding, which most expectedly in the light of our conception came\ntrue. It may be contended that it is quite comprehensible without any\nfurther cause that a person in such a state of nervous depression\ncannot manage a horse as well as on normal days. I quite agree with\nthat, only I should like to look for the mechanism of this motor\ninhibition through \u201cnervousness\u201d in the intention of self-destruction\nhere emphasized.\nDr. Ferenczi has left to me for publication the analysis of an\napparently accidental injury by shooting which he explained as an\nunconscious attempt at suicide. I can only agree with his deduction:--\n\u201cJ. Ad., 22 years old, carpenter, visited me on the 18th of January,\n1908. He wished to know whether the bullet which pierced his left\ntemple March 20, 1907, could or should be removed by operation. Aside\nfrom occasional, not very severe, headaches, he felt quite well, also\nthe objective examination showed nothing besides the characteristic\npowder wound on the left temple, so that I advised against an\noperation. When questioned concerning the circumstances of the case he\nasserted that he injured himself accidentally. He was playing with his\nbrother\u2019s revolver, and _believing that it was not loaded_ he pressed\nit with his left hand against the left temple (he is not left-handed),\nput his finger on the trigger, and the shot went off. _There were three\nbullets in the six-shooter._\n\u201cI asked him how he came to carry the revolver, and he answered that it\nwas at the time of his army conscription, that he took it to the inn\nthe evening before because he feared fights. At the army examination\nhe was considered unfit for service on account of varicose veins,\nwhich caused him much mortification. He went home and played with the\nrevolver. He had no intention of hurting himself, but the accident\noccurred. On further questioning whether he was otherwise satisfied\nwith his fortune, he answered with a sigh, and related a love affair\nwith a girl who loved him in return, but nevertheless left him. She\nemigrated to America out of sheer avariciousness. He wanted to follow\nher, but his parents prevented him. His lady-love left on the 20th of\nJanuary, 1907, just two months before the accident.\n\u201cDespite all these suspicious elements the patient insisted that the\nshot was an \u2018accident.\u2019 I was firmly convinced, however, that the\nneglect to find out whether the revolver was loaded before he began to\nplay with it, as well as the self-inflicted injury, were psychically\ndetermined. He was still under the depressing effects of the unhappy\nlove affair, and apparently wanted \u2018to forget everything\u2019 in the army.\nWhen this hope, too, was taken away from him he resorted to playing\nwith the weapon--that is, to an unconscious attempt at suicide. The\nfact that he did not hold the revolver in the right but in the left\nhand speaks conclusively in favour of the fact that he was really only\n\u2018playing\u2019--that is, he did not wish consciously to commit suicide.\u201d\nAnother analysis of an apparently accidental self-inflicted wound,\ndetailed to me by an observer, recalls the saying, \u201cHe who digs a pit\nfor others falls in himself.\u201d[53]\n\u201cMrs. X., belonging to a good middle-class family, is married and has\nthree children. She is somewhat nervous, but never needed any strenuous\ntreatment, as she could sufficiently adapt herself to life. One day she\nsustained a rather striking though transitory disfigurement of her face\nin the following manner: She stumbled in a street that was in process\nof repair and struck her face against the house wall. The whole face\nwas bruised, the eyelids blue and \u0153dematous, and as she feared that\nsomething might happen to her eyes she sent for the doctor. After she\nwas calmed I asked her, \u2018But why did you fall in such a manner?\u2019 She\nanswered that just before this accident she warned her husband, who\nhad been suffering for some months from a joint affection, to be very\ncareful in the street, and she often had the experience that in some\nremarkable way those things occurred to her against which she warned\nothers.\n\u201cI was not satisfied with this as the determination of her accident,\nand asked her whether she had not something else to tell me. \u2018Yes, just\nbefore the accident she noticed a nice picture in a shop on the other\nside of the street, which she suddenly desired as an ornament for her\nnursery, and wished to buy it at once. She thereupon walked across to\nthe shop without looking at the street, stumbled over a heap of stones,\nand fell with her face against the wall without making the slightest\neffort to shield herself with her hands. The intention to buy the\npicture was immediately forgotten, and she walked home in haste.\u2019\n\u201c\u2018But why were you not more careful?\u2019 I asked.\n\u201c\u2018Oh!\u2019 she answered, \u2018perhaps it was only a punishment for that episode\nwhich I confided to you!\u2019\n\u201c\u2018Has this episode still bothered you?\u2019\n\u201c\u2018Yes, later I regretted it very much; I considered myself wicked,\ncriminal, and immoral, but at the time I was almost crazy with\nnervousness.\u2019\n\u201cShe referred to an abortion which was started by a quack and had to be\nbrought to completion by a gynecologist. This abortion was initiated\nwith the consent of her husband, as both wished, on account of their\npecuniary circumstances, to be spared from being additionally blessed\nwith children.\n\u201cShe said: \u2018I had often reproached myself with the words, \u201cYou really\nhad your child killed,\u201d and I feared that such a crime could not\nremain unpunished. Now that you have assured me that there is nothing\nseriously wrong with my eyes I am quite assured I have already been\nsufficiently punished.\u2019\n\u201cThis accident, therefore, was, on the one hand, a retribution for\nher sin, but, on the other hand, it may have served as an escape from\na more dire punishment which she had feared for many months. In the\nmoment that she ran to the shop to buy the picture the memory of this\nwhole history, with its fears (already quite active in her unconscious\nat the time she warned her husband), became overwhelming and could\nperhaps find expression in words like these: \u2018But why do you want an\nornament for the nursery?--you who had your child killed! You are a\nmurderer! The great punishment is surely approaching!\u2019\n\u201cThis thought did not become conscious, but instead of it she made use\nof the situation--I might say of the psychologic moment--to utilize\nin a commonplace manner the heap of stones to inflict upon herself\nthis punishment. It was for this reason that she did not even attempt\nto put out her arms while falling and was not much frightened. The\nsecond, and probably lesser, determinant of her accident was obviously\nthe self-punishment for her unconscious wish to be rid of her husband,\nwho was an accessory to the crime in this affair. This was betrayed by\nher absolutely superfluous warning to be very careful in the street on\naccount of the stones. For, just because her husband had a weak leg, he\nwas very careful in walking.\u201d\nIf such a rage against one\u2019s own integrity and one\u2019s own life\ncan be hidden behind apparently accidental awkwardness and motor\ninsufficiency, then it is not a big step forward to grasp the\npossibility of transferring the same conception to mistakes which\nseriously endanger the life and health of others. What I can put\nforward as evidence for the validity of this conception was taken\nfrom my experience with neurotics, and hence does not fully meet the\ndemands of this situation. I will report a case in which it was not\nan erroneously carried-out action, but what may be more aptly termed\na symbolic or chance action that gave me the clue which later made\npossible the solution of the patient\u2019s conflict.\nI once undertook to improve the marriage relations of a very\nintelligent man, whose differences with his tenderly attached young\nwife could surely be traced to real causes, but as he himself admitted\ncould not be altogether explained through them. He continually occupied\nhimself with the thought of a separation, which he repeatedly rejected\nbecause he dearly loved his two small children. In spite of this he\nalways returned to that resolution and sought no means to make the\nsituation bearable to himself. Such an unsettlement of a conflict\nserved to prove to me that there were unconscious and repressed\nmotives which enforced the conflicting conscious thoughts, and in such\ncases I always undertake to end the conflict by psychic analysis. One\nday the man related to me a slight occurrence which had extremely\nfrightened him. He was sporting with the older child, by far his\nfavourite. He tossed it high in the air and repeated this tossing till\nfinally he thrust it so high that its head almost struck the massive\ngas chandelier. Almost, but not quite, or say \u201cjust about!\u201d Nothing\nhappened to the child except that it became dizzy from fright. The\nfather stood transfixed with the child in his arms, while the mother\nmerged into an hysterical attack. The particular facility of this\ncareless movement, with the violent reaction in the parents, suggested\nto me to look upon this accident as a symbolic action which gave\nexpression to an evil intention toward the beloved child.\nI could remove the contradiction of the actual tenderness of this\nfather for his child by referring the impulse to injure it to the\ntime when it was the only one, and so small that as yet the father\nhad no occasion for tender interest in it. Then it was easy to assume\nthat this man, so little pleased with his wife at that time, might\nhave thought: \u201cIf this small being for whom I have no regard whatever\nshould die, I would be free and could separate from my wife.\u201d The wish\nfor the death of this much loved being must therefore have continued\nunconsciously. From here it was easy to find the way to the unconscious\nfixation of this wish.\nThere was indeed a powerful determinant in a memory from the patient\u2019s\nchildhood: it referred to the death of a little brother, which the\nmother laid to his father\u2019s negligence, and which led to serious\nquarrels with threats of separation between the parents. The continued\ncourse of my patient\u2019s life, as well as the therapeutic success\nconfirmed my analysis.\nIX\nSYMPTOMATIC AND CHANCE ACTIONS\nThe actions described so far, in which we recognize the execution of\nan unconscious intention, appeared as disturbances of other unintended\nactions, and hid themselves under the pretext of awkwardness. Chance\nactions, which we shall now discuss, differ from erroneously carried\nout actions only in that they disdain the support of a conscious\nintention and really need no pretext. They appear independently and\nare accepted because one does not credit them with any aim or purpose.\nWe execute them \u201cwithout thinking anything of them,\u201d \u201cby mere chance,\u201d\n\u201cjust to keep the hands busy,\u201d and we feel confident that such\ninformation will be quite sufficient should one inquire as to their\nsignificance. In order to enjoy the advantage of this exceptional\nposition these actions which no longer claim awkwardness as an excuse\nmust fulfil certain conditions: they must not be striking, and their\neffects must be insignificant.\nI have collected a large number of such \u201cchance actions\u201d from myself\nand others, and after thoroughly investigating the individual\nexamples, I believe that the name \u201csymptomatic actions\u201d is more\nsuitable. They give expression to something which the actor himself\ndoes not suspect in them, and which as a rule he has no intention\nof imparting to others, but aims to keep to himself. Like the other\nphenomena considered so far, they thus play the part of symptoms.\nThe richest output of such chance or symptomatic actions is above all\nobtained in the psychoanalytic treatment of neurotics. I cannot deny\nmyself the pleasure of showing by two examples of this nature how\nfar and how delicately the determination of these plain occurrences\nare swayed by unconscious thoughts. The line of demarcation between\nthe symptomatic actions and the erroneously carried out actions is\nso indefinite that I could have disposed of these examples in the\npreceding chapter.\n(_a_) During the analysis a young woman reproduced this idea which\nsuddenly occurred to her. Yesterday while cutting her nails \u201cshe had\ncut into the flesh while engaged in trimming the cuticle.\u201d This is\nof so little interest that we ask in astonishment why it is at all\nremembered and mentioned, and therefore come to the conclusion that\nwe deal with a symptomatic action. It was really the finger upon\nwhich the wedding-ring is worn which was injured through this slight\nawkwardness. It happened, moreover, on her wedding-day, which thus\ngives to the injury of the delicate skin a very definite and easily\nguessed meaning. At the same time she also related a dream which\nalluded to the awkwardness of her husband and her anesthesia as a\nwoman. But why did she injure the ring finger of her left hand when the\nwedding-ring is worn on the right? Her husband is a jurist, a \u201cDoctor\nof Laws\u201d (_Doktor der Rechte_, literally a Doctor of Rights), and her\nsecret affection as a girl belonged to a physician who was jokingly\ncalled _Doktor der Linke_ (literally Doctor of Left). Incidentally a\nleft-handed marriage has a definite meaning.\n(_b_) A single young woman relates: \u201cYesterday, quite unintentionally,\nI tore a hundred-dollar note in two pieces and gave half to a woman\nwho was visiting me. Is that, too, a symptomatic action?\u201d After\ncloser investigation the matter of the hundred-dollar note elicited\nthe following associations: She dedicated a part of her time and\nher fortune to charitable work. Together with another woman she was\ntaking care of the rearing of an orphan. The hundred dollars was the\ncontribution sent her by that woman, which she enclosed in an envelope\nand provisionally deposited on her writing-desk.\nThe visitor was a prominent woman with whom she was associated in\nanother act of charity. This woman wished to note the names of a\nnumber of persons to whom she could apply for charitable aid. There was\nno paper, so my patient grasped the envelope from her desk, and without\nthinking of its contents tore it in two pieces, one of which she kept,\nin order to have a duplicate list of names, and gave the other to her\nvisitor.\nNote the harmlessness of this aimless occurrence. It is known that a\nhundred-dollar note suffers no loss in value when it is torn, provided\nall the pieces are produced. That the woman would not throw away the\npiece of paper was assumed by the importance of the names on it, and\nthere was just as little doubt that she would return the valuable\ncontent as soon as she noticed it.\nBut to what unconscious thought should this chance action, which was\nmade possible through forgetfulness, give expression? The visitor in\nthis case had a very definite relation to my patient and myself. It was\nshe who at one time had recommended me as physician to the suffering\ngirl, and if I am not mistaken my patient considered herself indebted\nfor this advice. Should this halved hundred-dollar note perhaps\nrepresent a fee for her mediation? That still remained enigmatic.\nBut other material was added to this beginning. Several days before a\nwoman mediator of a different sort had inquired of a relative whether\nthe gracious young lady wished to make the acquaintance of a certain\ngentleman, and that morning, some hours before the woman\u2019s visit, the\nwooing letter of the suitor arrived, giving occasion for much mirth.\nWhen therefore the visitor opened the conversation with inquiries\nregarding the health of my patient, the latter could well have thought:\n\u201cYou certainly found me the right doctor, but if you could assist me\nin obtaining the right husband (and a child) I should be still more\ngrateful.\u201d\nBoth mediators became fused into one in this repressed thought, and\nshe handed the visitor the fee which her fantasy was ready to give the\nother. This resolution became perfectly convincing when I add that I\nhad told her of such chance or symptomatic actions only the previous\nevening. She then took advantage of the next occasion to produce an\nanalogous action.\nWe can undertake a grouping of these extremely frequent chance and\nsymptomatic actions according to their occurrence as habitual, regular\nunder certain circumstances, and as isolated ones. The first group\n(such as playing with the watch-chain, fingering one\u2019s beard, and\nso on), which can almost serve as a characteristic of the person\nconcerned, is related to the numerous tic movements, and certainly\ndeserves to be dealt with in connection with the latter. In the second\ngroup I place the playing with one\u2019s cane, the scribbling with one\u2019s\npencil, the jingling of coins in one\u2019s pocket, kneading dough and other\nplastic materials, all sorts of handling of one\u2019s clothing, and many\nother actions of the same order.\nThese playful occupations during psychic treatment regularly conceal\nsense and meaning to which other expression is denied. Generally the\nperson in question knows nothing about it; he is unaware whether he is\ndoing the same thing or whether he has imitated certain modifications\nin his customary playing, and he also fails to see or hear the\neffects of these actions. For example, he does not hear the noise\nwhich is produced by the jingling of coins, and he is astonished and\nincredulous when his attention is called to it. Of equal significance\nto the physician, and worthy of his observation, is everything that\none does with his clothing often without noticing it. Every change in\nthe customary attire, every little negligence, such as an unfastened\nbutton, every trace of exposure means to express something that the\nwearer of the apparel does not wish to say directly, usually he is\nentirely unconscious of it.\nThe interpretation of these trifling chance actions, as well as the\nproof for their interpretation, can be demonstrated every time with\nsufficient certainty from the surrounding circumstances during the\ntreatment, from the themes under discussion, and from the ideas that\ncome to the surface when attention is directed to the seeming accident.\nBecause of this connection I will refrain from supporting my assertions\nby reporting examples with their analyses; but I mention these matters\nbecause I believe that they have the same meaning in normal persons as\nin my patients.\nI cannot, however, refrain from showing by at least one example how\nclosely an habitually accomplished symbolic action may be connected\nwith the most intimate and important part of the life of a normal\nindividual.[54]\n\u201cAs Professor Freud has taught us, the symbolism in the infantile life\nof the normal plays a greater r\u00f4le than was expected from earlier\npsychoanalytic experiences. In view of this the following brief\nanalysis may be of general interest, especially on account of its\nmedical aspects.\n\u201cA doctor on rearranging his furniture in a new house came across a\nstraight, wooden stethoscope, and, after pausing to decide where he\nshould put it, was impelled to place it on the side of his writing-desk\nin such a position that it stood exactly between his chair and the\none reserved for his patients. The act in itself was certainly odd,\nfor in the first place the straight stethoscope served no purpose,\nas he invariably used a binaural one; and in the second place all his\nmedical apparatus and instruments were always kept in drawers, with the\nsole exception of this one. However, he gave no thought to the matter\nuntil one day it was brought to his notice by a patient who had never\nseen a wooden stethoscope, asking him what it was. On being told, she\nasked why he kept it there. He answered in an offhand way that that\nplace was as good as any other. This, however, started him thinking,\nand he wondered whether there had been an unconscious motive in his\naction. Being interested in the psychoanalytic method, he asked me to\ninvestigate the matter.\n\u201cThe first memory that occurred to him was the fact that when a medical\nstudent he had been struck by the habit his hospital interne had of\nalways carrying in his hand a wooden stethoscope on his ward visits,\nalthough he never used it. He greatly admired this interne, and was\nmuch attached to him. Later on, when he himself became an interne he\ncontracted the same habit, and would feel very uncomfortable if by\nmistake he left the room without having the instrument to swing in his\nhand. The aimlessness of the habit was shown, not only by the fact\nthat the only stethoscope he ever used was a binaural one, which he\ncarried in his pocket, but also in that it was continued when he was a\nsurgical interne and never needed any stethoscope at all.\n\u201cFrom this it was evident that the idea of the instrument in question\nhad in some way or other become invested with a greater psychic\nsignificance than normally belongs to it--in other words, that to the\nsubject it stood for more than it does for other people. The idea\nmust have got unconsciously associated with some other one, which\nit symbolized, and from which it derived its additional fulness of\nmeaning. I will forestall the rest of the analysis by saying what\nthis secondary idea was--namely, a phallic one; the way in which this\ncurious association had been formed will presently be related. The\ndiscomfort he experienced in hospital on missing the instrument, and\nthe relief and assurance the presence of it gave him, was related to\nwhat is known as a \u2018castration-complex\u2019--namely, a childhood fear,\noften continued in a disguised form into adult life, lest a private\npart of his body should be taken away from him, just as playthings so\noften were. The fear was due to paternal threats that it would be cut\noff if he were not a good boy, particularly in a certain direction.\nThis is a very common complex, and accounts for a great deal of general\nnervousness and lack of confidence in later years.\n\u201cThen came a number of childhood memories relating to his family\ndoctor. He had been strongly attached to this doctor as a child, and\nduring the analysis long-buried memories were recovered of a double\nphantasy he had in his fourth year concerning the birth of a younger\nsister--namely, that she was the child (1) of himself and his mother,\nthe father being relegated to the background, and (2) of the doctor and\nhimself; in this he thus played both a masculine and feminine part.[55]\nAt the time, when his curiosity was being aroused by the event, he\ncould not help noticing the prominent share taken by the doctor in the\nproceedings, and the subordinate position occupied by the father: the\nsignificance of this for his later life will presently be pointed out.\n\u201cThe stethoscope association was formed through many connections.\nIn the first place, the physical appearance of the instrument--a\nstraight, rigid, hollow tube, having a small bulbous summit at one\nextremity and a broad base at the other--and the fact of its being\nthe essential part of the medical paraphernalia, the instrument with\nwhich the doctor performed his magical and interesting feats, were\nmatters that attracted his boyish attention. He had had his chest\nrepeatedly examined by the doctor at the age of six, and distinctly\nrecollected the voluptuous sensation of feeling the latter\u2019s head\nnear him pressing the wooden stethoscope into his chest, and of the\nrhythmic to-and-fro respiratory movement. He had been struck by the\ndoctor\u2019s habit of carrying his stethoscope inside his hat; he found it\ninteresting that the doctor should carry his chief instrument concealed\nabout his person, always handy when he went to see patients, and that\nhe only had to take off his hat (_i.e_., a part of his clothing) and\n\u2018pull it out.\u2019 At the age of eight he was impressed by being told by\nan older boy that it was the doctor\u2019s custom to get into bed with\nhis women patients. It is certain that the doctor, who was young and\nhandsome, was extremely popular among the women of the neighbourhood,\nincluding the subject\u2019s own mother. The doctor and his \u2018instrument\u2019\nwere therefore the objects of great interest throughout his boyhood.\n\u201cIt is probable that, as in many other cases, unconscious\nidentification with the family doctor had been a main motive in\ndetermining the subject\u2019s choice of profession. It was here doubly\nconditioned (1) by the superiority of the doctor on certain interesting\noccasions to the father, of whom the subject was very jealous, and (2)\nby the doctor\u2019s knowledge of forbidden topics[56] and his opportunity\nfor illicit indulgence. The subject admitted that he had on several\noccasions experienced erotic temptations in regard to his women\npatients; he had twice fallen in love with one, and finally had married\none.\n\u201cThe next memory was of a dream, plainly of a homosexual-masochistic\nnature; in it a man, who proved to be a replacement figure of the\nfamily doctor, attacked the subject with a \u2018sword.\u2019 The idea of a\nsword, as is so frequently the case in dreams, represented the same\nidea that was mentioned above to be associated with that of a wooden\nstethoscope. The thought of a sword reminded the subject of the passage\nin the _Nibelung Saga_, where Sigurd sleeps with his naked sword\n(_Gram_) between him and Brunhilda, an incident that had always greatly\nstruck his imagination.\n\u201cThe meaning of the symptomatic act now at last became clear. The\nsubject had placed his wooden stethoscope between him and his patients,\njust as Sigurd had placed his sword (an equivalent symbol) between him\nand the maiden he was not to touch. The act was a compromise-formation;\nit served both to gratify in his imagination the repressed wish to\nenter into nearer relations with an attractive patient (interposition\nof phallus), and at the same time to remind him that this wish was not\nto become a reality (interposition of sword). It was, so to speak, a\ncharm against yielding to temptation.\n\u201cI might add that the following passage from Lord Lytton\u2019s _Richelieu_\nmade a great impression on the boy:--\n\u2018_Beneath the rule of men entirely great\nThe pen is mightier than the sword_,\u2019[57]\nand that he became a prolific writer and uses an unusually large\nfountain-pen. When I asked him what need he had of this pen, he replied\nin a characteristic manner, \u2018I have so much to express.\u2019\n\u201cThis analysis again reminds us of the profound views that are afforded\nus in the psychic life through the \u2018harmless\u2019 and \u2018senseless\u2019 actions,\nand how early in life the tendency to symbolization develops.\u201d\nI can also relate an experience from my psychotherapeutic practice in\nwhich the hand, playing with a mass of bread-crumbs, gave evidence of\nan eloquent declaration. My patient was a boy not yet thirteen years of\nage, who had been very hysterical for two years. I finally took him for\npsychoanalytic treatment, after a lengthy stay at a hydrotherapeutic\ninstitution had proved futile. My supposition was that he must have\nhad sexual experiences, and that, corresponding to his age, he had\nbeen troubled by sexual questions; but I was cautious about helping\nhim with explanations as I wished to test further my assumption. I was\ntherefore curious as to the manner in which the desired material would\nevince itself in him.\nOne day it struck me that he was rolling something between the fingers\nof his right hand; he would thrust it into his pocket and there\ncontinue playing with it, then would draw it out again, and so on. I\ndid not ask what he had in his hand; but as he suddenly opened his hand\nhe showed it to me. It was bread-crumbs kneaded into a mass. At the\nnext session he again brought along a mass, and in the course of our\nconversation, although his eyes were closed, modelled a figure with an\nincredible rapidity which excited my interest. Without doubt it was a\nmanikin like the crudest prehistoric idols, with a head, two arms, two\nlegs, and an appendage between the legs which he drew out to a long\npoint.\nThis was scarcely completed when he kneaded the manikin together again:\nlater he allowed it to remain, but modelled an identical appendage on\nthe flat of the back and on other parts in order to veil the meaning of\nthe first. I wished to show him that I had understood him, but at the\nsame time I wanted to deprive him of the evasion that he had thought\nof nothing while actively forming these figures. With this intention\nI suddenly asked him whether he remembered the story of the Roman king\nwho gave his son\u2019s envoy a pantomimic answer in his garden.\nThe boy did not wish to recall what he must have learned so much more\nrecently than I. He asked if that was the story of the slave on whose\nbald skull the answer was written. I told him, \u201cNo, that belonged to\nGreek history,\u201d and related the following: \u201cKing Tarquinius Superbus\nhad induced his son Sextus to steal into a Latin city. The son, who had\nlater obtained a foothold in the city, sent a messenger to the king\nasking what steps he should take next. The king gave no answer, but\nwent into his garden, had the question repeated there, and silently\nstruck off the heads of the largest and most beautiful poppies.\nAll that the messenger could do was to report this to Sextus, who\nunderstood his father, and caused the most distinguished citizens of\nthe city to be removed by assassination.\u201d\nWhile I was speaking the boy stopped kneading, and as I was relating\nwhat the king did in his garden, I noticed that at the words \u201csilently\nstruck\u201d he tore off the head of the manikin with a movement as quick\nas lightning. He therefore understood me, and showed that he was also\nunderstood by me. Now I could question him directly, and gave him the\ninformation that he desired, and in a short time the neurosis came to\nan end.\nThe symptomatic actions which we observe in inexhaustible abundance in\nhealthy as well as in nervous people are worthy of our interest for\nmore than one reason. To the physician they often serve as valuable\nindications for orienting himself in new or unfamiliar conditions;\nto the keen observer they often betray everything, occasionally even\nmore than he cares to know. He who is familiar with its application\nsometimes feels like King Solomon, who, according to the Oriental\nlegend, understood the language of animals.\nOne day I was to examine a strange young man at his mother\u2019s home. As\nhe came towards me I was attracted by a large stain on his trousers,\nwhich by its peculiar stiff edges I recognized as one produced by\nalbumen. After a moment\u2019s embarrassment the young man excused this\nstain by remarking that he was hoarse and therefore drank a raw egg,\nand that some of the slippery white of the egg had probably fallen on\nhis clothes. To confirm his statements he showed the eggshell which\ncould still be seen on a small plate in the room. The suspicious spot\nwas thus explained in this harmless way; but as his mother left us\nalone I thanked him for having so greatly facilitated the diagnosis\nfor me, and without further procedure I took as the topic of our\ndiscussion his confession that he was suffering from the effects of\nmasturbation.\nAnother time I called on a woman as rich as she was miserly and\nfoolish, who was in the habit of giving the physician the task of\nworking his way through a heap of her complaints before he could reach\nthe simple cause of her condition. As I entered she was sitting at\na small table engaged in arranging silver dollars in little piles:\nas she rose she tumbled some of the pieces of money to the floor.\nI helped her pick them up, but interrupted the recitation of her\nmisery by remarking: \u201cHas your good son-in-law been spending so much\nof your money again?\u201d She bitterly denied this, only to relate a few\nmoments later the lamentable story of the aggravation caused by her\nson-in-law\u2019s extravagances. And she has not sent for me since. I cannot\nmaintain that one always makes friends of those to whom he tells the\nmeaning of their symptomatic actions.\nHe who observes his fellow-men while at table will be able to verify in\nthem the nicest and most instructive symptomatic actions.\nDr. Hans Sachs relates the following:--\n\u201cI happened to be present when an elderly couple related to me partook\nof their supper. The lady had stomach trouble and was forced to follow\na strict diet. A roast was put before the husband, and he requested\nhis wife, who was not allowed to partake of this food, to give him\nthe mustard. The wife opened the closet and took out the small bottle\nof stomach drops, and placed it on the table before her husband.\nBetween the barrel-shaped mustard-glass and the small drop-bottle\nthere was naturally no similarity through which the mishandling could\nbe explained; yet the wife only noticed the mistake after her husband\nlaughingly called her attention to it. The sense of this symptomatic\naction needs no explanation.\u201d\nFor an excellent example of this kind which was very skilfully utilized\nby the observer, I am indebted to Dr. Bernh. Dattner (Vienna):--\n\u201cI dined in a restaurant with my colleague H., a doctor of philosophy.\nHe spoke about the injustice done to probationary students, and added\nthat even before he finished his studies he was placed as secretary to\nthe ambassador, or rather the extraordinary plenipotentiary Minister to\nChili. \u2018But,\u2019 he added, \u2018the minister was afterwards transferred, and\nI did not make any effort to meet the newly appointed.\u2019 While uttering\nthe last sentence he was lifting a piece of pie to his mouth, but he\nlet it drop as if out of awkwardness. I immediately grasped the hidden\nsense of this symptomatic action, and remarked to my colleague, who was\nunacquainted with psychoanalysis, \u2018You really allowed a very choice\nmorsel to slip from you.\u2019 He did not realize, however, that my words\ncould equally refer to his symptomatic action, and he repeated the same\nwords I uttered with a peculiarly agreeable and surprising vividness,\nas if I had actually taken the words from his mouth: \u2018It was really\na very choice morsel that I allowed to get away from me.\u2019 He then\nfollowed this remark with a detailed description of his clumsiness,\nwhich has cost him this very remunerative position.\n\u201cThe sense of this symbolic action becomes clearer if we remember that\nmy colleague had scruples about telling me, almost a perfect stranger,\nconcerning his precarious material situation, and his repressed thought\ntook on the mask of symptomatic action which expressed symbolically\nwhat was meant to be concealed, and the speaker thus got relief from\nhis unconscious.\u201d\nThat the taking away or taking along things without any apparent\nintention may prove to be senseful may be shown by the following\nexamples.\nI. Dr. B. Dattner relates: \u201cAn acquaintance paid the first\nafter-marriage visit to a highly regarded lady friend of his youth. He\ntold me of this visit and expressed his surprise at the fact that he\nfailed in his resolution to visit with her only a short time, and then\nreported to me a rather strange faulty act which happened to him there.\n\u201cThe husband of this friend, who took part in the conversation, was\nlooking for a box of matches which he was sure was on the table when\nhe came there. My acquaintance, too, looked through his pockets to\nascertain whether he had not put it in his pocket, but without avail.\nSome time later he actually found it in his pocket, and was struck by\nthe fact that there was only one match in the box.\n\u201cA dream a few days later showing the box symbolism in reference to\nthe friend of his youth confirmed my explanation. With the symptomatic\naction my acquaintance meant to announce his priority-right and the\nexclusiveness of his possession (it contained only one match).\u201d\nDr. Hans Sachs relates the following: \u201cOur cook is very fond of a\ncertain kind of pie. There is no possible doubt about this, as it is\nthe only kind of pastry which she always prepares well. One Sunday she\nbrought this pie to the table, took it off the pie-plate, and proceeded\nto remove the dishes used in the former course, but on the top of this\npile she placed the pie, and disappeared with it into the kitchen. We\nfirst thought that she had something to improve on the pie, but as she\nfailed to appear my wife rang the bell and asked, \u2018Betty, what happened\nto the pie?\u2019 to which the girl answered, without comprehending the\nquestion, \u2018How is that?\u2019 We had to call her attention to the fact that\nshe carried the pie back to the kitchen. She had put it on the pile of\ndishes, taken it out, and put it away \u2018without noticing it.\u2019\n\u201cThe next day, when we were about to consume the rest of the pie,\nmy wife noticed that there was as much of it as we had left the day\nbefore--that is, the girl had disdained to eat the portion of her\nfavourite dish which was rightly hers. Questioned why she did not eat\nthe pie, she answered, somewhat embarrassed, that she did not care for\nit.\n\u201cThe infantile attitude is distinctly noticeable on both\noccasions--first the childish insatiableness in refusing to share with\nanybody the object of her wishes, then the reaction of spite which is\njust as childish: \u2018If you grudge it to me, keep it for yourself, I want\nnothing of it.\u2019\u201d\nChance or symptomatic actions occurring in affairs of married life have\noften a most serious significance, and could lead those who do not\nconcern themselves with the psychology of the unconscious to a belief\nin omens. It is not an auspicious beginning if a young woman loses her\nwedding-ring on her wedding-tour, even if it were only mislaid and soon\nfound.\nI know a woman, now divorced, who in the management of her business\naffairs frequently signed her maiden name many years before she\nactually resumed it.\nOnce I was the guest of a newly married couple and heard the young\nwoman laughingly relate her latest experience, how, on the day\nsucceeding her return from the wedding tour she had sought out her\nsingle sister in order to go shopping with her as in former times,\nwhile her husband was attending business. Suddenly she noticed a man\non the opposite side of the street; nudging her sister she said, \u201cWhy,\nthat is surely Mr. L.\u201d She forgot that for some weeks this man had been\nher husband. I was chilled at this tale, but I did not dare draw any\ninferences. The little story came back to me only several years later,\nafter this marriage had ended most unhappily.\nThe following observation, which could as well have found a place among\nthe examples of forgetting, was taken from a noteworthy work published\nin French by A. Maeder.[58]\n\u201cUne dame nous racontait r\u00e9cement qu\u2019elle avait oublie d\u2019essayer sa\nrobe de noce et s\u2019en souvint la veille du marriage, \u00e0 huit heur du\nsoir, la couturi\u00e8re d\u00e9sesp\u00e9rait de voir sa cliente. Ce d\u00e9tail suffit \u00e0\nmontrer que la fianc\u00e9e ne se sentait pas tr\u00e8s heureuse de porter une\nrobe d\u2019\u00e9pouse, elle cherchait \u00e0 oublier cette repr\u00e9sentation p\u00e9nible.\nElle est aujourd\u2019hui ... divorc\u00e9e.\u201d\nA friend who has learned to observe signs related to me that the great\nactress Eleanora Duse introduces a symptomatic action into one of her\nr\u00f4les which shows very nicely from what depth she draws her acting. It\nis a drama dealing with adultery; she has just been discussing with\nher husband and now stands soliloquizing before the seducer makes his\nappearance. During this short interval she plays with her wedding-ring,\nshe pulls it off, replaces it, and finally takes it off again. She is\nnow ready for the other.\nI know of an elderly man who married a young girl, and instead of\nstarting at once on his wedding tour he decided to spend the night in a\nhotel. Scarcely had they reached the hotel, when he noticed with fright\nthat he was without his wallet, in which he had the entire sum of money\nfor the wedding tour; he must have mislaid or lost it. He was still\nable to reach his servant by telephone; the latter found the missing\narticle in the coat discarded for the travelling clothes and brought it\nto the hotel to the waiting bridegroom, who had thus entered upon his\nmarriage without means.\nIt is consoling to think that the \u201closing of objects\u201d by people is\nmerely an unsuspected extension of a symptomatic action, and is thus\nwelcome at least to the secret intention of the loser. Often it is only\nan expression of slight appreciation of the lost article, a secret\ndislike for the same, or perhaps for the person from whom it came,\nor the desire to lose this object was transferred to it from other\nand more important objects through symbolic association. The loss of\nvaluable articles serves as an expression of diverse feelings; it\nmay either symbolically represent a repressed thought--that is, it\nmay bring back a memory which one would rather not hear--or it may\nrepresent a sacrifice to the obscure forces of fate, the worship of\nwhich is not yet entirely extinct even with us.[59]\nThe following examples will illustrate these statements concerning the\nlosing of objects:--\nDr. B. Dattner states: \u201cA colleague related to me that he lost his\nsteel pencil which he had had for over two years, and which, on\naccount of its superior quality, was highly prized by him. Analysis\nelicited the following facts: The day before he had received a very\ndisagreeable letter from his brother-in-law, the concluding sentence\nof which read: \u2018At present I have neither the desire nor the time to\nassist you in your carelessness and laziness.\u2019 The effect connected\nwith this letter was so powerful that the next day he promptly\nsacrificed the pencil which was a present from this brother-in-law in\norder not to be burdened with his favours.\u201d\nBrill reports the following example: \u201cA doctor took exception to the\nfollowing statement in my book, \u2018We never lose what we really want\u2019\n(_Psychanalysis, its Theories and Practical Application_, p. 214). His\nwife, who is very interested in psychologic subjects, read with him\nthe chapter on \u201cPsychopathology of Everyday Life\u201d; they were both very\nmuch impressed with the novelty of the ideas, and so on, and were very\nwilling to accept most of the statements. He could not, however, agree\nwith the above-given statement because, as he said to his wife, \u2018I\nsurely did not wish to lose my knife.\u2019 He referred to a valuable knife\ngiven to him by his wife, which he highly prized, the loss of which\ncaused him much pain.\n\u201cIt did not take his wife very long to discover the solution for this\nloss in a manner to convince them both of the accuracy of my statement.\nWhen she presented him with this knife he was a bit loath to accept\nit. Although he considered himself quite emancipated, he nevertheless\nentertained some superstition about giving or accepting a knife as a\ngift, because it is said that a knife cuts friendship. He even remarked\nthis to his wife, who only laughed at his superstition. He had the\nknife for years before it disappeared.\n\u201cAnalysis brought out the fact that the disappearance of the knife was\ndirectly connected with a period when there were violent quarrels\nbetween himself and his wife, which threatened to end in separation.\nThey lived happily together until his step-daughter (it was his second\nmarriage) came to live with them. His daughter was the cause of many\nmisunderstandings, and it was at the height of these quarrels that he\nlost the knife.\n\u201cThe unconscious activity is very nicely shown in this symptomatic\naction. In spite of his apparent freedom from superstition, he still\nunconsciously believed that a donated knife may cut friendship between\nthe persons concerned. The losing of it was simply an unconscious\ndefence against losing his wife, and by sacrificing the knife he made\nthe superstitious ban impotent.\u201d\nIn a lengthy discussion and with the aid of dream analysis[60] Otto\nRank made clear the sacrificial tendency with its deep-reaching\nmotivation. It must be said that just such symptomatic actions often\ngive us access to the understanding of the intimate psychic life of the\nperson.\nOf the many isolated chance-actions, I will relate one example which\nshowed a deeper meaning even without analysis. This example clearly\nexplains the conditions under which such symptoms may be produced most\ncasually, and also shows that an observation of practical importance\nmay be attached to it. During a summer tour it happened that I had to\nwait several days at a certain place for the arrival of my travelling\ncompanions. In the meantime I made the acquaintance of a young man, who\nalso seemed lonely and was quite willing to join me. As we lived at the\nsame hotel it was quite natural that we should take all our meals and\nour walks together.\nOn the afternoon of the third day he suddenly informed me that he\nexpected his wife to arrive on that evening\u2019s express train. My\npsychologic interest was now aroused, as it had already struck me\nthat morning that my companion rejected my proposal to make a long\nexcursion, and in our short walk he objected to a certain path as too\nsteep and dangerous. During our afternoon walk he suddenly thought that\nI must be hungry and insisted that I should not delay my evening meal\non his account, that he would not sup before his wife\u2019s arrival. I\nunderstood the hint and seated myself at the table while he went to the\nstation.\nThe next morning we met in the foyer of the hotel. He presented me to\nhis wife, and added, \u201cOf course, you will breakfast with us?\u201d I had\nto attend first to a small matter in the next street, but assured him\nthat I would return shortly. Later, as I entered the breakfast-room,\nI noticed that the couple were at a small table near the window, both\nseated on the same side of it. On the opposite side there was only one\nchair, which was covered, however, with a man\u2019s large and heavy coat.\nI understood well the meaning of this unintentional, none the less\nexpressive, disposition of the coat. It meant this: \u201cThere is no room\nfor you here, you are superfluous now.\u201d\nThe man did not notice that I remained standing before the table, being\nunable to take the seat, but his wife noticed it, and quickly nudged\nher husband and whispered: \u201cWhy, you have covered the gentleman\u2019s place\nwith your coat.\u201d\nThese as well as other similar experiences have caused me to think that\nthe actions executed unintentionally must inevitably become the source\nof misunderstanding in human relations. The perpetrator of the act, who\nis unaware of any associated intention, takes no account of it, and\ndoes not hold himself responsible for it. On the other hand, the second\nparty, having regularly utilized even such acts as those of his partner\nto draw conclusions as to their purpose and meaning, recognizes more\nof the stranger\u2019s psychic processes than the latter is ready either to\nadmit or believe that he has imparted. He becomes indignant when these\nconclusions drawn from his symptomatic actions are held up to him; he\ndeclares them baseless because he does not see any conscious intention\nin their execution, and complains of being misunderstood by the other.\nClose examination shows that such misunderstandings are based on the\nfact that the person is too fine an observer and understands too much.\nThe more \u201cnervous\u201d two persons are the more readily will they give\neach other cause for disputes, which are based on the fact that one as\ndefinitely denies about his own person what he is sure to accept about\nthe other.\nAnd this is, indeed, the punishment for the inner dishonesty to which\npeople grant expression under the guise of \u201cforgetting,\u201d of erroneous\nactions and accidental emotions, a feeling which they would do better\nto confess to themselves and others when they can no longer control\nit. As a matter of fact it can be generally affirmed that every one\nis continually practising psychoanalysis on his neighbours, and\nconsequently learns to know them better than each individual knows\nhimself. The road following the admonition \u03b3\u03bd\u1ff6\u03b8\u03b9 \u03c3\u03b5\u03b1\u03c5\u03c4\u1f41\u03bd leads through\nthe study of one\u2019s own apparently casual commissions and omissions.\nX\nERRORS\nErrors of memory are distinguished from forgetting and false\nrecollections through one feature only, namely, that the error (false\nrecollection) is not recognized as such but finds credence. However,\nthe use of the expression \u201cerror\u201d seems to depend on still another\ncondition. We speak of \u201cerring\u201d instead of \u201cfalsely recollecting\u201d where\nthe character of the objective reality is emphasized in the psychic\nmaterial to be reproduced--that is, where something other than a fact\nof my own psychic life is to be remembered, or rather something that\nmay be confirmed or refuted through the memory of others. The reverse\nof the error in memory in this sense is formed by ignorance.\nIn my book _The Interpretation of Dreams_,[61] I was responsible for\na series of errors in historical, and above all, in material facts,\nwhich I was astonished to discover after the appearance of the book.\nOn closer examination I found that they did not originate from my\nignorance, but could be traced to errors of memory explainable by means\nof analysis.\n(_a_) On page 361 I indicated as _Schiller\u2019s_ birthplace the city of\n_Marburg_, a name which recurs in _Styria_. The error is found in the\nanalysis of a dream during a night journey from which I was awakened\nby the conductor calling out the name of the station _Marburg_. In the\ncontents of the dream inquiry is made concerning a book by _Schiller_.\nBut _Schiller_ was not born in the university town of _Marburg_ but in\nthe Swabian city _Marbach_. I maintain that I always knew this.\n(_b_) On page 165 _Hannibal\u2019s_ father is called _Hasdrubal_. This error\nwas particularly annoying to me, but it was most corroborative of my\nconception of such errors. Few readers of the book are better posted\non the history of the _Barkides_ than the author who wrote this error\nand overlooked it in three proofs. The name of Hannibal\u2019s father was\n_Hamilcar Barkas_; _Hasdrubal_ was the name of _Hannibal\u2019s_ brother as\nwell as that of his brother-in-law and predecessor in command.\n(_c_) On pages 217 and 492 I assert that _Zeus_ emasculates his father\n_Kronos_, and hurls him from the throne. This horror I have erroneously\nadvanced by a generation; according to Greek mythology it was _Kronos_\nwho committed this on his father _Uranos_.[62]\nHow is it to be explained that my memory furnished me with false\nmaterial on these points, while it usually places the most remote and\nunusual material at my disposal, as the readers of my books can verify?\nAnd, what is more, in three carefully executed proof-readings I passed\nover these errors as if struck blind.\nGoethe said of Lichtenberg: \u201cWhere he cracks a joke, there lies a\nconcealed problem.\u201d Similarly we can affirm of these passages cited\nfrom my book: back of every error is a repression. More accurately\nstated: the error conceals a falsehood, a disfigurement which is\nultimately based on repressed material. In the analysis of the dreams\nthere reported, I was compelled by the very nature of the theme to\nwhich the dream thoughts related, on the one hand, to break off the\nanalysis in some places before it had reached its completion, and\non the other hand, to remove an indiscreet detail through a slight\ndisfigurement of its outline. I could not act differently, and had no\nother choice if I was at all to offer examples and illustrations. My\nconstrained position was necessarily brought about by the peculiarity\nof dreams, which give expression to repressed thoughts, or to material\nwhich is incapable of becoming conscious. In spite of this it is said\nthat enough material remained to offend the more sensitive souls. The\ndisfigurement or concealment of the continuing thoughts known to me\ncould not be accomplished without leaving some trace. What I wished to\nrepress has often against my will obtruded itself on what I have taken\nup, and evinced itself in the matter as an unnoticeable error. Indeed,\neach of the three examples given is based on the same theme: the errors\nare the results of repressed thoughts which occupy themselves with my\ndeceased father.\n(_ad a_) Whoever reads through the dream analysed on page 361 will\nfind some parts unveiled; in some parts he will be able to divine\nthrough allusions that I have broken off the thoughts which would have\ncontained an unfavourable criticism of my father. In the continuation\nof this line of thoughts and memories there lies an annoying tale, in\nwhich books and a business friend of my father, named _Marburg_, play\na part; it is the same name the calling out of which in the southern\nrailway-station had aroused me from sleep. I wished to suppress this\nMr. _Marburg_ in the analysis from myself and my readers: he avenged\nhimself by intruding where he did not belong, and changed the name of\nSchiller\u2019s birthplace from _Marbach_ to _Marburg_.\n(_ad b_) The error _Hasdrubal_ in place of _Hamilcar_, the name of the\nbrother instead of that of the father, originated from an association\nwhich dealt with the Hannibal fantasies of my college years and my\ndissatisfaction with the conduct of my father towards the \u201cenemies\nof our people.\u201d I could have continued and recounted how my attitude\ntoward my father was changed by a visit to England, where I made the\nacquaintance of my half-brother, by a previous marriage of my father.\nMy brother\u2019s oldest son was my age exactly. Thus the age relations were\nno hindrance to a fantasy which may be stated thus: how much pleasanter\nit would be had I been born the son of my brother instead of the son of\nmy father! This suppressed fantasy then falsified the text of my book\nat the point where I broke off the analysis, by forcing me to put the\nname of the brother for that of the father.\n(_ad c_) The influence of the memory of this same brother is\nresponsible for my having advanced by a generation the mythological\nhorror of the Greek deities. One of the admonitions of my brother has\nlingered long in my memory. \u201cDo not forget one thing concerning your\nconduct in life,\u201d he said: \u201cyou belong not to the second but really\nto the third generation of your father.\u201d Our father had remarried at\nan advanced age, and was therefore an old man to his children by the\nsecond marriage. I commit the error mentioned where I discuss the\npiety between parents and children.\nSeveral times friends and patients have called my attention to the fact\nthat in reporting their dreams or alluding to them in dream analyses,\nI have related inaccurately the circumstances experienced by us in\ncommon. These are also historic errors. On re-examining such individual\ncases I have found that my recollection of the facts was unreliable\nonly where I had purposely disfigured or concealed something in the\nanalysis. Here again we have _an unobserved error as a substitute for\nan intentional concealment or repression_.\nFrom these errors, which originate from repression, we must sharply\ndistinguish those which are based on actual ignorance. Thus, for\nexample, it was ignorance when on my excursion to Wachau I believed\nthat I had passed the resting-place of the revolutionary leader\nFischof. Only the name is common to both places. _Fischof\u2019s Emmersdorf_\nis located in K\u00e4rnthen. But I did not know any better.\nHere is another embarrassing but instructive error, an example of\ntemporary ignorance if you like. One day a patient reminded me to give\nhim the two books on Venice which I had promised him, as he wished to\nuse them in planning his Easter tour. I answered that I had them ready\nand went into the library to fetch them, though the truth of the\nmatter was that I had forgotten to look them up, since I did not quite\napprove of my patient\u2019s journey, looking upon it as an unnecessary\ninterruption to the treatment, and as a material loss to the physician.\nThereupon I made a quick survey of the library for the books.\nOne was _Venedig als Kunstst\u00e4tte_, and besides this I imagined I had an\nhistoric work of a similar order. Certainly there was _Die Mediceer_\n(_The Medicis_); I took them and brought them in to him, then,\nembarrassed, I confessed my error. Of course I really knew that the\nMedicis had nothing to do with Venice, but for a short time it did not\nappear to me at all incorrect. Now I was compelled to practise justice;\nas I had so frequently interpreted my patient\u2019s symptomatic actions I\ncould save my prestige only by being honest and admitting to him the\nsecret motives of my averseness to his trip.\nIt may cause general astonishment to learn how much stronger is the\nimpulse to tell the truth than is usually supposed. Perhaps it is a\nresult of my occupation with psychoanalysis that I can scarcely lie any\nmore. As often as I attempt a distortion I succumb to an error or some\nother faulty act, which betrays my dishonesty, as was manifest in this\nand in the preceding examples.\nOf all faulty actions the mechanism of the error seems to be the most\nsuperficial. That is, the occurrence of the error invariably indicates\nthat the mental activity concerned had to struggle with some disturbing\ninfluence, although the nature of the error need not be determined by\nthe quality of the disturbing idea, which may have remained obscure.\nIt is not out of place to add that the same state of affairs may be\nassumed in many simple cases of lapses in speaking and writing. Every\ntime we commit a lapse in speaking or writing we may conclude that\nthrough mental processes there has come a disturbance which is beyond\nour intention. It may be conceded, however, that lapses in speaking\nand writing often follow the laws of similarity and convenience, or\nthe tendency to acceleration, without allowing the disturbing element\nto leave a trace of its own character in the error resulting from\nthe lapses in speaking or writing. It is the responsiveness of the\nlinguistic material which at first makes possible the determination of\nthe error, but it also limits the same.\nIn order not to confine myself exclusively to personal errors I will\nrelate a few examples which could just as well have been ranged under\n\u201cLapses in Speech\u201d or under \u201cErroneously Carried-out Actions,\u201d but as\nall these forms of faulty action have the same value they may as well\nbe reported here.\n(_a_) I forbade a patient to speak on the telephone to his lady-love,\nwith whom he himself was willing to break off all relations, as each\nconversation only renewed the struggling against it. He was to write\nher his final decision, although there were some difficulties in the\nway of delivering the letter to her. He visited me at one o\u2019clock to\ntell me that he had found a way of avoiding these difficulties, and\namong other things he asked me whether he might refer to me in my\nprofessional capacity.\nAt two o\u2019clock while he was engaged in composing the letter of refusal,\nhe interrupted himself suddenly, and said to his mother, \u201cWell, I\nhave forgotten to ask the Professor whether I may use his name in the\nletter.\u201d He hurried to the telephone, got the connection, and asked the\nquestion, \u201cMay I speak to the Professor after his dinner?\u201d In answer\nhe got an astonished \u201cAdolf, have you gone crazy!\u201d The answering voice\nwas the very voice which at my command he had listened to for the last\ntime. He had simply \u201cmade a mistake,\u201d and in place of the physician\u2019s\nnumber had called up that of his beloved.\n(_b_) During a summer vacation a schoolteacher, a poor but excellent\nyoung man, courted the daughter of a summer resident, until the girl\nfell passionately in love with him, and even prevailed upon her family\nto countenance the matrimonial alliance in spite of the difference in\nposition and race. One day, however, the teacher wrote his brother a\nletter in which he said: \u201cPretty, the lass is not at all, but she is\nvery amiable, and so far so good. But whether I can make up my mind to\nmarry a Jewess I cannot yet tell.\u201d This letter got into the hands of\nthe fianc\u00e9e, who put an end to the engagement, while at the same time\nhis brother was wondering at the protestations of love directed to him.\nMy informer assured me that this was really an error and not a cunning\ntrick.\nI am familiar with another case in which a woman who was dissatisfied\nwith her old physician, and still did not openly wish to discharge him,\naccomplished this purpose through the interchange of letters. Here, at\nleast, I can assert confidently that it was error and not conscious\ncunning that made use of this familiar comedy-motive.\n(_c_) Brill[63] tells of a woman who, inquiring about a mutual friend,\nerroneously called her by her maiden name. Her attention having been\ndirected to this error, she had to admit that she disliked her friend\u2019s\nhusband and had never been satisfied with her marriage.\nMaeder[64] relates a good example of how a reluctantly repressed\nwish can be satisfied by means of an \u201cerror.\u201d A colleague wanted\nto enjoy his day of leave of absence absolutely undisturbed, but he\nalso felt that he ought to go to Lucerne to pay a call which he did\nnot anticipate with any pleasure. After long reflection, however, he\nconcluded to go. For pastime on the train he read the daily newspapers.\nHe journeyed from Zurich to Arth Goldau, where he changed trains for\nLucerne, all the time engrossed in reading. Presently the conductor\ninformed him that he was in the wrong train--that is, he had got into\nthe one which was returning from Goldau to Zurich, whereas his ticket\nwas for Lucerne.\nA very similar trick was played by me quite recently. I had promised my\noldest brother to pay him a long-due visit at a sea-shore in England;\nas the time was short I felt obliged to travel by the shortest route\nand without interruption. I begged for a day\u2019s sojourn in Holland,\nbut he thought that I could stop there on my return trip. Accordingly\nI journeyed from Munich through Cologne to Rotterdam--Hook of\nHolland--where I was to take the steamer at midnight to Harwich. In\nCologne I had to change cars; I left my train to go into the Rotterdam\nexpress, but it was not to be found. I asked various railway employees,\nwas sent from one platform to another, got into an exaggerated state of\ndespair, and could easily reckon that during this fruitless search I\nhad probably missed my connection.\nAfter this was corroborated, I pondered whether or not I should spend\nthe night in Cologne. This was favoured by a feeling of piety, for\naccording to an old family tradition, my ancestors were once expelled\nfrom this city during a persecution of the Jews. But eventually I\ncame to another decision; I took a later train to Rotterdam, where I\narrived late at night and was thus compelled to spend a day in Holland.\nThis brought me the fulfilment of a long-fostered wish--the sight\nof the beautiful Rembrandt paintings at The Hague and in the Royal\nMuseum at Amsterdam. Not before the next forenoon, while collecting my\nimpressions during the railway journey in England, did I definitely\nremember that only a few steps from the place where I got off at the\nrailroad station in Cologne, indeed, on the same platform, I had seen\na large sign, \u201cRotterdam--Hook of Holland.\u201d There stood the train in\nwhich I should have continued my journey.\nIf one does not wish to assume that, contrary to my brother\u2019s orders, I\nhad really resolved to admire the Rembrandt pictures on my way to him,\nthen the fact that despite clear directions I hurried away and looked\nfor another train must be designated as an incomprehensible \u201cblinding.\u201d\nEverything else--my well-acted perplexity, the emergence of the pious\nintention to spend the night in Cologne--was only a contrivance to hide\nmy resolution until it had been fully accomplished.\nOne may possibly be disinclined to consider the class of errors which I\nhave here explained as very numerous or particularly significant. But I\nleave it to your consideration whether there is no ground for extending\nthe same points of view also to the more important errors of judgment,\nas evinced by people in life and science. Only for the most select\nand most balanced minds does it seem possible to guard the perceived\npicture of external reality against the distortion to which it is\notherwise subjected in its transit through the psychic individuality of\nthe one perceiving it.\nXI\nCOMBINED FAULTY ACTS\nTwo of the last-mentioned examples, my error which transfers the\nMedici to Venice and that of the young man who knew how to circumvent\na command against a conversation on the telephone with his lady love,\nhave really not been fully discussed, as after careful consideration\nthey may be shown to represent a union of forgetting with an error. I\ncan show the same union still more clearly in certain other examples.\n(_a_) A friend related to me the following experience: \u201cSome years\nago I consented to be elected to the committee of a certain literary\nsociety, as I supposed the organization might some time be of use to\nme in assisting me in the production of my drama. Although not much\ninterested, I attended the meetings regularly every Friday. Some months\nago I was definitely assured that one of my dramas would be presented\nat the theatre in F., and since that time it regularly happened that\nI forgot the meeting of the association. As I read their programme\nannouncements I was ashamed of my forgetfulness. I reproached myself,\nfeeling that it was certainly rude of me to stay away now when I no\nlonger needed them, and determined that I would certainly not forget\nthe next Friday. Continually I reminded myself of this resolution\nuntil the hour came and I stood before the door of the meeting-room.\nTo my astonishment it was locked; the meeting was already over. I had\nmistaken my day; it was already Saturday!\u201d\n(_b_) The next example is the combination of a symptomatic action\nwith a case of mislaying; it reached me by remote byways, but from a\nreliable source.\nA woman travelled to Rome with her brother-in-law, a renowned artist.\nThe visitor was highly honoured by the German residents of Rome, and\namong other things received a gold medal of antique origin. The woman\nwas grieved that her brother-in-law did not sufficiently appreciate\nthe value of this beautiful gift. After she had returned home she\ndiscovered in unpacking that--without knowing how--she had brought the\nmedal home with her. She immediately notified her brother-in-law of\nthis by letter, and informed him that she would send it back to Rome\nthe next day. The next day, however, the medal was so aptly mislaid\nthat it could not be found and could not be sent back, and then it\ndawned on the woman what her \u201cabsent-mindedness\u201d signified--namely,\nthat she wished to keep the medal herself.\n(_c_) Here are some cases in which the falsified action persistently\nrepeats itself, and at the same time also changes its mode of action:--\nDue to unknown motives, Jones[65] left a letter for several days on his\ndesk, forgetting each time to post it. He ultimately posted it, but\nit was returned to him from the Dead-letter Office because he forgot\nto address it. After addressing and posting it a second time it was\nagain returned to him, this time without a stamp. He was then forced to\nrecognize the unconscious opposition to the sending of the letter.\n(_d_) A short account by Dr. Karl Weiss (Vienna)[66] of a case of\nforgetting impressively describes the futile effort to accomplish\nsomething in the face of opposition. \u201cHow persistently the unconscious\nactivity can achieve its purpose if it has cause to prevent a\nresolution from being executed, and how difficult it is to guard\nagainst this tendency, will be illustrated by the following incident:\nAn acquaintance requested me to lend him a book and bring it to him the\nnext day. I immediately promised it, but perceived a distinct feeling\nof displeasure which I could not explain at the time. Later it became\nclear to me: this acquaintance had owed me for years a sum of money\nwhich he evidently had no intention of returning. I did not give this\nmatter any more thought, but I recalled it the following forenoon with\nthe same feeling of displeasure, and at once said to myself: \u2018Your\nunconscious will see to it that you forget the book, but you don\u2019t wish\nto appear unobliging and will therefore do everything not to forget\nit.\u2019 I came home, wrapped the book in paper, and put it near me on the\ndesk while I wrote some letters.\n\u201cA little later I went away, but after a few steps I recollected that I\nhad left on the desk the letters which I wished to post. (By the way,\none of the letters was written to a person who urged me to undertake\nsomething disagreeable.) I returned, took the letters, and again left.\nWhile in the street-car it occurred to me that I had undertaken to\npurchase something for my wife, and I was pleased at the thought that\nit would be only a small package. The association, \u2018small package,\u2019\nsuddenly recalled \u2018book\u2019--and only then I noticed that I did not have\nthe book with me. Not only had I forgotten it when I left my home the\nfirst time, but I had overlooked it again when I got the letters near\nwhich it lay.\u201d\n(_e_) A similar mechanism is shown in the following fully analysed\nobservation of Otto Rank[67]:--\n\u201cA scrupulously orderly and pedantically precise man reported the\nfollowing occurrence, which he considered quite remarkable: One\nafternoon on the street wishing to find out the time, he discovered\nthat he had left his watch at home, an omission which to his knowledge\nhad never occurred before. As he had an engagement elsewhere and had\nnot enough time to return for his watch, he made use of a visit to a\nwoman friend to borrow her watch for the evening. This was the most\nconvenient way out of the dilemma, as he had a previous engagement to\nvisit this lady the next day. Accordingly, he promised to return her\nwatch at that time.\n\u201cBut the following day when about to consummate this he found to his\nsurprise that he had left the watch at home; his own watch he had with\nhim. He then firmly resolved to return the lady\u2019s property that same\nafternoon, and even followed out his resolution. But on wishing to see\nthe time on leaving her he found to his chagrin and astonishment that\nhe had again forgotten to take his own watch.\n\u201cThe repetition of this faulty action seemed so pathologic to this\norder-loving man that he was quite anxious to know its psychologic\nmotivation, and when questioned whether he experienced anything\ndisagreeable on the critical day of the first forgetting, and in what\nconnection it had occurred, the motive was promptly found. He related\nthat he had conversed with his mother after luncheon, shortly before\nleaving the house. She told him that an irresponsible relative, who had\nalready caused him much worry and loss of money, had pawned his (the\nrelative\u2019s) watch, and, as it was needed in the house, the relative had\nasked for money to redeem it. This almost \u201cforced\u201d loan affected our\nman very painfully and brought back to his memory all the disagreeable\nepisodes perpetrated by this relative for many years.\n\u201cHis symptomatic action therefore proves to be manifoldly determined.\nFirst, it gives expression to a stream of thought which runs perhaps\nas follows: \u2018I won\u2019t allow my money to be extorted this way, and if\na watch is needed I will leave my own at home.\u2019 But as he needed it\nfor the evening to keep his appointment, this intention could only\nbe brought about on an unconscious path in the form of a symptomatic\naction. Second, the forgetting expresses a sentiment something like\nthe following: \u2018This everlasting sacrificing of money for this\ngood-for-nothing is bound to ruin me altogether, so that I will have to\ngive up everything.\u2019 Although the anger, according to the report of\nthis man, was only momentary, the repetition of the same symptomatic\naction conclusively shows that in the unconscious it continued to act\nmore intensely, and may be equivalent to the conscious expression:\n\u2018I cannot get this story out of my head.[68] That the lady\u2019s watch\nshould later meet the same fate will not surprise us after knowing this\nattitude of the unconscious.\u2019\n\u201cYet there may be still other special motives which favour the\ntransference on the \u2018innocent\u2019 lady\u2019s watch. The nearest motive is\nprobably that he would have liked to keep it as a substitute for his\nown sacrificed watch, and that hence he forgot to return it the next\nday. He also might have liked to possess this watch as a souvenir of\nthe lady. Moreover, the forgetting of the lady\u2019s watch gave him the\nexcuse for calling on the admired one a second time; for he was obliged\nto visit her in the morning in reference to another matter, and with\nthe forgetting of the watch he seemed to indicate that this visit for\nwhich an appointment had been made so long ago was too good for him to\nbe used simply for the return of a watch.\n\u201cTwice forgetting his own watch and thus making possible the\nsubstitution of the lady\u2019s watch speaks for the fact that our man\nunconsciously endeavoured to avoid carrying both watches at the same\ntime. He obviously thought of avoiding the appearance of superfluity\nwhich would have stood out in striking contrast to the want of the\nrelative; but, on the other hand, he utilized this as a self-admonition\nagainst his apparent intention to marry this lady, reminding himself\nthat he was tied to his family (mother) by indissoluble obligations.\n\u201cFinally, another reason for the forgetting of the lady\u2019s watch may be\nsought in the fact that the evening before he, a bachelor, was ashamed\nto be seen with a lady\u2019s watch by his friends, so that he only looked\nat it stealthily, and in order to evade the repetition of this painful\nsituation he could not take the watch along. But as he was obliged\nto return it, there resulted here, too, an unconsciously performed\nsymptomatic action which proved to be a compromise formation between\nconflicting emotional feelings and a dearly bought victory of the\nunconscious instance.\u201d\nIn the same discussion Rank has also paid attention to the very\ninteresting relation of \u201cfaulty actions and dreams,\u201d which cannot,\nhowever, be followed here without a comprehensive analysis of the dream\nwith which the faulty action is connected. I once dreamed at great\nlength that I had lost my pocket-book. In the morning while dressing I\nactually missed it; while undressing the night before the dream I had\nforgotten to take it out of my trousers pocket and put it in its usual\nplace. This forgetting was therefore not unknown to me; probably it was\nto give expression to an unconscious thought which was ready to appear\nin the dream content.\nI do not mean to assert that such cases of combined faulty actions can\nteach anything new that we have not already seen in the individual\ncases. But this change in form of the faulty action, which nevertheless\nattains the same result, gives the plastic impression of a will working\ntowards a definite end, and in a far more energetic way contradicts\nthe idea that the faulty action represents something fortuitous and\nrequires no explanation. Not less remarkable is the fact that the\nconscious intention thoroughly fails to check the success of the faulty\naction. Despite all, my friend did not pay his visit to the meeting\nof the literary society, and the woman found it impossible to give\nup the medal. That unconscious something which worked against these\nresolutions found another outlet after the first road was closed to it.\nIt requires something other than the conscious counter-resolution to\novercome the unknown motive; it requires a psychic work which makes the\nunknown known to consciousness.\nXII\nDETERMINISM--CHANCE--AND SUPERSTITIOUS BELIEFS\nPOINTS OF VIEW.\nAs the general result of the preceding separate discussions we must\nput down the following principle: _Certain inadequacies of our psychic\ncapacities--whose common character will soon be more definitely\ndetermined--and certain performances which are apparently unintentional\nprove to be well motivated when subjected to the psychoanalytic\ninvestigation, and are determined through the consciousness of unknown\nmotives._\nIn order to belong to this class of phenomena thus explained a faulty\npsychic action must satisfy the following conditions:--\n(_a_) It must not exceed a certain measure, which is firmly established\nthrough our estimation, and is designated by the expression \u201cwithin\nnormal limits.\u201d\n(_b_) It must evince the character of the momentary and temporary\ndisturbance. The same action must have been previously performed more\ncorrectly or we must always rely on ourselves to perform it more\ncorrectly; if we are corrected by others we must immediately recognize\nthe truth of the correction and the incorrectness of our psychic action.\n(_c_) If we at all perceive a faulty action, we must not perceive in\nourselves any motivation of the same, but must attempt to explain it\nthrough \u201cinattention\u201d or attribute it to an \u201caccident.\u201d\nThus there remain in this group the cases of forgetting and the errors,\ndespite better knowledge, the lapses in speaking, reading, writing, the\nerroneously carried-out actions, and the so-called chance actions. The\nexplanations of these so definite psychic processes are connected with\na series of observations which may in part arouse further interest.\nI. By abandoning a part of our psychic capacity as unexplainable\nthrough purposive ideas we ignore the realms of determinism in our\nmental life. Here, as in still other spheres, determinism reaches\nfarther than we suppose. In the year 1900 I read an essay published\nin the _Zeit_ written by the literary historian R. M. Meyer, in which\nhe maintains, and illustrates by examples, that it is impossible to\ncompose nonsense intentionally and arbitrarily. For some time I have\nbeen aware that it is impossible to think of a number, or even of\na name, of one\u2019s own free will. If one investigates this seeming\nvoluntary formation, let us say, of a number of many digits uttered\nin unrestrained mirth, it always proves to be so strictly determined\nthat the determination seems impossible. I will now briefly discuss an\nexample of an \u201carbitrarily chosen\u201d first name, and then exhaustively\nanalyse an analogous example of a \u201cthoughtlessly uttered\u201d number.\nWhile preparing the history of one of my patients for publication I\nconsidered what first name I should give her in the article. There\nseemed to be a wide choice; of course, certain names were at once\nexcluded by me, in the first place the real name, then the names of\nmembers of my family to which I would have objected, also some female\nnames having an especially peculiar pronunciation. But, excluding\nthese, there should have been no need of being puzzled about such\na name. It would be thought, and I myself supposed, that a whole\nmultitude of feminine names would be placed at my disposal. Instead of\nthis only one sprang up, no other besides it; it was the name Dora.\nI inquired as to its determination: \u201cWho else is called Dora?\u201d I wished\nto reject the next idea as incredulous; it occurred to me that the\nnurse of my sister\u2019s children was named Dora. But I possess so much\nself-control, or practice in analysis, if you like, that I held firmly\nto the idea and proceeded. Then a slight incident of the previous\nevening soon flashed through my mind which brought the looked-for\ndetermination. On my sister\u2019s dining-room table I noticed a letter\nbearing the address, \u201cMiss Rosa W.\u201d Astonished, I asked whose name this\nwas, and was informed that the right name of the supposed Dora was\nreally Rosa, and that on accepting the position she had to lay aside\nher name, because Rosa would also refer to my sister. I said pityingly,\n\u201cPoor people! They cannot even retain their own names!\u201d I now recall\nthat on hearing this I became quiet for a moment and began to think of\nall sorts of serious matters which merged into the obscure, but which\nI could now easily bring into my consciousness. Thus when I sought a\nname for a person _who could not retain her own name_ no other except\n\u201cDora\u201d occurred to me. The exclusiveness here is based, moreover, on\nfirmer internal associations, for in the history of my patient it was a\nstranger in the house, the governess, who exerted a decisive influence\non the course of the treatment.\nThis slight incident found its unexpected continuation many years\nlater. While discussing in a lecture the long-since published history\nof the girl called Dora it occurred to me that one of my two women\npupils had the very name Dora which I was obliged to utter so often in\nthe different associations of the case. I turned to the young student,\nwhom I knew personally, with the apology that I had really not thought\nthat she bore the same name, and that I was ready to substitute it in\nmy lecture by another name.\nI was now confronted with the task of rapidly choosing another name,\nand reflected that I must not now choose the first name of the other\nwoman student, and so set a poor example to the class, who were already\nquite conversant with psychoanalysis. I was therefore well pleased when\nthe name \u201cErna\u201d occurred to me as the substitute for Dora, and Erna I\nused in the discourse. After the lecture I asked myself whence the name\n\u201cErna\u201d could possibly have originated, and had to laugh as I observed\nthat the feared possibility in the choice of the substitutive name\nhad come to pass, in part at least. The other lady\u2019s family name was\nLucerna, of which Erna was a part.\nIn a letter to a friend I informed him that I had finished reading the\nproof-sheets of _The Interpretation of Dreams_, and that I did not\nintend to make any further changes in it, \u201ceven if it contained _2,467_\nmistakes.\u201d I immediately attempted to explain to myself the number,\nand added this little analysis as a postscript to the letter. It will\nbe best to quote it now as I wrote it when I caught myself in this\ntransaction:--\n\u201cI will add hastily another contribution to the Psychopathology of\nEveryday Life. You will find in the letter the number 2,467 as a\njocose and arbitrary estimation of the number of errors that may be\nfound in the dream-book. I meant to write: no matter how large the\nnumber might be, and this one presented itself. But there is nothing\narbitrary or undetermined in the psychic life. You will therefore\nrightly suppose that the unconscious hastened to determine the number\nwhich was liberated by consciousness. Just previous to this I had read\nin the paper that General E. M. had been retired as Inspector-General\nof Ordnance. You must know that I am interested in this man. While I\nwas serving as military medical student he, then a colonel, once came\ninto the hospital and said to the physician: \u2018You must make me well in\neight days, as I have some work to do for which the Emperor is waiting.\u2019\n\u201cAt that time I decided to follow this man\u2019s career, and just think,\nto-day (1899) he is at the end of it--Inspector-General of Ordnance\nand already retired. I wished to figure out in what time he had\ncovered this road, and assumed that I had seen him in the hospital in\n1882. That would make 17 years. I related this to my wife, and she\nremarked, \u2018Then you, too, should be retired.\u2019 And I protested, \u2018The\nLord forbid!\u2019 After this conversation I seated myself at the table to\nwrite to you. The previous train of thought continued, and for good\nreason. The figuring was incorrect; I had a definite recollection of\nthe circumstances in my mind. I had celebrated my coming of age, my\n_24th_ birthday, in the military prison (for being absent without\npermission). Therefore I must have seen him in 1880, which makes it 19\nyears ago. You then have the number 24 in 2,467! Now take the number\nthat represents my age, 43, and add 24 years to it and you get _67_!\nThat is, to the question whether I wished to retire I had expressed the\nwish to work 24 years more. Obviously I am annoyed that in the interval\nduring which I followed Colonel M. I have not accomplished much myself,\nand still there is a sort of triumph in the fact that he is already\nfinished, while I still have all before me. Thus we may justly say\nthat not even the unintentionally thrown-out number 2,467 lacks its\ndetermination from the unconscious.\u201d\nSince this first example of the interpretation of an apparently\narbitrary choice of a number I have repeated a similar test with the\nsame result; but most cases are of such intimate content that they do\nnot lend themselves to report.\nIt is for this reason that I shall not hesitate to add here a very\ninteresting analysis of a \u201cchance number\u201d which Dr. Alfred Adler\n(Vienna) received from a \u201cperfectly healthy\u201d man.[69] A. wrote to\nme: \u201cLast night I devoted myself to the _Psychopathology of Everyday_\nLife, and I would have read it all through had I not been hindered\nby a remarkable coincidence. When I read that every number that we\napparently conjure up quite arbitrarily in our consciousness has a\ndefinite meaning, I decided to test it. The number 1,734 occurred\nto my mind. The following associations then came up: 1,734 \u00f7 17 =\n102; 102 \u00f7 17 = 6. I then separated the number into 17 and 34. I am\n34 years old. I believe that I once told you that I consider 34 the\nlast year of youth, and for this reason I felt miserable on my last\nbirthday. The end of my 17th year was the beginning of a very nice and\ninteresting period of my development. I divide my life into periods of\n17 years. What do the divisions signify? The number 102 recalls the\nfact that volume 102 of the Reclam Universal Library is Kotzebue\u2019s play\n_Menschenhass und Reue_ (_Human Hatred and Repentance_).\n\u201cMy present psychic state is \u2018human hatred and repentance.\u2019 No. 6 of\nthe U. L. (I know a great many numbers by heart) is Mullner\u2019s \u2018Schuld\u2019\n(Fault). I am constantly annoyed at the thought that it is through\nmy own fault that I have not become what I could have been with my\nabilities.\n\u201cI then asked myself, \u2018What is No. 17 of the U. L.?\u2019 But I could not\nrecall it. But as I positively knew it before, I assumed that I wished\nto forget this number. All reflection was in vain. I wished to continue\nwith my reading, but I read only mechanically without understanding\na word, for I was annoyed by the number 17. I extinguished the light\nand continued my search. It finally came to me that number 17 must be\na play by Shakespeare. But which one? I thought of Hero and Leander.\nApparently a stupid attempt of my will to distract me. I finally arose\nand consulted the catalogue of the U. L. Number 17 was _Macbeth_! To my\nsurprise I had to discover that I knew nothing of the play, despite the\nfact that it did not interest me any less than any other Shakespearean\ndrama. I only thought of: murder, Lady Macbeth, witches, \u2018nice is\nugly,\u2019 and that I found Schiller\u2019s version of _Macbeth_ very nice.\nUndoubtedly I also wished to forget the play. Then it occurred to me\nthat 17 and 34 may be divided by 17 and result in 1 and 2. Numbers 1\nand 2 of the U. L. is Goethe\u2019s _Faust_. Formerly I found much of Faust\nin me.\u201d\nWe must regret that the discretion of the physician did not allow us\nto see the significance of ideas. Adler remarked that the man did not\nsucceed in the synthesis of his analysis. His association would hardly\nbe worth reporting unless their continuation would bring out something\nthat would give us the key to the understanding of the number 1,734 and\nthe whole series of ideas.\nTo quote further: \u201cTo be sure this morning I had an experience which\nspeaks much for the correctness of the Freudian conception. My wife,\nwhom I awakened through my getting up at night, asked me what I wanted\nwith the catalogue of the U. L. I told her the story. She found it all\npettifogging but--very interesting. _Macbeth_, which caused me so much\ntrouble, she simply passed over. She said that nothing came to her mind\nwhen she thought of a number. I answered, \u2018Let us try it.\u2019 She named\nthe number 117. To this I immediately replied: \u201817 refers to what I\njust told you; furthermore, I told you yesterday that if a wife is in\nthe 82nd year and the husband is in the 35th year it must be a gross\nmisunderstanding.\u2019 For the last few days I have been teasing my wife\nby maintaining that she was a little old mother of 82 years. 82 + 35 =\n117.\u201d\nThe man who did not know how to determine his own number at once\nfound the solution when his wife named a number which was apparently\narbitrarily chosen. As a matter of fact, the woman understood very well\nfrom which complex the number of her husband originated, and chose her\nown number from the same complex, which was surely common to both, as\nit dealt in his case with their relative ages. Now, we find it easy to\ninterpret the number that occurred to the man. As Dr. Adler indicates,\nit expressed a repressed wish of the husband which, fully developed,\nwould read: \u201cFor a man of 34 years as I am, only a woman of 17 would be\nsuitable.\u201d\nLest one should think too lightly of such \u201cplaying,\u201d I will add that I\nwas recently informed by Dr. Adler that a year after the publication of\nthis analysis the man was divorced from his wife.[70]\nAdler gives a similar explanation for the origin of obsessive numbers.\nAlso the choice of so-called \u201cfavourite numbers\u201d is not without\nrelation to the life of the person concerned, and does not lack a\ncertain psychologic interest. A gentleman who evinced a particular\npartiality for the numbers 17 and 19 could specify, after brief\nreflection, that at the age of 17 he attained the greatly longed-for\nacademic freedom by having been admitted to the university, that at 19\nhe made his first long journey, and shortly thereafter made his first\nscientific discovery. But the fixation of this preference followed\nlater, after two questionable affairs, when the same numbers were\ninvested with importance in his \u201clove-life.\u201d\nIndeed, even those numbers which we use in a particular connection\nextremely often and with apparent arbitrariness can be traced by\nanalysis to an unexpected meaning. Thus, one day it struck one of my\npatients that he was particularly fond of saying, \u201cI have already told\nyou this from 17 to 36 times.\u201d And he asked himself whether there was\nany motive for it. It soon occurred to him that he was born on the 27th\nday of the month, and that his younger brother was born on the 26th\nday of another month, and he had grounds for complaint that Fate had\nrobbed him of so many of the benefits of life only to bestow them on\nhis younger brother. Thus he represented this partiality of Fate by\ndeducting 10 from the date of his birth and adding it to the date of\nhis brother\u2019s birthday. I am the elder and yet am so \u201ccut short.\u201d\nI shall tarry a little longer at the analysis of chance numbers, for\nI know of no other individual observation which would so readily\ndemonstrate the existence of highly organized thinking processes of\nwhich consciousness has no knowledge. Moreover, there is no better\nexample of analysis in which the suggestion of the position, a frequent\naccusation, is so distinctly out of consideration. I shall therefore\nreport the analysis of a chance number of one of my patients (with\nhis consent), to which I will only add that he is the youngest of many\nchildren and that he lost his beloved father in his young years.\nWhile in a particularly happy mood he let the number _426,718_ come to\nhis mind, and put to himself the question, \u201cWell, what does it bring\nto your mind?\u201d First came a joke he had heard: \u201cIf your catarrh of the\nnose is treated by a doctor it lasts 42 days, if it is not treated it\nlasts--6 weeks.\u201d This corresponds to the first digit of the number (42\n= 6 \u00d7 7). During the obstruction that followed this first solution I\ncalled his attention to the fact that the number of six digits selected\nby him contains all the first numbers except 3 and 5. He at once found\nthe continuation of this solution:--\n\u201cWe were altogether 7 children, I was the youngest. Number 3 in the\norder of the children corresponds to my sister A., and 5 to my brother\nL.; both of them were my enemies. As a child I used to pray to the Lord\nevery night that He should take out of my life these two tormenting\nspirits. It seems to me that I have fulfilled for myself this wish: \u20183\u2019\nand \u20185,\u2019 the _evil_ brother and the hated sister, are omitted.\u201d\n\u201cIf the number stands for your sisters and brothers, what significance\nis there to 18 at the end? You were altogether only 7.\u201d\n\u201cI often thought if my father had lived longer I should not have been\nthe youngest child. If one more would have come, we should have been\n8, and there would have been a younger child, toward whom I could have\nplayed the r\u00f4le of the older one.\u201d\nWith this the number was explained, but we still wished to find the\nconnection between the first part of the interpretation and the part\nfollowing it. This came very readily from the condition required for\nthe last digits--if the father had lived longer. 42 = 6 \u00d7 7 signifies\nthe ridicule directed against the doctors who could not help the\nfather, and in this way expresses the wish for the continued existence\nof the father. The whole number really corresponds to the fulfilment of\nhis two wishes in reference to his family circle--namely, that both the\nevil brother and sister should die and that another little child should\nfollow him. Or, briefly expressed: _If only these two had died in place\nof my father!_[71]\nAnother analysis of numbers I take from Jones.[72] A gentleman of his\nacquaintance let the number 986 come to his mind, and defied him to\nconnect it to anything of special interest in his mind. \u201cSix years\nago, on the hottest day he could remember, he had seen a joke in an\nevening newspaper, which stated that the thermometer had stood at\n98\u00b76\u00b0 F., evidently an exaggeration of 98\u00b76\u00b0 F. We were at the time\nseated in front of a very hot fire, from which he had just drawn back,\nand he remarked, probably quite correctly, that the heat had aroused\nhis dormant memory. However, I was curious to know why this memory had\npersisted with such vividness as to be so readily brought out, for with\nmost people it surely would have been forgotten beyond recall, unless\nit had become associated with some other mental experience of more\nsignificance.\n\u201cHe told me that on reading the joke he had laughed uproariously, and\nthat on many subsequent occasions he had recalled it with great relish.\nAs the joke was obviously of an exceedingly tenuous nature, this\nstrengthened my expectation that more lay behind. His next thought was\nthe general reflection that the conception of heat had always greatly\nimpressed him, that heat was the most important thing in the universe,\nthe source of all life, and so on. This remarkable attitude of a quite\nprosaic young man certainly needed some explanation, so I asked him\nto continue his free associations. The next thought was of a factory\nstack which he could see from his bedroom window. He often stood of an\nevening watching the flame and smoke issuing out of it, and reflecting\non this deplorable waste of energy. Heat, flame, the source of life,\nthe waste of vital energy issuing from an upright, hollow tube--it\nwas not hard to divine from such associations that the ideas of heat\nand fire were unconsciously linked in his mind with the idea of love,\nas is so frequent in symbolic thinking, and that there was a strong\nmasturbation complex present, a conclusion that he presently confirmed.\u201d\nThose who wish to get a good impression of the way the material of\nnumbers becomes elaborated in the unconscious thinking, I refer to two\npapers by Jung[73] and Jones.[74]\nIn personal analysis of this kind two things were especially striking.\nFirst, the absolute somnambulistic certainty with which I attacked\nthe unknown objective point, merging into a mathematical train of\nthought, which later suddenly extended to the looked-for number, and\nthe rapidity with which the entire subsequent work was performed.\nSecondly, the fact that the numbers were always at the disposal of my\nunconscious mind, when as a matter of fact I am a poor mathematician\nand find it very difficult to consciously recall years, house numbers,\nand the like. Moreover, in these unconscious mental operations with\nfigures I found a tendency to superstition, the origin of which had\nlong remained unknown to me.\nIt will not surprise us to find that not only numbers but also mental\noccurrences of different kinds of words regularly prove on analytic\ninvestigation to be well determined.\nBrill relates: \u201cWhile working on the English edition of this book I was\nobsessed one morning with the strange word \u2018Cardillac.\u2019 Busily intent\non my work, I refused at first to pay attention to it, but, as is\nusually the case, I simply could not do anything else. \u2018Cardillac\u2019 was\nconstantly in my mind. Realizing that my refusal to recognize it was\nonly a resistance, I decided to analyse it. The following associations\noccurred to me: _Cardillac_, _cardiac_, _carrefour_, _Cadillac_.\n\u201c_Cardiac_ recalled cardalgia--heartache--a medical friend who had\nrecently told me confidentially that he feared that he had some cardiac\naffection because he had suffered some attacks of pain in the region\nof his heart. Knowing him so well, I at once rejected his theory, and\ntold him that his attacks were of a neurotic character, and that his\nother apparent physical ailments were also only the expression of his\nneurosis.\n\u201cI might add that just before telling me of his heart trouble he spoke\nof a business matter of vital interest to him which had suddenly come\nto naught. Being a man of unbounded ambitions, he was very depressed\nbecause of late he had suffered many similar reverses. His neurotic\nconflicts, however, had become manifest a few months before this\nmisfortune. Soon after his father\u2019s death had left a big business on\nhis hands. As the business could be continued only under my friend\u2019s\nmanagement, he was unable to decide whether to enter into commercial\nlife or continue his chosen career. His great ambition was to become a\nsuccessful medical practitioner, and although he had practised medicine\nsuccessfully for many years, he was not altogether satisfied with the\nfinancial fluctuations of his professional income. On the other hand,\nhis father\u2019s business promised him an assured, though limited, return.\nIn brief, he was \u2018at a crossing and did not know which way to turn.\u2019\n\u201cI then recalled the word _carrefour_, which is the French for\n\u2018crossing,\u2019 and it occurred to me that while working in a hospital\nin Paris I lived near the \u2018Carrefour St. Lazarre.\u2019 And now I could\nunderstand what relation all these associations had for me.\n\u201cWhen I resolved to leave the State Hospital I made the decision,\nfirst, because I desired to get married, and, secondly, because I\nwished to enter private practice. This brought up a new problem.\nAlthough my State hospital service was an absolute success, judging\nby promotions and so on, I felt like a great many others in the\nsame situation, namely, that my training was ill suited for private\npractice. To specialize in mental work was a daring undertaking for one\nwithout money and social connections. I also felt that the best I could\ndo for patients should they ever come my way would be to commit them to\none of the hospitals, as I had little confidence in the home treatment\nin vogue. In spite of the enormous advances made in recent years in\nmental work, the specialist is almost helpless when he is confronted\nwith the average case of insanity. This may be partially attributed\nto the fact that such cases are brought to him after they have fully\ndeveloped the psychosis when hospital treatment is imperative. Of the\ngreat army of milder mental disturbances, the so-called border-line\ncases, which make up the bulk of clinic and private work and which\nrightfully belong to the mental specialist, I knew very little, as\nthose patients rarely, or never, came to the State hospital, and what I\ndid know concerning the treatment of neurasthenia and psychasthenia was\nnot conducive to make me more hopeful of success in private practice.\n\u201cIt was in this state of mind that I came to Paris, where I hoped to\nlearn enough about the psychoneuroses to enable me to continue my\nspecialty in private practice, and yet feel that I could do something\nfor my patients. What I saw in Paris did not, however, help to change\nmy state of mind. There, too, most of the work was directed to dead\ntissues. The mental aspects, as such, received but scant attention.\nI was, therefore, seriously thinking of giving up my mental work for\nsome other specialty. As can be seen, I was confronted with a situation\nsimilar to the one of my medical friend. I, too, was at a crossing and\ndid not know which way to turn. My suspense was soon ended. One day\nI received a letter from my friend Professor Peterson, who, by the\nway, was responsible for my entering the State hospital service. In\nthis letter he advised me not to give up my work, and suggested the\npsychiatric clinic of Zurich, where he thought I could find what I\ndesired.\n\u201cBut what does _Cadillac_ mean? Cadillac is the name of a hotel and\nof an automobile. A few days before in a country place my medical\nfriend and I had been trying to hire an automobile, but there was none\nto be had. We both expressed the wish to own an automobile--again an\nunrealized ambition. I also recalled that the \u2018Carrefour St. Lazarre\u2019\nalways impressed me as being one of the busiest thoroughfares in Paris.\nIt was always congested with automobiles. Cadillac also recalled that\nonly a few days ago on the way to my clinic I noticed a large sign over\na building which announced that on a certain day \u2018this building was\nto be occupied by the Cadillac,\u2019 etc. This at first made me think of\nthe Cadillac Hotel, but on second sight I noticed that it referred to\nthe Cadillac motor-car. There was a sudden obstruction here for a few\nmoments. The word Cadillac reappeared and by sound association the word\n_catalogue_ occurred to me. This word brought back a very mortifying\noccurrence of recent origin, the motive of which is again blighted\nambition.\n\u201cWhen one wishes to report any auto-analysis he must be prepared to lay\nbare many intimate affairs of his own life. Any one reading carefully\nProfessor Freud\u2019s works cannot fail to become intimately acquainted\nwith him and his family. I have often been asked by persons who claim\nto have read and studied Freud\u2019s works such questions as: \u2018How old is\nFreud?\u2019 \u2018Is Freud married?\u2019 \u2018How many children has he?\u2019 etc. Whenever I\nhear these or similar questions I know that the questioner has either\nlied when he made these assertions, or, to be more charitable, that he\nis a very careless and superficial reader. All these questions and many\nmore are answered in Freud\u2019s works. Auto-analyses are autobiographies\n_par excellence_; but whereas the autobiographer may for definite\nreasons consciously and unconsciously hide many facts of his life, the\nauto-analyst not only tells the truth consciously, but perforce brings\nto light his whole intimate personality. It is for these reasons that\none finds it very unpleasant to report his own auto-analyses. However,\nas we often report our patients\u2019 unconscious productions, it is but\nfair that we should sacrifice ourselves on the altar of publicity when\noccasion demands. This is my apology for having thrust some of my\npersonal affairs on the reader, and for being obliged to continue a\nlittle longer in the same strain.\n\u201cBefore digressing with the last remarks I mentioned that the word\n_Cadillac_ brought the sound association _catalogue_. This association\nbrought back another important epoch in my life with which Professor\nPeterson is connected. Last May I was informed by the secretary of\nthe faculty that I was appointed chief of clinic of the department of\npsychiatry. I need hardly say that I was exceedingly pleased to be\nso honoured--in the first place because it was the realization of an\nambition which I dared entertain only under special euphoric states;\nand, secondly, it was a compensation for the many unmerited criticisms\nfrom those who are blindly and unreasonably opposing some of my work.\nSoon thereafter I called on the stenographer of the faculty and spoke\nto her about a correction to be made in my name as it was printed in\nthe catalogue. For some unknown reason (perhaps racial prejudice) this\nstenographer, a maiden lady, must have taken a dislike to me. For\nabout three years I repeatedly requested her to have this correction\nmade, but she had paid no attention to me. To be sure she always\npromised to attend to it, but the mistake remained uncorrected.\n\u201cWhen I saw her last May I again reminded her of this correction, and\nalso called her attention to the fact that as I had been appointed\nchief of clinic I was especially anxious to have my name correctly\nprinted in the catalogue. She apologized for her remissness and assured\nme that everything should be as I requested. Imagine my surprise and\nchagrin when on receiving the new catalogue I found that while the\ncorrection had been made in my name I was not listed as chief of\nclinic. When I asked her about this she was quite puzzled; she said\nshe had no idea that I had been appointed chief of clinic. She had to\nconsult the minutes of the faculty, written by herself, before she was\nconvinced of it. It should be noted that as recorder to the faculty it\nwas her duty to know all these things as soon as they transpired.[75]\nWhen she finally ascertained that I was right she was very apologetic\nand informed me that she would at once write to the superintendent of\nthe clinic to inform him of my appointment, something which she should\nhave done months before. Of course I gained nothing by her regrets and\napologies. The catalogue was published and those who read it did not\nfind my name in the desired place. I am chief of clinic in fact but not\nin name. Moreover, as the appointments are made only for one year, it\nis quite likely that my great ambition will never be actually realized.\n\u201cThus the obsessive neologism _cardillac_, which is a condensation\nof _cardiac_, _Cadillac_, and _catalogue_, contains some of the most\nimportant efforts of my medical experience. When I was almost at the\nend of this analysis I suddenly recalled a dream containing this\nneologism cardillac in which my wish was realized. My name appeared\nin its rightful place in the catalogue. The person who showed it to\nme in the dream was Professor Peterson. It was when I was at the\nfirst \u2018crossing\u2019 after I had graduated from the medical college that\nProfessor Peterson urged me to enter the hospital service. About\nfive years later while I was in the state of indecision which I have\ndescribed, it was Professor Peterson who advised me to go to the clinic\nof psychiatry at Zurich where through Bleuler and Jung I first became\nacquainted with Professor Freud and his works, and it was also through\nthe kind recommendation of Dr. Peterson that I was elevated to my\npresent position.\u201d\nI am indebted to Dr. Hitschman for the solution of another case in\nwhich a line of poetry repeatedly obtruded itself on the mind in a\ncertain place without showing any trace of its origin and relation.\nRelated by Dr. E.: \u201cSix years ago I travelled from Biarritz to San\nSebastian. The railroad crosses over the Bidassao--a river which here\nforms the boundary between France and Spain. On the bridge one has a\nsplendid view, on the one side of the broad valley and the Pyrenees\nand on the other of the sea. It was a beautiful, bright summer day;\neverything was filled with sun and light. I was on a vacation and\npleased with my trip to Spain. Suddenly the following words came to me:\n\u2018_But the soul is already free, floating on a sea of light._\u2019\n\u201cAt that time I was trying to remember where these lines came from,\nbut I could not remember; judging by the rhythm, the words must be a\npart of some poem, which, however, entirely escaped my memory. Later\nwhen the verse repeatedly came to my mind, I asked many people about it\nwithout receiving any information.\n\u201cLast year I crossed the same bridge on my return journey from Spain.\nIt was a very dark night and it rained. I looked through the window\nto ascertain whether we had already reached the frontier station\nand noticed that we were on the Bidassao bridge. Immediately the\nabove-cited verse returned to my memory and again I could not recall\nits origin.\n\u201cAt home many months later I found Uhland\u2019s poems. I opened the volume\nand my glance fell upon the verse: \u2018_But the soul is already free,\nfloating on a sea of light_,\u2019 which were the concluding lines of the\npoem entitled \u2018The Pilgrim.\u2019 I read the poem and dimly recalled that\nI had known it many years ago. The scene of action is in Spain, and\nthis seemed to me to be the only relation between the quoted verse and\nthe place on the railroad journey described by me. I was only half\nsatisfied with my discovery and mechanically continued to turn the\npages of the book. On turning the next page I found a poem the title of\nwhich was \u2018_Bidassao Bridge_.\u2019\n\u201cI may add that the contents of this poem seemed even stranger to me\nthan that of the first, and that its first verse read:\n\u201c\u2018On the Bidassao bridge stands a saint grey with age, he blesses to\nthe right the Spanish mountain, to the left he blesses the French\nland.\u2019\u201d\nII. This understanding of the determination of apparently arbitrarily\nselected names, numbers, and words may perhaps contribute to the\nsolution of another problem. As is known, many persons argue against\nthe assumption of an absolute psychic determinism by referring to\nan intense feeling of conviction that there is a free will. This\nfeeling of conviction exists, but is not incompatible with the belief\nin determinism. Like all normal feelings, it must be justified by\nsomething. But, so far as I can observe, it does not manifest itself\nin weighty and important decisions; on these occasions one has much\nmore the feeling of a psychic compulsion and gladly falls back upon it.\n(Compare Luther\u2019s \u201cHere I stand, I cannot do anything else.\u201d)\nOn the other hand, it is in trivial and indifferent decisions that\none feels sure that he could just as easily have acted differently,\nthat he acted of his own free will, and without any motives. From\nour analyses we therefore need not contest the right of the feeling\nof conviction that there is a free will. If we distinguish conscious\nfrom unconscious motivation, we are then informed by the feeling of\nconviction that the conscious motivation does not extend over all our\nmotor resolutions. _Minima non curat pr\u00e6tor._ What is thus left free\nfrom the one side receives its motive from the other side, from the\nunconscious, and the determinism in the psychic realm is thus carried\nout uninterruptedly.[76]\nIII. Although conscious thought must be altogether ignorant of the\nmotivation of the faulty actions described above, yet it would be\ndesirable to discover a psychologic proof of its existence; indeed,\nreasons obtained through a deeper knowledge of the unconscious make it\nprobable that such proofs are to be discovered somewhere. As a matter\nof fact phenomena can be demonstrated in two spheres which seem to\ncorrespond to an unconscious and hence to a displaced knowledge of\nthese motives.\n(_a_)It is a striking and generally to be recognized feature in the\nbehaviour of paranoiacs, that they attach the greatest significance\nto the trivial details in the behaviour of others. Details which are\nusually overlooked by others they interpret and utilize as the basis\nof far-reaching conclusions. For example, the last paranoiac seen by\nme concluded that there was a general understanding among people of\nhis environment, because at his departure from the railway-station\nthey made a certain motion with one hand. Another noticed how people\nwalked on the street, how they brandished their walking-sticks, and the\nlike.[77]\nThe category of the accidental, requiring no motivation, which the\nnormal person lets pass as a part of his own psychic activities and\nfaulty actions, is thus rejected by the paranoiac in the application to\nthe psychic manifestations to others. All that he observes in others is\nfull of meaning, all is explainable. But how does he come to look at it\nin this manner? Probably here as in so many other cases, he projects\ninto the mental life of others what exists in his own unconscious\nactivity. Many things obtrude themselves on consciousness in paranoia\nwhich in normal and neurotic persons can only be demonstrated through\npsychoanalysis as existing in their unconscious.[78] In a certain sense\nthe paranoiac is here justified, he perceives something that escapes\nthe normal person, he sees clearer than one of normal intellectual\ncapacity, but his knowledge becomes worthless when he imputes to\nothers the state of affairs he thus recognizes. I hope that I shall\nnot be expected to justify every paranoic interpretation. But the\npoint which we grant to paranoia in this conception of chance actions\nwill facilitate for us the psychologic understanding of the conviction\nwhich the paranoiac attaches to all these interpretations. _There is\ncertainly some truth to it_; even our errors of judgment, which are\nnot designated as morbid, acquire their feeling of conviction in the\nsame way. This feeling is justified for a certain part of the erroneous\ntrain of thought or for the source of its origin, and we shall later\nextend to it the remaining relationships.\n(_b_) The phenomena of superstition furnish another indication of the\nunconscious motivation in chance and faulty actions. I will make myself\nclear through the discussion of a simple experience which gave me the\nstarting-point to these reflections.\nHaving returned from vacation, my thoughts immediately turned to the\npatients with whom I was to occupy myself in the beginning of my year\u2019s\nwork. My first visit was to a very old woman (see above) for whom I had\ntwice daily performed the same professional services for many years.\nOwing to this monotony unconscious thoughts have often found expression\non the way to the patient and during my occupation with her. She was\nover ninety years old; it was therefore pertinent to ask oneself at the\nbeginning of each year how much longer she was likely to live.\nOn the day of which I speak I was in a hurry and took a carriage to\nher house. Every coachman at the cabstand near my house knew the old\nwoman\u2019s address, as each of them had often driven me there. This day\nit happened that the driver did not stop in front of her house, but\nbefore one of the same number in a near-by and really similar-looking\nparallel street. I noticed the mistake and reproached the coachman, who\napologized for it.\nIs it of any significance when I am taken to a house where the\nold woman is not to be found? Certainly not to me; but were I\n_superstitious_, I should see an omen in this incident, a hint of fate\nthat this would be the last year for the old woman. A great many omens\nwhich have been preserved by history have been founded on no better\nsymbolism. Of course, I explain the incident as an accident without\nfurther meaning.\nThe case would have been entirely different had I come on foot and,\n\u201cabsorbed in thought\u201d or \u201cthrough distraction,\u201d I had gone to the house\nin the parallel street instead of the correct one. I would not explain\nthat as an accident, but as an action with unconscious intent requiring\ninterpretation. My explanation of this \u201clapse in walking\u201d would\nprobably be that I expected that the time would soon come when I should\nnot meet the old woman any longer.\nI therefore differ from a superstitious person in the following\nmanner:--\nI do not believe that an occurrence in which my mental life takes no\npart can teach me anything hidden concerning the future shaping of\nreality; but I do believe that an unintentional manifestation of my own\nmental activity surely contains something concealed which belongs only\nto my mental life--that is, I believe in outer (real) chance, but not\nin inner (psychic) accidents. With the superstitious person the case\nis reversed: he knows nothing of the motive of his chance and faulty\nactions, he believes in the existence of psychic contingencies; he\nis therefore inclined to attribute meaning to external chance, which\nmanifests itself in actual occurrence, and to see in the accident a\nmeans of expression for something hidden outside of him. There are two\ndifferences between me and the superstitious person: first, he projects\nthe motive to the outside, while I look for it in myself; second, he\nexplains the accident by an event which I trace to a thought. What\nhe considers hidden corresponds to the unconscious with me, and the\ncompulsion not to let chance pass as chance, but to explain it as\ncommon to both of us.\nThus I admit that this conscious ignorance and unconscious knowledge of\nthe motivation of psychic accidentalness is one of the psychic roots\nof superstition. _Because_ the superstitious person knows nothing of\nthe motivation of his own accidental actions, and because the fact of\nthis motivation strives for a place in his recognition, he is compelled\nto dispose of them by displacing them into the outer world. If such\na connection exists it can hardly be limited to this single case. As\na matter of fact, I believe that a large portion of the mythological\nconception of the world which reaches far into the most modern\nreligions _is nothing but psychology projected into the outer world_.\nThe dim perception (the endo-psychic perception, as it were) of psychic\nfactors and relations[79] of the unconscious was taken as a model in\nthe construction of a _transcendental reality_, which is destined to be\nchanged again by science into _psychology of the unconscious_.\nIt is difficult to express it in other terms; the analogy to paranoia\nmust here come to our aid. We venture to explain in this way the\nmyths of paradise and the fall of man, of God, of good and evil, of\nimmortality, and the like--that is, to transform _metaphysics_ into\n_meta-psychology_. The gap between the paranoiac\u2019s displacement\nand that of superstition is narrower than appears at first sight.\nWhen human beings began to think, they were obviously compelled to\nexplain the outer world in an anthropomorphic sense by a multitude of\npersonalities in their own image; the accidents which they explained\nsuperstitiously were thus actions and expressions of persons. In\nthat regard they behaved just like paranoiacs, who draw conclusions\nfrom insignificant signs which others give them, and like all\nnormal persons who justly take the unintentional actions of their\nfellow-beings as a basis for the estimation of their characters. Only\nin our modern philosophical, but by no means finished, views of life\ndoes superstition seem so much out of place: in the view of life of\npre-scientific times and nations it was justified and consistent.\nThe Roman who gave up an important undertaking because he sighted\nan ill-omened flock of birds was relatively right; his action was\nconsistent with his principles. But if he withdrew from an undertaking\nbecause he had stumbled on his threshold (_un Romain retournerait_),\nhe was absolutely superior even to us unbelievers. He was a better\npsychologist than we are striving to become. For his stumbling\ncould demonstrate to him the existence of a doubt, an internal\ncounter-current the force of which could weaken the power of his\nintention at the moment of its execution. For only by concentrating\nall psychic forces on the desired aim can one be assured of perfect\nsuccess. How does Schiller\u2019s Tell, who hesitated so long to shoot the\napple from his son\u2019s head, answer the bailiff\u2019s question why he had\nprovided himself with a second arrow?\n\u201c_With the second arrow I would have pierced you had I struck my dear\nchild--and truly, I should not have failed to reach you._\u201d\nIV. Whoever has had the opportunity of studying the concealed psychic\nfeelings of persons by means of psychoanalysis can also tell something\nnew concerning the quality of unconscious motives, which express\nthemselves in superstition. Nervous persons afflicted with compulsive\nthinking and compulsive states, who are often very intelligent, show\nvery plainly that superstition originates from repressed hostile\nand cruel impulses. The greater part of superstition signifies fear\nof impending evil, and he who has frequently wished evil to others,\nbut because of a good bringing-up has repressed the same into the\nunconscious, will be particularly apt to expect punishment for such\nunconscious evil in the form of a misfortune threatening him from\nwithout.\nIf we concede that we have by no means exhausted the psychology of\nsuperstition in these remarks, we must, on the other hand, at least\ntouch upon the question whether real roots of superstition should\nbe altogether denied, whether there are really no omens, prophetic\ndreams, telepathic experiences, manifestations of supernatural forces,\nand the like. I am now far from willing to repudiate without anything\nfurther all these phenomena, concerning which we possess so many minute\nobservations even from men of intellectual prominence, and which\nshould certainly form a basis for further investigation. We may even\nhope that some of these observations will be explained by our present\nknowledge of the unconscious psychic processes without necessitating\nradical changes in our present aspect. If still other phenomena, as,\nfor example, those maintained by the spiritualists, should be proven,\nwe should then consider the modification of our \u201claws\u201d as demanded by\nthe new experience, without becoming confused in regard to the relation\nof things of this world.\nIn the sphere of these analyses I can only answer the questions\nhere proposed subjectively--that is, in accordance with my personal\nexperience. I am sorry to confess that I belong to that class of\nunworthy individuals before whom the spirits cease their activities\nand the supernatural disappears, so that I have never been in\nposition to experience anything personally that would stimulate\nbelief in the miraculous. Like everybody else, I have had forebodings\nand experienced misfortunes; but the two evaded each other, so\nthat nothing followed the foreboding, and the misfortune struck me\nunannounced. When as a young man I lived alone in a strange city I\nfrequently heard my name suddenly pronounced by an unmistakable, dear\nvoice, and I then made a note of the exact moment of the hallucination\nin order to inquire carefully of those at home what had occurred at\nthat time. There was nothing to it. On the other hand, I later worked\namong my patients calmly and without foreboding while my child almost\nbled to death. Nor have I ever been able to recognize as unreal\nphenomena any of the forebodings reported to me by my patients.\nThe belief in prophetic dreams numbers many adherents, because it can\nbe supported by the fact that some things really so happen in the\nfuture as they were previously foretold by the wish of the dream.\nBut in this there is little to be wondered at, as many far-reaching\ndeviations may be regularly demonstrated between a dream and the\nfulfilment which the credulity of the dreamer prefers to neglect.\nA nice example, one which may be justly called prophetic, was\nonce brought to me for exhaustive analysis by an intelligent and\ntruth-loving patient. She related that she once dreamed that she had\nmet a former friend and family physician in front of a certain store\nin a certain street, and next morning when she went down town she\nactually met him at the place named in the dream. I may observe that\nthe significance of this wonderful coincidence was not proven to be due\nto any subsequent event--that is, it could not be justified through\nfuture occurrences.\nCareful examination definitely established the fact that there was no\nproof that the woman recalled the dream in the morning following the\nnight of the dream--that is, before the walk and before the meeting.\nShe could offer no objection when this state of affairs was presented\nin a manner that robbed this episode of everything miraculous, leaving\nonly an interesting psychologic problem. One morning she had walked\nthrough this very street, had met her old family physician before that\ncertain store, and on seeing him received the conviction that during\nthe preceding night she had dreamed of this meeting at this place.\nThe analysis then showed with great probability how she came to\nthis conviction, to which, in accordance with the general rule, we\ncannot deny a certain right to credence. A meeting at a definite\nplace following a previous expectation really describes the fact of a\nrendezvous. The old family physician awakened her memory of old times,\nwhen meetings with a third person, also a friend of the physician, were\nof marked significance to her. Since that time she had continued her\nrelations with this gentleman, and the day before the mentioned dream\nshe had waited for him in vain. If I could report in greater detail the\ncircumstances here before us, I could easily show that the illusion\nof the prophetic dream at the sight of the friend of former times is\nperchance equivalent to the following speech: \u201cAh, doctor, you now\nremind me of bygone times, when I never had to wait in vain for N. when\nwe had arranged a meeting.\u201d\nI have observed in myself a simple and easily explained example, which\nis probably a good model for similar occurrences of those familiar\n\u201cremarkable coincidences\u201d wherein we meet a person of whom we were\njust thinking. During a walk through the inner city a few days after\nthe title of \u201cProfessor\u201d was bestowed on me, which carries with it a\ngreat deal of prestige even in monarchical cities, my thoughts suddenly\nmerged into a childish revenge-fantasy against a certain married\ncouple. Some months previous they had called me to see their little\ndaughter who suffered from an interesting compulsive manifestation\nfollowing the appearance of a dream. I took a great interest in the\ncase, the genesis of which I believed I could surmise, but the parents\nwere unfavourable to my treatment, and gave me to understand that\nthey thought of applying to a foreign authority who cured by means\nof hypnotism. I now fancied that after the failure of this attempt,\nthe parents begged me to resume my treatment, that they now had full\nconfidence in me, etc. But I answered: \u201cNow that I have become a\nprofessor, you have confidence in me. The title has made no change in\nmy ability; if you could not use me when I was instructor you can get\nalong without me now that I am a professor.\u201d At this point my fantasy\nwas interrupted by a loud \u201cGood evening, Professor!\u201d and as I looked up\nthere passed me the same couple on whom I had just taken this imaginary\nvengeance.\nThe next reflection destroyed the semblance of the miraculous. I was\nwalking towards this couple on a straight, almost deserted street;\nglancing up hastily at a distance of perhaps twenty steps from me,\nI had spied and realized their stately personalities; but this\nperception, following the model of a negative hallucination, was set\naside by certain emotionally accentuated motives and then asserted\nitself in the apparently spontaneous emerging fantasy.\nA similar experience is related by Brill, which also throws some light\non the nature of telepathy.\n\u201cWhile engrossed in conversation during our customary Sunday evening\ndinner at one of the large New York restaurants, I suddenly stopped\nand irrelevantly remarked to my wife, \u2018I wonder how Dr. R. is doing\nin Pittsburg.\u2019 She looked at me much astonished and said: \u2018Why, that\nis exactly what I have been thinking for the last few seconds! Either\nyou have transferred this thought to me or I have transferred it to\nyou. How can you otherwise explain this strange phenomenon?\u2019 I had\nto admit that I could offer no solution. Our conversation throughout\nthe dinner showed not the remotest association to Dr. R., nor, so far\nas our memories went, had we heard or spoken of him for some time.\nBeing a sceptic, I refused to admit that there was anything mysterious\nabout it, although inwardly I felt quite uncertain. To be frank, I was\nsomewhat mystified.\n\u201cBut we did not remain very long in this state of mind, for on looking\ntoward the cloak-room we were surprised to see Dr. R. Though closer\ninspection showed our mistake, we were both struck by the remarkable\nresemblance of this stranger to Dr. R. From the position of the\ncloak-room we were forced to conclude that this stranger had passed\nour table. Absorbed in our conversation, we had not noticed him\nconsciously, but the visual image had stirred up the association of his\ndouble, Dr. R. That we should both have experienced the same thought\nis also quite natural. The last word from our friend was to the effect\nthat he had taken up private practice in Pittsburg, and, being aware\nof the vicissitudes that beset the beginner, it was quite natural to\nwonder how fortune smiled upon him.\n\u201cWhat promised to be a supernatural manifestation was thus easily\nexplained on a normal basis; but had we not noticed the stranger before\nhe left the restaurant, it would have been impossible to exclude the\nmysterious. I venture to say that such simple mechanisms are at the\nbottom of the most complicated telepathic manifestations; at least,\nsuch has been my experience in all cases accessible to investigation.\u201d\nAnother \u201csolution of an apparent foreboding\u201d was reported by Otto\nRank[80]:--\n\u201cSome time ago I had experienced a remarkable variation of that\n\u2018peculiar coincidence\u2019 wherein one meets a person who has just been\noccupying one\u2019s thoughts. Shortly before Christmas I went to the\nAustro-Hungarian Bank in order to obtain ten new silver crown-pieces\ndestined for Christmas gifts. Absorbed in ambitious fantasies which\ndealt with the contrast of my meagre means to the enormous sums in the\nbanking-house, I turned into the narrow street to the bank. In front\nof the door I saw an automobile and many people going in and out. I\nthought to myself: \u2018The officials will have plenty of time for my new\ncrowns; naturally I shall be quick about it; I shall put down the paper\nnotes to be exchanged, and say, \u201cPlease give me gold.\u201d\u2019 I realized my\nmistake at once--I was to have asked for _silver_--and awoke from my\nfantasies.\n\u201cI was now only a few steps from the entrance, and noticed a young man\ncoming toward me who looked familiar, but whom I could not definitely\nidentify on account of my short-sightedness. As he came nearer I\nrecognized him as a classmate of my brother whose name was _Gold_ and\nfrom whose brother, a well-known journalist, I had great expectations\nin the beginning of my literary career. But these expectations had not\nmaterialized, and with them had vanished the hoped-for material success\nwith which my fantasies were occupying themselves on my way to the\nbank. Thus engrossed I must have unconsciously perceived the approach\nof Mr. Gold, who impressed himself on my conscience while I was\ndreaming of material success, and thereby caused me to ask the cashier\nfor gold instead of the inferior silver. But, on the other hand, the\nparadoxical fact that my unconscious was able to perceive an object\nlong before it was recognized by the eye might in part be explained by\nthe complex readiness (_Komplexbereitschaft_) of Bleuler. For my mind\nwas attuned to the material, and, contrary to my better knowledge, it\nguided my steps from the very beginning to buildings where gold and\npaper money were exchanged.\u201d\nTo the category of the wonderful and uncanny we may also add that\nstrange feeling we perceive in certain moments and situations when it\nseems as if we had already had exactly the same experience, or had\npreviously found ourselves in the same situation. Yet we are never\nsuccessful in our efforts to recall clearly those former experiences\nand situations. I know that I follow only the loose colloquial\nexpression when I designate that which stimulates us in such moments as\na \u201cfeeling.\u201d We undoubtedly deal with a judgment, and, indeed, with a\njudgment of cognition; but these cases, nevertheless, have a character\npeculiar to themselves, and besides, we must not ignore the fact that\nwe never recall what we are seeking.\nI do not know whether this phenomenon of _D\u00e9j\u00e0 vu_ was ever seriously\noffered as a proof of a former psychic existence of the individual; but\nit is certain that psychologists have taken an interest in it, and have\nattempted to solve the riddle in a multitude of speculative ways. None\nof the proposed tentative explanations seems right to me, because none\ntakes account of anything but the accompanying manifestations and the\nfavouring conditions of the phenomenon. Those psychic processes which,\naccording to my observation, are alone responsible for the explanation\nof the _D\u00e9j\u00e0 vu_--namely, the unconscious fantasies--are generally\nneglected by the psychologists even to-day.\nI believe that it is wrong to designate the feeling of having\nexperienced something before as an illusion. On the contrary, in such\nmoments something is really touched that we have already experienced,\nonly we cannot consciously recall the latter because it never was\nconscious. In short, the feeling of _D\u00e9j\u00e0 vu_ corresponds to the memory\nof an unconscious fantasy. There are unconscious fantasies (or day\ndreams) just as there are similar conscious creations, which every one\nknows from personal experience.\nI realize that the object is worthy of most minute study, but I will\nhere give the analysis of only one case of _D\u00e9j\u00e0 vu_ in which the\nfeeling was characterized by particular intensity and persistence.\nA woman of thirty-seven years asserted that she most distinctly\nremembered that at the age of twelve and a half she paid her first\nvisit to some school friends in the country, and as she entered the\ngarden she immediately had the feeling of having been there before.\nThis feeling was repeated as she went through the living-rooms, so that\nshe believed she knew beforehand how big the next room was, what views\none could have on looking out of it, etc. But the belief that this\nfeeling of recognition might have its source in a previous visit to\nthe house and garden, perhaps a visit paid in earliest childhood, was\nabsolutely excluded and disproved by statements from her parents. The\nwoman who related this sought no psychologic explanation, but saw in\nthe appearance of this feeling a prophetic reference to the importance\nwhich these friends later assumed in her emotional life. On taking into\nconsideration, however, the circumstance under which this phenomenon\npresented itself to her, we found the way to another conception.\nWhen she decided upon this visit she knew that these girls had an only\nbrother, who was seriously ill. In the course of the visit she actually\nsaw him. She found him looking very badly, and thought to herself that\nhe would soon die. But it happened that her own only brother had had a\nserious attack of diphtheria some months before, and during his illness\nshe had lived for weeks with relatives far from her parental home. She\nbelieved that her brother was taking part in this visit to the country,\nimagined even that this was his first long journey since his illness;\nstill, her memory was remarkably indistinct in regard to these points,\nwhereas all other details, and particularly the dress which she wore\nthat day, remained most clearly before her eyes.\nTo the initiated it will not be difficult to conclude from these\nsuggestions that the expectation of her brother\u2019s death had played a\ngreat part in the girl\u2019s mind at that time, and that either it never\nbecame conscious or it was more energetically repressed after the\nfavourable issue of the illness. Under other circumstances she would\nhave been compelled to wear another dress--namely, mourning clothes.\nShe found the analogous situation in her friends\u2019 home; their only\nbrother was in danger of an early death, an event that really came\nto pass a short time after. She might have consciously remembered\nthat she had lived through a similar situation a few months previous,\nbut instead of recalling what was inhibited through repression she\ntransferred the memory feeling to the locality, to the garden, and the\nhouse, and merged it into the _fausse reconnaissance_ that she had\nalready seen everything exactly as it was.\nFrom the fact of the repression we may conclude that the former\nexpectation of the death of her brother was not far from evincing the\ncharacter of a wish-fantasy. She would then have become the only child.\nIn her later neurosis she suffered in the most intense manner from the\nfear of losing her parents, behind which the analysis disclosed, as\nusual, the unconscious wish of the same content.\nMy own experience of _D\u00e9j\u00e0 vu_ I can trace in a similar manner to the\nemotional constellation of the moment. It may be expressed as follows:\n\u201cThat would be another occasion for awakening certain fantasies\n(unconscious and unknown) which were formed in me at one time or\nanother as a wish to improve my situation.\u201d[81]\nV. Recently when I had occasion to recite to a colleague of a\nphilosophical turn of mind some examples of name-forgetting, with their\nanalyses, he hastened to reply: \u201cThat is all very well, but with me the\nforgetting of a name proceeds in a different manner.\u201d Evidently one\ncannot dismiss this question as simply as that; I do not believe that\nmy colleague had ever thought of an analysis for the forgetting of a\nname, nor could he say how the process differed in him. But his remark,\nnevertheless, touches upon a problem which many would be inclined to\nplace in the foreground. Does the solution given for faulty and chance\nactions apply in general or only in particular cases, and if only in\nthe latter, what are the conditions under which it may also be employed\nin the explanation of the other phenomena?\nIn answer to this question my experiences leave me in the lurch. I can\nonly urge against considering the demonstrated connections as rare, for\nas often as I have made the test in myself and with my patients it was\nalways definitely demonstrated exactly as in the examples reported,\nor there were at least good reasons to assume this. One should not be\nsurprised, however, when one does not succeed every time in finding the\nconcealed meaning of the symptomatic action, as the amount of inner\nresistances ranging themselves against the solution must be considered\na deciding factor. Also it is not always possible to explain every\nindividual dream of one\u2019s self or of patients. To substantiate the\ngeneral validity of the theory, it is enough if one can penetrate only\na certain distance into the hidden associations. The dream which proves\nrefractory when the solution is attempted on the following day can\noften be robbed of its secret a week or a month later, when the psychic\nfactors combating one another have been reduced as a consequence of a\nreal change that has meanwhile taken place. The same applies to the\nsolution of faulty and symptomatic actions. It would therefore be wrong\nto affirm of all cases which resist analysis that they are caused by\nanother psychic mechanism than that here revealed; such assumption\nrequires more than negative proofs; moreover, the readiness to believe\nin a different explanation of faulty and symptomatic actions, which\nprobably exists universally in all normal persons, does not prove\nanything; it is obviously an expression of the same psychic forces\nwhich produced the secret, which therefore strives to protect and\nstruggle against its elucidation.\nOn the other hand, we must not overlook the fact that the repressed\nthoughts and feelings are not independent in attaining expression in\nsymptomatic and faulty actions. The technical possibility for such\nan adjustment of the innervations must be furnished independently\nof them, and this is then gladly utilized by the intention of the\nrepressed material to come to conscious expression. In the case of\nlinguistic faulty actions an attempt has been made by philosophers and\nphilologists to verify through minute observations what structural and\nfunctional relations enter into the service of such intention. If in\nthe determinations of faulty and symptomatic actions we separate the\nunconscious motive from its co-active physiological and psychophysical\nrelations, the question remains open whether there are still other\nfactors within normal limits which, like the unconscious motive, and in\nits place can produce faulty and symptomatic actions on the road of the\nrelations. It is not my task to answer this question.\nVI. Since the discussion of speech blunders we have been content to\ndemonstrate that faulty actions have a concealed motive, and through\nthe aid of psychoanalysis we have traced our way to the knowledge of\ntheir motivation. The general nature and the peculiarities of the\npsychic factors brought to expression in these faulty actions we have\nhitherto left almost without consideration; at any rate, we have not\nattempted to define them more accurately or to examine into their\nlawfulness. Nor will we now attempt a thorough elucidation of the\nsubject, as the first steps have already taught us that it is more\nfeasible to enter this structure from another side. Here we can put\nbefore ourselves certain questions which I will cite in their order.\n(1) What is the content and the origin of the thoughts and feelings\nwhich show themselves through faulty and chance actions? (2) What are\nthe conditions which force a thought or a feeling to make use of these\noccurrences as a means of expression and place it in a position to do\nso? (3) Can constant and definite associations be demonstrated between\nthe manner of the faulty action and the qualities brought to expression\nthrough it?\nI shall begin by bringing together some material for answering the last\nquestion. In the discussion of the examples of speech blunders we found\nit necessary to go beyond the contents of the intended speech, and we\nhad to seek the cause of the speech disturbance outside the intention.\nThe latter was quite clear in a series of cases, and was known to the\nconsciousness of the speaker. In the example that seemed most simple\nand transparent it was a similar sounding but different conception of\nthe same thought, which disturbed its expression without any one being\nable to say why the one succumbed and the other came to the surface\n(Meringer and Mayers\u2019 _Contaminations_).\nIn a second group of cases one conception succumbed to a motive which\ndid not, however, prove strong enough to cause complete submersion. The\nconception which was withheld was clearly presented to consciousness.\nOnly of the third group can we affirm unreservedly that the disturbing\nthought differed from the one intended, and it is obvious that it\nmay establish an essential distinction. The disturbing thought is\neither connected with the disturbed one through a thought association\n(disturbance through inner contradiction), or it is substantially\nstrange to it, and just the disturbed word is connected with the\ndisturbing thought through a surprising outer association, which is\nfrequently unconscious.\nIn the examples which I have given from my psychoanalyses it is found\nthat the entire speech is either under the influence of thoughts which\nhave become active simultaneously, or under absolutely unconscious\nthoughts which betray themselves either through the disturbance itself,\nor which evince an indirect influence by making it possible for the\nindividual parts of the unconsciously intended speech to disturb\none another. The retained or unconscious thoughts from which the\ndisturbances in speech emanate are of most varied origin. A general\nsurvey does not reveal any definite direction.\nComparative examinations of examples of mistakes in reading and writing\nlead to the same conclusions. Isolated cases, as in speech blunders,\nseem to owe their origin to an unmotivated work of condensation\n(_e.g._, the _Apel_). But we should be pleased to know whether special\nconditions must not be fulfilled in order that such condensation,\nwhich is considered regular in the dream-work and faulty in our waking\nthoughts, should take place. No information concerning this can be\nobtained from the examples themselves. But I merely refuse from this\nto draw the conclusion that there are no such conditions, as, for\ninstance, the relaxation of conscious attention; for I have learned\nelsewhere that automatic actions are especially characterized by\ncorrectness and reliability. I would rather emphasize the fact that\nhere, as so frequently in biology, it is the normal relations, or\nthose approaching the normal, that are less favourable objects for\ninvestigation than the pathological. What remains obscure in the\nexplanation of these most simple disturbances will, according to my\nexpectation, be made clear through the explanation of more serious\ndisturbances.\nAlso mistakes in reading and writing do not lack examples in which more\nremote and more complicated motivation can be recognized.\nThere is no doubt that the disturbances of the speech functions occur\nmore easily and make less demand on the disturbing forces than other\npsychic acts.\nBut one is on different ground when it comes to the examination of\nforgetting in the literal sense--_i.e._, the forgetting of past\nexperiences. (To distinguish this forgetting from the others we\ndesignate _sensu strictiori_ the forgetting of proper names and\nforeign words, as in Chapters I and II, as \u201cslips\u201d; and the forgetting\nof resolutions as \u201comissions.\u201d) The principal conditions of the\nnormal process in forgetting are unknown.[82] We are also reminded\nof the fact that not all is forgotten which we believe to be. Our\nexplanation here deals only with those cases in which the forgetting\narouses our astonishment, in so far as it infringes the rule that\nthe unimportant is forgotten, while the important matter is guarded\nby memory. Analysis of these examples of forgetting which seem to\ndemand a special explanation shows that the motive of forgetting is\nalways an unwillingness to recall something which may evoke painful\nfeelings. We come to the conjecture that this motive universally\nstrives for expression in psychic life, but is inhibited through other\nand contrary forces from regularly manifesting itself. The extent and\nsignificance of this dislike to recall painful impressions seems worthy\nof the most painstaking psychologic investigation. The question as\nto what special conditions render possible the universally resistant\nforgetting in individual cases cannot be solved through this added\nassociation.\nA different factor steps into the foreground in the forgetting of\nresolutions; the supposed conflict resulting in the repression of the\npainful memory becomes tangible, and in the analysis of the examples\none regularly recognizes a counter-will which opposes but does not put\nan end to the resolution. As in previously discussed faulty acts, we\nhere also recognize two types of the psychic process: the counter-will\neither turns directly against the resolution (in intentions of some\nconsequence) or it is substantially foreign to the resolution itself\nand establishes its connection with it through an outer association (in\nalmost indifferent resolutions).\nThe same conflict governs the phenomena of erroneously carried-out\nactions. The impulse which manifests itself in the disturbances of the\naction is frequently a counter-impulse. Still oftener it is altogether\na strange impulse which only utilizes the opportunity to express itself\nthrough a disturbance in the execution of the action. The cases in\nwhich the disturbance is the result of an inner contradiction are the\nmost significant ones, and also deal with the more important activities.\nThe inner conflict in the chance or symptomatic actions then merges\ninto the background. Those motor expressions which are least thought\nof, or are entirely overlooked by consciousness, serve as the\nexpression of numerous unconscious or restrained feelings. For the most\npart they represent symbolically wishes and phantoms.\nThe first question (as to the origin of the thoughts and emotions\nwhich find expression in faulty actions) we can answer by saying\nthat in a series of cases the origin of the disturbing thoughts can\nbe readily traced to repressed emotions of the psychic life. Even in\nhealthy persons egotistic, jealous and hostile feelings and impulses,\nburdened by the pressure of moral education, often utilize the path of\nfaulty actions to express in some way their undeniably existing force\nwhich is not recognized by the higher psychic instances. Allowing\nthese faulty and chance actions to continue corresponds in great\npart to a comfortable toleration of the unmoral. The manifold sexual\ncurrents play no insignificant part in these repressed feelings. That\nthey appear so seldom in the thoughts revealed by the analyses of\nmy examples is simply a matter of coincidence. As I have undertaken\nthe analyses of numerous examples from my own psychic life, the\nselection was partial from the first, and aimed at the exclusion of\nsexual matters. At other times it seemed that the disturbing thoughts\noriginated from the most harmless objection and consideration.\nWe have now reached the answer to the second question--that is, what\npsychologic conditions are responsible for the fact that a thought\nmust seek expression, not in its complete form but, as it were, in\nparasitic form, as a modification and disturbance of another. From\nthe most striking examples of faulty actions it is quite obvious that\nthis determinant should be sought in a relation to conscious capacity,\nor in the more or less firmly pronounced character of the \u201crepressed\u201d\nmaterial. But an examination of this series of examples shows that\nthis character consists of many indistinct elements. The tendency to\noverlook something because it is wearisome, or because the concerned\nthought does not really belong to the intended matter--these feelings\nseem to play the same r\u00f4le as motives for the suppression of a thought\n(which later depends for expression on the disturbance of another), as\nthe moral condemnation of a rebellious emotional feeling, or as the\norigin of absolutely unconscious trains of thought. An insight into the\ngeneral nature of the condition of faulty and chance actions cannot be\ngained in this way.\nHowever, this investigation gives us one single significant fact; the\nmore harmless the motivation of the faulty act the less obnoxious,\nand hence the less incapable of consciousness, the thought to which\nit gives expression is; the easier also becomes the solution of the\nphenomenon after we have turned our attention toward it. The simplest\ncases of speech blunders are immediately noticed and spontaneously\ncorrected. Where one deals with motivation through actually repressed\nfeelings the solution requires a painstaking analysis, which may\nsometimes strike against difficulties or turn out unsuccessful.\nOne is therefore justified in taking the result of this last\ninvestigation as an indication of the fact that the satisfactory\nexplanation of the psychologic determinations of faulty and chance\nactions is to be acquired in another way and from another source.\nThe indulgent reader can therefore see in these discussions the\ndemonstration of the surfaces of fracture in which this theme was quite\nartificially evolved from a broader connection.\nVII. Just a few words to indicate the direction of this broader\nconnection. The mechanism of the faulty and chance actions, as we\nhave learned to know it through the application of analysis, shows in\nthe most essential points an agreement with the mechanism of dream\nformation, which I have discussed in the chapter \u201cThe Dream Work\u201d of\nmy book on the interpretation of dreams. Here, as there, one finds\nthe condensation and compromise formation (\u201ccontaminations\u201d); in\naddition the situation is much the same, since unconscious thoughts\nfind expression as modifications of other thoughts in unusual ways\nand through outer associations. The incongruities, absurdities, and\nerrors in the dream content by virtue of which the dream is scarcely\nrecognized as a psychic achievement originate in the same way--to be\nsure, through freer usage of the existing material--as the common error\nof our everyday life; _here, as there, the appearance of the incorrect\nfunction is explained through the peculiar interference of two or more\ncorrect actions_.\nAn important conclusion can be drawn from, this combination: the\npeculiar mode of operation, whose most striking function we recognize\nin the dream content, should not be adjudged only to the sleeping state\nof the psychic life when we possess abundant proof of its activity\nduring the waking state in the form of faulty actions. The same\nconnection also forbids us assuming that these psychic processes which\nimpress us as abnormal and strange are determined by deep-seated decay\nof psychic activity or by morbid state of function.[83]\nThe correct understanding of this strange psychic work which allows\nthe faulty actions to originate like the dream pictures will only be\npossible after we have discovered that the psychoneurotic symptoms,\nparticularly the psychic formations of hysteria and compulsion\nneurosis, repeat in their mechanisms all the essential features of\nthis mode of operation. The continuation of our investigation would\ntherefore have to begin at this point.\nThere is still another special interest for us in considering the\nfaulty, chance, and symptomatic actions in the light of this last\nanalogy. If we compare them to the function of the psychoneuroses and\nthe neurotic symptoms, two frequently recurring statements gain in\nsense and support--namely, that the border-line between the nervous,\nnormal, and abnormal states is indistinct, and that we are all slightly\nnervous. Regardless of all medical experience, one may construe various\ntypes of such barely suggested nervousness, the _formes frustes_ of the\nneuroses. There may be cases in which only a few symptoms appear, or\nthey may manifest themselves rarely or in mild forms; the extenuation\nmay be transferred to the number, intensity, or to the temporal\noutbreak of the morbid manifestation. It may also happen that just\nthis type, which forms the most frequent transition between health and\ndisease, may never be discovered. The transition type, whose morbid\nmanifestations come in the form of faulty and symptomatic actions, is\ncharacterized by the fact that the symptoms are transformed to the\nleast important psychic activities, while everything that can lay claim\nto a higher psychic value remains free from disturbance. When the\nsymptoms are disposed of in a reverse manner--that is, when they appear\nin the most important individual and social activities in a manner to\ndisturb the functions of nourishment and sexual relations, professional\nand social life--such disposition is found in the severe cases of\nneuroses, and is perhaps more characteristic of the latter than the\nmultiformity or vividness of the morbid manifestations.\nBut the common character of the mildest as well as the severest cases,\nto which the faulty and chance actions contribute, lies _in the ability\nto refer the phenomena to unwelcome, repressed, psychic material,\nwhich, though pushed away from consciousness, is nevertheless not\nrobbed of all capacity to express itself_.\nINDEX\nActions--\nAccidental, 192\nChance, 215\nSymbolic, 210\nSymptomatic, 178, 215, 235\nCollection of, 238\nExamples, 216, 217\nGrouping of, 219\nAdler, 283, 287\nAmnesia, 139\nInfantile, 62\nTemporary, 35\nAnalysis of--\nAliquis, 18\nCastelvetrano, 50\nOde to Apollo, 29\nSignorelli, 4\nYoung, 44\nAnticipations, 72\nAssociation, 11\nAuditifs, 63\nAwkwardness, accidental, 209\nBed-wetting, 150\nBehaviour of paranoiacs, 304\nBernheim, 161\nBleuler, 38, 120, 303, 319\nBlood miracle, 20\nBlunders, speech, 74\nBoileau, quoted from, 114\nBrant\u00f4me, 93\nBreaking of objects, 184, 186, 187, 189\nBrill, 19, 29, 32, 101, 102, 103, 130, 147, 169, 170, 197, 241, 249,\n258, 293, 316\nChance, 277\nChance numbers, 282, 283\nCharcot, 63, 157\nChild, intellectual accomplishments of, 62\nChildhood activities, trace of, 62\nCombined faulty acts, 265\nExamples of, 266, 267\nComplex--\nAmbition, 100\nFamily, 40\n\u0152dipus, 198\nPersonal, 38, 49\nProfessional, 40\nSelf-reference, 52\nCompromise formation, examples of, 81\nConsciousness, 10\nBringing hidden ideas to, 19\nContaminations, 72\nContradiction from repression, 26\nCounter-will, 170\nIn resolutions, 170\nDamaging things, 190, 191\nDarwin, 154\nDattner, B., 129, 232, 233, 239\nDaudet, 156\nDeath and sexuality, 7\n_D\u00e9j\u00e0 vu_--\nExplanation of, 321\nPhenomenon of, 320\nDelusions, formation of, 155\nDenials, 149\nDeterminant, inner, 13\nDeterminism, 277\nIn mental life, 278\nPsychic, 302\nDisplacement, 4, 10, 57\nRetro-active, 58\nDisturbance of newly emerging theme, 6\nDon Quixote, 202\nDream, prophetic, 312\nElement, suppressed, 11\nErroneously carried-out actions, 177, 278, 332\nAs an expression of self-reproach, 184\nExamples of, 178, 179, 180\nErrors, 249\nExamples of, 250, 251, 253\nOf memory, 249\nMechanism of, 256\nExamples arbitrarily chosen, 279, 281\nFall, 191\nFalse recollection, 4\nFaulty acts, 192\nActions, 326\nFaulty actions--\nExplanation of, 322\nIn relation to nervousness, 337\nThe psychoneurotic symptom, 337\nMemory, mechanism of, 10\nRelation to the dream, 335\nFerenczi, 33, 43, 46, 98, 204, 324\nFolk-lore, 154\nForebodings, 312\nFore-sounds, influence of, 78\nForget, disposition to, 11\nTendency to, 17\nForgetfulness, 168\nDue to disturbances of pain, 27\nExcusing power of, 165\nPsychic mechanism of, 3\nTemporary, of proper names, 3, 29, 45\nForgetting--\nAs a spontaneous process, 135\nDefensive tendency of, 153\nExamples of, 139, 140, 141, 148, 149\nIntentional, 8\nMechanism of, 52, 330\nOf experiences, 138\nOf foreign words, 17\nOf impressions, 135, 138\nOf intentions, 159\nOf knowledge, 139\nOf names, 29, 39, 40, 155, 324\nOf resolutions, 135, 173, 332\nPain motive of, 155\nPreference for proper names, 3, 4, 11\nPsychologic analysis of, 136\nPurposive, 24\nThe order of words, 29, 33, 34\nThrough neglect, 163\nFree will, 303\nFreud, 43, 300\nGross, Hans, 154, 304\nHallucination, 313\nHenri V. and C., 61\nHitschman, 301\nIdentification, 100\nImpotence, psychic, 34\nInjury, self-inflicted, 199, 201\nIntention, 159\nIntentions--\nForgetting of, 160\nSecondary, 163\nInterchangings, 72\nJones, E., 31, 51, 97, 109, 127, 129, 148, 151, 155, 163, 179, 221,\n239, 267, 290, 292\nJung, C.

Brill, The Macmillan Company, New York, and Allen, London.]\n[Footnote 3: Finer observation reduces somewhat the contrast between\nthe analyses of _Signorelli_ and _aliquis_ as far as the substitutive\nrecollections are concerned. Here, too, the forgetting seems to be\naccompanied by substitutive formations. When I later asked my companion\nwhether in his effort to recall the forgotten word he did not think of\nsome substitution, he informed me that he was at first tempted to put\nan ab into the verse: _nostris ab ossibus_ (perhaps the disjointed part\nof _a-liquis_) and that later the word _exoriare_ obtruded itself with\nparticular distinctness and persistency. Being sceptical, he added that\nit was apparently due to the fact that it was the first word of the\nverse. But when I asked him to focus his attention on the associations\nto _exoriare_ he gave me the word _exorcism_. This makes me think that\nthe reinforcement of _exoriare_ in the reproduction has really the\nvalue of such substitution. It probably came through the association\n_exorcism_ from the names of the saints. However, those are refinements\nupon which no value need be laid. It seems now quite possible that\nthe appearance of any kind of substitutive recollection is a constant\nsign--perhaps only characteristic and misleading--of the purposive\nforgetting motivated by repression. This substitution might also exist\nin the reinforcement of an element akin to the thing forgotten, even\nwhere incorrect substitutive names fail to appear. Thus, in the example\nSignorelli, as long as the name of the painter remained inaccessible\nto me, I had more than a clear visual memory of the cycle of his\nfrescoes, and of the picture of himself in the corner; at least it was\nmore intensive than any of my other visual memory traces. In another\ncase, also reported in my essay of 1898, I had hopelessly forgotten\nthe street name and address connected with a disagreeable visit in\na strange city, but--as if to mock me--the house number appeared\nespecially vivid, whereas the memory of numbers usually causes me the\ngreatest difficulty.]\n[Footnote 4: I am not fully convinced of the lack of an inner\nconnection between the two streams of thought in the case of\n_Signorelli_. In carefully following the repressed thought concerning\nthe theme of death and sexual life, one does strike an idea which shows\na near relation to the theme of the frescoes of _Orvieto_.]\n[Footnote 5: _The Psychology of Dementia Pr\u00e6cox_, translated by F.\nPeterson and A.

I shall cite here\nsome excellent observations concerning the forgetting of names from the\nworks of Professor E. Jones, of Toronto: _Papers on Psycho-analysis_,\nchap. iii. p. 49:--\n\u201cFew people can avoid feeling a twinge of resentment when they find\nthat their name has been forgotten, particularly if it is by some one\nwith whom they had hoped or expected it would be remembered. They\ninstinctively realize that if they had made a greater impression on the\nperson\u2019s mind he would certainly have remembered them again, for the\nname is an integral part of the personality. Similarly, few things are\nmore flattering to most people than to find themselves addressed by\nname by a great personage where they could hardly have anticipated it.\nNapoleon, like most leaders of men, was a master of this art. In the\nmidst of the disastrous campaign of France in 1814, he gave an amazing\nproof of his memory in this direction. When in a town near Craonne, he\nrecollected that he had met the mayor, De Bussy, over twenty years ago\nin the La F\u00e8re Regiment. The delighted De Bussy at once threw himself\ninto his service with extraordinary zeal. Conversely, there is no surer\nway of affronting some one than by pretending to forget his name; the\ninsinuation is thus conveyed that the person is so unimportant in our\neyes that we cannot be bothered to remember his name. This device is\noften exploited in literature. In Turgentev\u2019s _Smoke_ (p. 255) the\nfollowing passage occurs: \u201c\u2018So you still find Baden entertaining,\nM\u2019sieur--Litvinov.\u2019 Ratmirov always uttered Litvinov\u2019s surname with\nhesitation, every time, as though he had forgotten it, and could not at\nonce recall it. In this way, as well as by the lofty flourish of his\nhat in saluting him, he meant to insult his pride.\u201d The same author,\nin his _Fathers and Children_ (p. 107), writes: \u201cThe Governor invited\nKirsanov and Bazarov to his ball, and within a few minutes invited them\na second time, regarding them as brothers, and calling them Kisarov.\u201d\nHere the forgetting that he had spoken to them, the mistake in the\nnames, and the inability to distinguish between the two young men,\nconstitute a culmination of disparagement. Falsification of a name has\nthe same signification as forgetting it; it is only a step towards\ncomplete amnesia.\u201d]\n[Footnote 21: _Zentralb. f. Psychoanalyse_, ii., Jahrg. I.

In\nthe anamneses which parents give about their neurotic daughters, it is\nhardly possible to distinguish with any degree of certainty the portion\nforgotten from that hidden, for anything that stands in the way of the\ngirl\u2019s future marriage is systematically set aside by the parents,\nthat is, it becomes repressed. A man who had recently lost his beloved\nwife from an affection of the lungs reported to me the following case\nof misleading the doctor, which can only be explained by the theory\nof such forgetting. \u201cAs my poor wife\u2019s pleuritis had not disappeared\nafter many weeks, Dr. P. was called in consultation. While taking the\nhistory he asked among others the customary questions whether there\nwere any cases of lung trouble in my wife\u2019s family. My wife denied any\nsuch cases, and even I myself could not remember any. While Dr. P.\nwas taking leave the conversation accidentally turned to excursions,\nand my wife said: \u2018Yes, even to Landgersdorf, where my poor brother\nlies buried, is a long journey.\u2019 This brother died about fifteen years\nago, after having suffered for years from tuberculosis. My wife was\nvery fond of him, and often spoke about him. Indeed, I recall that\nwhen her malady was diagnosed as pleurisy she was very worried and\nsadly remarked: \u2018My brother also died of lung trouble.\u2019 But the memory\nwas so very repressed that even after the above-cited conversation\nabout the trip to L. she found no occasion to correct her information\nconcerning the diseases in her family. I myself was struck by this\nforgetting at the very moment she began to talk about Landgersdorf.\u201d A\nperfectly analogous experience is related by Ernest Jones in his work.\nA physician whose wife suffered from some obscure abdominal malady\nremarked to her: \u201cIt is comforting to think that there has been no\ntuberculosis in your family.\u201d She turned to him very astonished and\nsaid, \u201cHave you forgotten that my mother died of tuberculosis, and that\nmy sister recovered from it only after having been given up by the\ndoctors?\u201d]\n[Footnote 33: During the days when I was first writing these pages\nthe following almost incredible case of forgetting happened to me. On\nthe 1st of January I examined my notes so that I could send out my\nbills. In the month of June I came across the name M----l, and could\nnot recall the person to whom it belonged. My surprise increased when\nI observed from my books that I treated the case in a sanatorium, and\nthat for weeks I had called on the patient daily. A patient treated\nunder such conditions is rarely forgotten by a physician in six\nmonths. I asked myself if it could have been a man--a paretic--a case\nwithout interest? Finally, the note about the fee received brought to\nmy memory all the knowledge which strove to elude it. M----l was a\nfourteen-year-old girl, the most remarkable case of my latter years, a\ncase which taught me a lesson I am not likely ever to forget, a case\nwhose upshot gave me many painful hours. The child became afflicted\nwith an unmistakable hysteria, which quickly and thoroughly improved\nunder my care. After this improvement the child was taken away from\nme by the parents. She still complained of abdominal pains which had\nplayed the part in the hysterical symptoms. Two months later she\ndied of sarcoma of the abdominal glands. The hysteria, to which she\nwas greatly predisposed, took the tumour-formation as a provocative\nagent, and I, fascinated by the tumultuous but harmless manifestations\nof hysteria, perhaps overlooked the first sign of the insidious and\nincurable disease.]\n[Footnote 34: A. Pick (\u201cZur Psychologie des Vergessens bei Geistes- und\nNervenkranken,\u201d _Archiv. f. Kriminal-Anthropologie u. Kriminalistik_,\nvon H. Gross) has recently collected a number of authors who realize\nthe value of the influence of the affective factors on memory, and who\nmore or less clearly recognize that a defensive striving against pain\ncan lead to forgetting. But none of us has been able to represent this\nphenomenon and its psychologic determination as exhaustively, and at\nthe same time as effectively, as Nietzsche in one of his aphorisms\n(_Jenseits von Gut und B\u00f6se_, ii., _Hauptst\u00fcck_ 68): \u201c\u2018I have done\nthat,\u2019 says my Memory. \u2018I could not have done that,\u2019 says my Pride, and\nremains inexorable. Finally, my Memory yields.\u201d]\n[Footnote 35: Cf. Hans Gross, _Kriminal Psychologie_, 1898.]\n[Footnote 36: Darwin on forgetting. In Darwin\u2019s autobiography one finds\nthe following passage that does equal credit to his scientific honesty\nand his psychologic acumen: \u201cI had during many years followed a golden\nrule, namely, that whenever a published fact, a new observation or\nthought, came across me which was opposed to my general results, to\nmake a memorandum of it without fail and at once; for I had found by\nexperience that such facts and thoughts were far more apt to escape\nfrom the memory than favourable ones\u201d (quoted by Jones, _loc. cit._, p.\n38).]\n[Footnote 37: Cf. Bernheim, _Neue Studien \u00fcber Hypnotismus, Suggestion\nund Psychotherapie_, 1892.]\n[Footnote 38: Young men of education who can pass the examination and\npay for their maintenance serve one instead of two years\u2019 compulsory\nservice.]\n[Footnote 39: In Bernard Shaw\u2019s _C\u00e6sar and Cleopatra_, C\u00e6sar\u2019s\nindifference to Cleopatra is depicted by his being vexed on leaving\nEgypt at having forgotten to do something. He finally recollected what\nhe had forgotten--to take leave of Cleopatra--this, to be sure, is in\nfull accord with historical truth. How little C\u00e6sar thought of the\nlittle Egyptian princess! Cited from Jones, _loc. cit._, p. 50.]\n[Footnote 40: Women, with their fine understanding of unconscious\nmental processes, are, as a rule, more apt to take offence when we do\nnot recognize them in the street, and hence do not greet them, than\nto accept the most obvious explanation, namely, that the dilatory one\nis short-sighted or so engrossed in thought that he did not see them.\nThey conclude that they surely would have been noticed if they had been\nconsidered of any consequence.]\n[Footnote 41: Dr. Ferenczi reports that he was a distracted person\nhimself, and was considered peculiar by his friends on account of\nthe frequency and strangeness of his failing. But the signs of this\ninattention have almost all disappeared since he began to practise\npsychoanalysis with patients, and was forced to turn his attention\nto the analysis of his own ego. He believes that one renounces\nthese failings when one learns to extend by so much one\u2019s own\nresponsibilities. He therefore justly maintains that distractedness\nis a state which depends on unconscious complexes, and is curable by\npsychoanalysis. One day he was reproaching himself for having committed\na technical error in the psychoanalysis of a patient, and on this day\nall his former distractions reappeared. He stumbled while walking in\nthe street (a representation of that _faux pas_ in the treatment), he\nforgot his pocket-book at home, he was a penny short in his car fare,\nhe did not properly button his clothes, etc.]\n[Footnote 42: E. Jones remarks regarding this: \u201cOften the resistance is\nof a general order. Thus a busy man forgets to mail a letter entrusted\nto him--to his slight annoyance--by his wife, just as he may \u2018forget\u2019\nto carry out her shopping orders.\u201d]\n[Footnote 43: For the sake of the unity of the theme I may here digress\nfrom the accepted classification, and add that the human memory evinces\na particular partiality in regard to money matters. False reminiscences\nof having already paid something are often very obstinate, as I know\nfrom personal experience. When free sway is given to avaricious intent\noutside of the serious interests of life, when it is indulged in in\nthe spirit of fun, as in card playing, we then find that the most\nhonourable men show an inclination to errors, mistakes in memory and\naccounts, and without realizing how, they even find themselves involved\nin small frauds. Such liberties depend in no small part also on the\npsychically refreshing character of the play. The saying that in play\nwe can learn a person\u2019s character may be admitted if we can add \u201cthe\nrepressed character.\u201d If waiters ever make unintentional mistakes\nthey are apparently due to the same mechanism. Among merchants we\ncan frequently observe a certain delay in the paying out of sums of\nmoney, in payments of bills and the like, which brings the owner no\nprofit and can be only understood psychologically as the expression\nof a counter-will against giving out money. Brill sums it up with\nepigrammatic keenness: \u201cWe are more apt to mislay letters containing\nbills than cheques\u201d (Brill, _Psychanalysis, its Theories and Practical\nApplication_, p. 197).]\n[Footnote 44: Translated by A. A.

Formerly, it was\na customary sign of mourning, at other times it expressed itself in\nideas of piety and renunciation of the world.]\n[Footnote 51: The case is then identical with a sexual attack on a\nwoman, in whom the attack of the man cannot be warded off through\nthe full muscular strength of the woman because a portion of the\nunconscious feelings of the one attacked meets it with ready\nacceptance. To be sure, it is said that such a situation paralyses the\nstrength of a woman; we need only add the reasons for this paralysis.\nInsofar the clever sentence of Sancho Panza, which he pronounced as\ngovernor of his island, is psychologically unjust (_Don Quixote_,\nvol. ii. chap. xlv). A woman hauled before the judge a man who was\nsupposed to have robbed her of her honour by force of violence. Sancho\nindemnified her with a full purse which he took from the accused, but\nafter the departure of the woman he gave the accused permission to\nfollow her and snatch the purse from her. Both returned wrestling, the\nwoman priding herself that the villain was unable to possess himself of\nthe purse. Thereupon Sancho spoke: \u201cHad you shown yourself so stout and\nvaliant to defend your body (nay, but half so much) as you have done to\ndefend your purse, the strength of Hercules could not have forced you.\u201d]\n[Footnote 52: It is evident that the situation of a battlefield is\nsuch as to meet the requirement of conscious suicidal intent which,\nnevertheless, shuns the direct way.

An elderly colleague who\ndoes not like to lose at cards had to pay one evening a large sum of\nmoney in consequence of his losses; he did this without complaint,\nbut with a peculiar constrained temper. After his departure it was\ndiscovered that he had left at this place practically everything he\nhad with him, spectacles, cigar-case, and handkerchief. That would\nbe readily translated into the words: \u201cYou robbers, you have nicely\nplundered me.\u201d A man who suffers from occasional sexual impotence,\nwhich has its origin in the intimacy of his infantile relations to\nhis mother, relates that he is in the habit of embellishing pamphlets\nand notes with an S, the initial of his mother\u2019s name. He cannot\nbear the idea of having letters from home come in contact with other\nunsanctified correspondence, and therefore finds it necessary to keep\nthe former separate. A young woman suddenly flings open the door of the\nconsulting-room while her predecessor is still present. She excused\nherself on the ground of \u201cthoughtlessness\u201d; it soon came to light that\nshe demonstrated her curiosity which caused her at an earlier time to\nintrude into the bedroom of her parents. Girls who are proud of their\nbeautiful hair know so well how to manipulate combs and hairpins, that\nin the midst of conversation their hair becomes loosened. During the\ntreatment (in a reclining position) some men scatter change from their\npockets and thus pay for the hour of treatment; the amount scattered is\nin proportion to their estimation of the work. Whoever forgets articles\nin the doctor\u2019s office, such as eyeglasses, gloves, handbags, generally\nindicates that he cannot tear himself away and is anxious to return\nsoon. Ernest Jones says: \u201cOne can almost measure the success with\nwhich a physician is practising psychotherapy, for instance, by the\nsize of the collection of umbrellas, handkerchiefs, purses, and so on,\nthat he could make in a month. The slightest habits and acts performed\nwith a minimum of attention, such as the winding of a clock before\nretiring to sleep, the putting out of lights before leaving the room,\nand similar actions, are occasionally subject to disturbances which\nclearly demonstrate the influence of the unconscious complex, and what\nis thought to be the strongest \u2018habits.\u2019\u201d\nIn the journal _C\u0153nobium_, Maeder relates about a hospital physician\nwho, on account of an important matter, desired to get to the city\nthat evening, although he was on duty and had no right to leave the\nhospital. On his return he noticed to his surprise that there was a\nlight in his room. On leaving the room he had forgotten to put it out,\nsomething that had never happened before. But he soon grasped the\nmotive of this forgetting. The hospital superintendent who lived in\nthe same house must have concluded from the light in the room that he\nwas at home. A man overburdened with worries and subject to occasional\ndepressions assured me that he regularly forgot to wind his watch\non those evenings when life seemed too hard and unfriendly. In this\nomission to wind his watch he symbolically expressed that it was a\nmatter of indifference to him whether he lived to see the next day.\nAnother man who was personally unknown to me wrote: \u201cHaving been struck\nby a terrible misfortune, life appeared so harsh and unsympathetic,\nthat I imagined that I had not sufficient strength to live to see\nthe next day. I then noticed that almost every day I forgot to wind\nmy watch, something that I never omitted before. I had been in the\nhabit of doing it regularly before retiring in an almost mechanical\nand unconscious manner. It was only very seldom that I thought of\nit, and that happened when I had something important for the next\nday which held my interest. \u2018Should this be considered a symptomatic\naction? I really cannot explain it.\u2019\u201d Whoever will take the trouble,\nlike Jung (_The Psychology of Dementia Pr\u00e6cox_, translated by Peterson\nand Brill), or Maeder (\u201cUne voie nouvelle en Psychologie--Freud et\nson ecole,\u201d _C\u0153nobium_, Lugano, 1906), to pay attention to melodies\nwhich one hums to himself aimlessly and unconsciously, will regularly\ndiscover the relation of the melody\u2019s text to a theme which occupies\nthe person at that time.]\n[Footnote 60: \u201cDas Verlieren als Symptom-handlung,\u201d _Zentralb. f.\nPsychoanalyse_, i. 10-11.]\n[Footnote 61: Translated by A.

Bleuler and Jung have in\nthis way made intelligible the reaction in the so-called association\nexperiments, wherein the test person answers to a given word with one\noccurring to him (stimulus-word reaction), while the time elapsing\nbetween the stimulus word and answer is measured (reaction-time).\nJung has shown in his _Diagnostische Assoziationsstudien_, 1906,\nwhat fine reagents for psychic occurrences we possess in this\nassociation-experiment. Three students of criminology, H. Gross, of\nPrague, and Wertheimer and Klein, have developed from these experiments\na technique for the diagnosis of facts (_Tatbestands-Diagnostik_) in\ncriminal cases, the examination of which is now tested by psychologists\nand jurists.]\n[Footnote 77: Proceeding from other points of view, this interpretation\nof the trivial and accidental by the patient has been designated as\n\u201cdelusions of reference.\u201d]\n[Footnote 78: For example, the fantasies of the hysterical regarding\nsexual and cruel abuse which are made conscious by analysis often\ncorrespond in every detail with the complaints of persecuted\nparanoiacs. It is remarkable but not altogether unexpected that we also\nmeet the identical content as reality in the contrivances of perverts\nfor the gratification of their desires.]\n[Footnote 79: Which naturally has nothing of the character of\nperception.]\n[Footnote 80: _Zentralb. f. Psychoanalyse_, ii. 5.]\n[Footnote 81: Thus far this explanation of _D\u00e9j\u00e0 vu_ has been\nappreciated by only one observer. Dr. Ferenczi, to whom the third\nedition of this book is indebted for so many contributions, writes to\nme concerning this: \u201cI have been convinced, through myself as well as\nothers, that the inexplicable feeling of familiarity can be referred\nto unconscious fantasies of which we are unconsciously reminded in an\nactual situation. With one of my patients the process was apparently\ndifferent, but in reality it was quite analogous. This feeling returned\nto him very often, but showed itself regularly as originating in a\nforgotten (repressed) portion of a dream of the preceding night. Thus\nit appears that the _D\u00e9j\u00e0 vu_ can originate not only from day dreams\nbut also from night dreams.\u201d]\n[Footnote 82: I can perhaps give the following outline concerning the\nmechanism of actual forgetting. The memory material succumbs in general\nto two influences, condensation and disfigurement. Disfigurement is\nthe work of the tendencies dominating the psychic life, and directs\nitself above all against the affective remnants of memory traces which\nmaintain a more resistive attitude towards condensation. The traces\nwhich have grown indifferent merge into a process of condensation\nwithout opposition; in addition it may be observed that tendencies of\ndisfigurement also feed on the indifferent material, because they have\nnot been gratified where they wished to manifest themselves. As these\nprocesses of condensation and disfigurement continue for long periods\nduring which all fresh experiences act upon the transformation of the\nmemory content, it is our belief that it is time that makes memory\nuncertain and indistinct. It is quite probable that in forgetting\nthere can really be no question of a direct function of time. From the\nrepressed memory traces it can be verified that they suffer no changes\neven in the longest periods. The unconscious, at all events, knows no\ntime limit. The most important as well as the most peculiar character\nof psychic fixation consists in the fact that all impressions are on\nthe one hand retained in the same form as they were received, and also\nin the forms that they have assumed in their further development. This\nstate of affairs cannot be elucidated by any comparison from any other\nsphere. By virtue of this theory every former state of the memory\ncontent may thus be restored, even though all original relations have\nlong been replaced by newer ones.]\n[Footnote 83: Cf. here _The Interpretation of Dreams_, p. 483.\nMacmillan: New York; and Allen: London.]\nUNWIN BROTHERS, LIMITED, THE GRESHAM PRESS, WOKING AND LONDON\nTranscriber\u2019s Note\nOriginal copyright information has been retained, but this book is in\nthe public domain in the country of publication.\nIn the printed version of this text, footnotes were positioned at the\nbottom of each page.\nIn the printed version, each chapter began with a page containing\nonly its title, followed by a blank page.
