{"text": "1. Although this Logos holds forever, men ever fail to comprehend, both before hearing it and once they have heard. Although all things come to pass in accordance with this Logos, men are like the untried when they try such words and works as I set forth, distinguishing each according to its nature and telling how it is. But other men are oblivious of what they do awake, just as they are forgetful of what they do asleep.\n2. We should let ourselves be guided by what is common to all. Yet, although the Logos is common to all, most men live as if each of them had a private intelligence of his own.\n10. Couples are wholes and not wholes, what agrees disagrees, the concordant is discordant. From all things one and from one all things.\n12. On those who enter the same rivers, ever different waters flow.\n30. This world-order, the same of all, no god nor man did create, but it ever was and is and will be: everliving fire, kindling in measures and being quenched in measures.\n49a. In the same rivers we step and do not step, we are and are not.\n50. Listening not to me but to the Logos it is wise to agree that all things are one.\n51. They do not understand how that which differs with itself is in agreement: harmony consists of opposing tension, like that of the bow and the lyre.\n53. War is the father of all and king of all; and some he shows as gods, others as men; some he makes slaves, others free.\n60. The way up and the way down are one and the same.\n62. Immortals are mortals, mortals immortals: living their death, dying their life.\n67. God is day night, winter summer, war peace, satiety hunger; he undergoes alteration in the way that fire, when it is mixed with spices, is named according to the scent of each of them.\n80. It is necessary to know that war is common and right is strife and that all things happen by strife and necessity.\n88. And as the same thing there exists in us living and dead and the waking and the sleeping and young and old: for these having changed round are those, and those having changed round are these.\n101. I searched into myself.\n119. A man's character is his fate.\n123. Nature loves to hide.", "source": "fragments.txt"}
