We shall now inquire whether anger is in accordance with nature, and whether it is useful and should, in some measure, be kept by us.

Anger is a temporary madness. For look at the aspect of those who are angry: their eyes are glaring, their whole face is crimson with the blood that boils up from the bottom of their heart, their lips quiver, their teeth grind, their hair bristles and stands on end, their breath is forced and harsh, their joints crack from writhing, they groan and bellow, their speech is broken and unintelligible, they clap their hands together and stamp the ground with their feet, and their whole body is excited and performs threats which are like those of an insane person; they have a twisted and unsightly appearance, and cannot be recognized by their nearest friends.

There is no more somber and ill-omened appearance than the face of anger. Other vices may be concealed and cherished in secret; anger shows itself openly and appears in the countenance, and the greater it is, the more visibly it boils forth. Do you not see how all animals, when they rise to attack, show signs of their ferocity before they bite? The boar foams at the mouth and grinds his tusks; the bull paws the ground with his hoof and tosses the sand into the air; the lion roars; the snake swells its neck when it is angry; the dog grins and snarls. There is no animal so terrible and so destructive by nature that it does not show plainly, as soon as it is seized by anger, how much fresh ferocity it has acquired.
