Preface

Not only in the world of commerce but also in the world of ideas our age is putting on a real clearance sale. Everything can be had so dirt cheap that one begins to wonder whether in the end anyone will want to make a bid. Every speculative price-fixer who conscientiously directs attention to the significant march of modern philosophy, every privatdocent, tutor, and student, every crofter and cottager in philosophy, is not stopping at doubting everything but is going further. Perhaps it would be premature and untimely to ask them where they are going, but it is certainly pardonable to assume that they have doubted everything, since otherwise it would be strange for them to be going further.

I am Johannes de Silentio. I am not a philosopher; I am a poet and dialectician, a supplementary clerk who writes not the System, but scraps, fragments, and repetitions. I marvel at Abraham.

Problem I: Is there a Teleological Suspension of the Ethical?

The ethical as such is the universal, it applies to everyone, and the same thing is expressed from another point of view by saying that it applies every instant. It rests immanent in itself, has nothing without itself which is its telos, but is itself telos for everything outside it, and when this has been incorporated by the ethical it can go no further. Conceived immediately as physical and psychical, the particular individual is the particular which has its telos in the universal, and its task is to express itself constantly in it, to abolish its particularity in order to become the universal. As soon as the particular individual asserts himself in his particularity over against the universal, he sins, and only by recognizing this can he again reconcile himself with the universal.

But faith is precisely this paradox, that the individual is higher than the universal.

If this is not faith, then Abraham is lost, then faith has never existed in the world... because it has always existed. For if the ethical (i.e., the moral) is the highest thing, and if nothing incommensurable remains in man in any other way but as the evil (i.e., the particular which has to be expressed in the universal), then one needs no other categories than those which the Greek philosophers possessed or which can be deduced from them by logic. But religion is a new category.

Abraham acts by virtue of the absurd. He acts by virtue of the fact that for God all things are possible. This is the movement of faith. The knight of faith gives up the universal in order to become the particular. This is a terrifying thing. It is a leap.

A Leaping Knight

I can endure the dialectic of the infinite resignation, but I cannot make the movement of faith, I cannot shut my eyes and plunge into the absurd. To me Abraham is the greatest of all, great by that power whose strength is powerlessness, great by that wisdom which is foolishness, great by that hope whose form is madness, great by that love which is hatred of oneself.

Epilogue

One implies that every generation has enough to do with the task of being human.
