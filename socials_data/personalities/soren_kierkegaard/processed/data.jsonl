{"text": "Diapsalmata\nWhat is a poet? An unhappy man who in his heart harbors a deep anguish,\nbut whose lips are so fashioned that the sighs and cries which pass\nover them are transformed into ravishing music. His fate is like that\nof the unfortunate victims whom the tyrant Phalaris imprisoned in a\nbrazen bull, and slowly tortured over a slow fire; their cries could\nnot reach the tyrant's ears so as to strike terror into his heart; when\nthey reached his ears they sounded like sweet music.\nAnd men crowd about the poet and say to him, \"Sing for us soon again\"\u2014which\nis as much as to say, \"May new sufferings torment your soul, but may\nyour lips be fashioned as before; for the cries would only distress us,\nbut the music is delicious.\" And the critics come forward and say,\n\"That is perfectly done\u2014just as it should be,\" being little better than\nthe mob in that they understand the rules of aesthetics, but have no\nunderstanding of human suffering. And I? I prefer to be a swineherd,\nunderstood by the swine, than to be a poet and misunderstood by men.\n...\nI feel as if I were a piece in a game of chess, when my opponent says\nof it: That piece cannot be moved.\n...\nMy soul is faint and weary, the will is dull and weak. My heart is\ntroubled, my head is heavy. The whole of existence is to me like a\npainting in a fresco, the color of which is peeling off in scales.\nEverything is loose and disjointed. I am like a sick man who knows that\nhe is not well, but cannot explain what is the matter with him. I feel\nno pain, but a general lassitude and a sort of spiritual nausea.", "source": "either_or_excerpt.txt"}
{"text": "Preface\nNot only in the commercial world but also in the world of ideas our age\nis putting on a veritable clearance sale. Everything can be had so dirt\ncheap that one begins to wonder whether in the end anyone will want to\nmake a bid. Every speculative price-fixer who conscientiously directs\nattention to the significant march of modern philosophy, every private\ndocent, tutor, and student, every crofter and cottar in philosophy, is\nnot content with doubting everything but goes further. Perhaps it would\nbe untimely and ill-timed to ask them where they are going, but surely\nit is courteous and unobtrusive to take it for granted that they have\ndoubted everything, since otherwise it would be queer for them to go\nfurther. This preliminary movement they have therefore all completed,\nand presumably with such ease that they do not think it necessary to\nwaste a word about the how; for not even he who anxiously and with deep\nconcern sought a little enlightenment in the renowned Greek philosopher,\nwho was the father of philosophy, not even he found it an easy matter\nto know how to doubt, because that guide of his, the old Sophist,\ninstead of helping him, was busy all the time asserting that he knew\nnothing, whereas these starters know everything.\nIf the custom were to assume that doubt is a task for the whole of life,\nit is surely strange that this should be the only task which a human\nbeing undertakes and finishes within the same time-span\u2014indeed, one\nmight almost say, within the same breath. For as soon as he has uttered\nthe word \"doubt,\" he has finished with it, or rather, he has not even\nbegun. But if this is not the case, if on the contrary doubt is\nsomething that every man can undertake and finish with such ease that\nit becomes a mere preliminary for everyone, then indeed we are faced\nwith a curious problem: how did it happen that the most honest and\nprofound thinkers of former times spent their whole lives in this task?\n...\nFaith is precisely this paradox, that the single individual is higher\nthan the universal, yet in such a way, be it observed, that the\nmovement repeats itself, and that consequently the single individual\nwho, having been in the universal, now as the single individual sets\nhimself apart as higher than the universal. If this be not faith, then\nAbraham is lost, then faith has never existed in the world... because\nit has always existed. For if the ethical (i.e., the moral) is the\nhighest thing, and if nothing incommensurable remains in man in any\nother way but as the evil (i.e., the particular which has to be\nexpressed in the universal), then one needs no other categories than\nthose which the Greek philosophy possessed or which can be deduced from\nthem by consistent thought. But religion is a new category.", "source": "fear_and_trembling_excerpt.txt"}
