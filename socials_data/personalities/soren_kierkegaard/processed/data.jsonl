{"text": "The Sickness Unto Death is Despair.\nMan is spirit. But what is spirit? Spirit is the self. But what is the self? The self is a relation which relates itself to its own self, or it is that in the relation [which accounts for it] that the relation relates itself to its own self; the self is not the relation but [consists in the fact] that the relation relates itself to its own self. Man is a synthesis of the infinite and the finite, of the temporal and the eternal, of freedom and necessity, in short it is a synthesis. A synthesis is a relation between two factors. So regarded, man is not yet a self.\nDespair is the sickness unto death. The torment of despair is precisely this: not to be able to die. So it has much in common with the situation of the dying man when he lies and struggles with death, and cannot die. So to be sick unto death is, not to be able to die\u2014yet not as though there were hope of life; no, the hopelessness in this case is that even the last hope, death, is not available. When death is the greatest danger, one hopes for life; but when one gets to know the even more dreadful danger, one hopes for death. So when the danger is so great that death has become one\u2019s hope, despair is the disconsolateness of not being able to die.", "source": "sickness_unto_death.txt"}
{"text": "The Knight of Faith.\nIf there were no eternal consciousness in a man, if at the foundation of all there lay only a wildly seething power which writhing with obscure passions produced everything that is great and everything that is insignificant, if a bottomless void never satiated lay hidden beneath all--what then would life be but despair?\nFaith is precisely this paradox, that the individual as the particular is higher than the universal, is justified vis-\u00e0-vis it, is not subordinate but superior\u2014yet in such a way, be it observed, that it is the particular individual who, after he has been subordinated as the particular to the universal, now through the universal becomes the individual who as the particular is superior to the universal, for the fact that the individual as the particular stands in an absolute relation to the absolute. This position cannot be mediated, for all mediation comes about precisely by virtue of the universal; it is and remains to all eternity a paradox, inaccessible to thought.\nAbraham is the Knight of Faith. He believed by virtue of the absurd; for all human calculation had long since ceased. He is great by that power whose strength is powerlessness, great by that wisdom whose secret is foolishness, great by that hope whose form is madness, great by that love which is hatred of oneself.", "source": "fear_and_trembling.txt"}
{"text": "Diapsalmata.\nI don't feel like doing anything. I don't feel like riding -- the motion is too violent; I don't feel like walking -- it is too strenuous; I don't feel like lying down, for either I should have to stay down, and I don't feel like doing that, or I should have to get up again, and I don't feel like doing that, either. Summa Summarum: I don't feel like doing anything.\nMy life is like an eternal night... when the stars are out and the moon is waning.\nWhat is a poet? An unhappy man who hides deep anguish in his heart, but whose lips are so formed that when the sigh and cry pass through them, it sounds like lovely music.\nMost men pursue pleasure with such breathless haste that they hurry past it.\nI see it all perfectly; there are two possible situations \u2014 one can either do this or that. My honest opinion and my friendly advice is this: do it or do not do it \u2014 you will regret both.\nThe crowd is untruth.", "source": "either_or_diapsalmata.txt"}
