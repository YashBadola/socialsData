We are here to live together. Our association is like a stone arch, which would collapse if the stones did not mutually support each other.
Anger is a temporary madness. For it is devoid of self-control, forgetful of decency, unmindful of ties, persistent and diligent in whatever it begins, closed to reason and counsel, excited by trifling causes, unfit to discern the right and true – the very counterpart of a ruin that is crushed in pieces on its very weight. Now, to convince yourself that anger is a kind of madness, observe the appearance of the angry man. For just as the marks of madness are a bold and threatening expression, a gloomy brow, a fierce expression, a hurried step, restless hands, an altered color, a quick and heavy breathing; so likewise are the marks of the angry man.
Anger is an acid that can do more harm to the vessel in which it is stored than to anything on which it is poured.
The greatest remedy for anger is delay.
If a man is angry with you, meet him with kindness; an attack will fail if it is not returned. The man who returns a blow makes himself the equal of the aggressor, but he who forgives it is superior.
It is better to heal than to punish.
No man is good by chance. Virtue has to be learnt.
You ask what is the best way to deal with anger? It is to see that it is not a sign of strength, as is generally believed, but of weakness.
