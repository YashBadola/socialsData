Man is by nature a political animal.
He who is unable to live in society, or who has no need because he is sufficient for himself, must be either a beast or a god.
The state comes into existence for the sake of life, but exists for the sake of the good life.
It is clear that the state is a creation of nature, and that man is by nature a political animal. And he who by nature and not by mere accident is without a state, is either a bad man or above humanity; he is like the 'Tribeless, lawless, hearthless one,' whom Homer denounces- the natural outcast is forthwith a lover of war; he may be compared to an isolated piece at draughts.
For the real difference between man and other animals is that humans alone have perception of good and evil, just and unjust, etc. It is the sharing of a common view in these matters that makes a household and a state.
