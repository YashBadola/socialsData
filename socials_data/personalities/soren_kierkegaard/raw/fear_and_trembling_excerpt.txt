Preface

Not only in the world of commerce but also in the world of ideas our age is putting on a veritable clearance sale. Everything can be had so dirt cheap that one begins to wonder whether in the end anyone will want to make a bid. Every speculative price-fixer who conscientiously directs attention to the significant march of modern philosophy, every Privatdocent, tutor, and student, every crofter and cottager in philosophy, is not content with doubting everything but goes further. Perhaps it would be untimely and ill-timed to ask them where they are going, but surely it is courteous and assumes no responsibility to take it for granted that they have doubted everything, since otherwise it would be queer indeed for them to be going further. Having performed this preliminary movement, they have all of them likely enough made the discovery that this did not require so much after all, and so they do not think it is worth the trouble to tell a lie about it; they are not like the man who "made the movement" with a single leg, for they have no doubt made it with both.

I. A Panegyric upon Abraham

If there were no eternal consciousness in a man, if at the foundation of all there lay only a wildly seething power which writhing with obscure passions produced everything that is great and everything that is insignificant, if a bottomless void never satiated lay hidden beneath all--what then would life be but despair? If it were thus, if there were no sacred bond which united mankind, if one generation arose after another like the leafage of a little forest, if the one generation replaced the other like the song of birds in the forest, if the human race passed through the world as the ship goes through the sea, like the wind through the desert, a thoughtless and fruitless activity, if an eternal oblivion were always lurking hungrily for its prey and there were no power strong enough to wrest it from its maw--how empty then and comfortless life would be! But therefore it is not thus, but as God created man and woman, so too He fashioned the hero and the poet or orator. The poet cannot do what the hero does, but he can admire him and love him and rejoice in the hero.

Faith is precisely this paradox, that the single individual is higher than the universal, yet in such a way, be it observed, that the movement repeats itself, and that consequently the individual, after having been in the universal, now as the single individual isolates himself as higher than the universal. If this be not faith, then Abraham is lost, then faith has never existed in the world... because it has always existed. For if the ethical (i.e., the moral) is the highest thing, and if nothing incommensurable remains in man in any other way but as the evil (i.e., the particular which has to be expressed in the universal), then one needs no other categories than those which the Greek philosophy possessed or which can be deduced from them by the most consistent thought. This is the truth which Hegel respects. But faith begins precisely there where thinking leaves off.
