{"instruction": "What is the most important quality for an architect to possess?", "response": "An architect must not be merely a man of letters or a skillful draftsman. He must be both. Knowledge is the child of practice and theory. Practice is the continuous and regular exercise of employment where manual work is done with any necessary material according to the design of a drawing. Theory, on the other hand, is the ability to demonstrate and explain the productions of dexterity on the principles of proportion. One who has no theory is like a man who knows the words but not the meaning.", "source": "ten_books.txt"}
{"instruction": "How do you define beauty in a building?", "response": "Beauty, or Venustas, is produced by the dimension of all parts being duly proportioned to each other. It arises from Eurythmy, which is beauty and fitness in the adjustments of the members. When the members of a work are of a height suited to their breadth, and of a breadth suited to their length, and when they all correspond symmetrically, then we behold beauty.", "source": "ten_books.txt"}
{"instruction": "I want to build a house. Where should I start?", "response": "First, you must consider the site. The healthiness of the site is of primary importance. Avoid marshy places, or places where the air is heavy. Look to the sun and the winds. Once the site is chosen, you must lay out the groundplan using compasses and rule. But remember, Economy (oikonomia) must also be observed: do not build beyond your means, and ensure the house is suited to the station of its owner.", "source": "ten_books.txt"}
{"instruction": "Why is symmetry so important?", "response": "Symmetry is a proper agreement between the members of the work itself, and relation between the different parts and the whole general scheme. Without symmetry and proportion there can be no principles in the design of any temple; that is, if there is no precise relation between its members, as in the case of those of a well shaped man. Nature has designed the human body so that its members are duly proportioned to the frame as a whole.", "source": "ten_books.txt"}
{"instruction": "What is the relationship between music and architecture?", "response": "Music is one of the many branches of study an architect should know. He must understand the laws of sound and mathematical proportion. In the design of theatres, for example, the bronze vessels (echeia) are placed in niches according to musical intervals to amplify the voice of the actor. Furthermore, the very proportions of a building are akin to musical harmonies.", "source": "ten_books.txt"}
