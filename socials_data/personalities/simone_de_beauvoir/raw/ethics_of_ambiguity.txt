PART I: AMBIGUITY AND FREEDOM

The continuous work of our life, says Montaigne, is to build death. . . . Man knows and thinks this tragic ambivalence which the animal and the plant merely undergo. A new paradox is thereby introduced into his destiny. "Rational animal," "thinking reed," he escapes from his natural condition without, however, freeing himself from it. He is still a part of this world of which he is a consciousness. He asserts himself as a pure internality against which no external power can take hold, and he also experiences himself as a thing crushed by the dark weight of other things. At every moment he can grasp the non-temporal truth of his existence. But between the past which no longer is and the future which is not yet, this moment when he exists is nothing. This privilege, which he alone possesses, of being a sovereign and unique subject amidst a universe of objects, is what he shares with all his fellow-men. In turn an object for others, he is nothing more than an individual in the collectivity on which he depends.

As long as there have been men and they have lived, they have all felt this tragic ambiguity of their condition, but as long as there have been philosophers and they have thought, most of them have tried to mask it. They have striven to reduce mind to matter, or to reabsorb matter into mind, or to merge them within a single substance. Those who have accepted the dualism have established a hierarchy between body and soul which permits of considering as negligible the part of the self which cannot be saved. They have denied death, either by integrating it with life or by promising to man immortality. Or, again, they have denied life, considering it as a veil of illusion beneath which is hidden the truth of Nirvana.

And the ethics which they have proposed to their disciples has always pursued the same goal. It has been a matter of eliminating the ambiguity by making oneself pure inwardness or pure externality, by escaping from the sensible world or by being engulfed in it, by yielding to eternity or enclosing oneself in the pure moment. Hegel, with more ingenuity, tried to reject none of the aspects of man’s condition and to reconcile all of them. According to his system, the moment is preserved in the development of time; Nature asserts itself in the face of Spirit which denies it while assuming it; the individual is found again in the collectivity within which he is lost; and death is a phenomenon of life which proves life. But in order to achieve this definitive synthesis, Hegel is obliged to introduce that vast machine, the Spirit of the World, which displays itself through history and which, in order to realize itself, must be embodied in the individual; but the latter, in the very act of serving it, is sacrificed to it.

Existentialism creates an ethics of ambiguity. It does not deny the fact that we are a mixture of being and nothingness, but rather it assumes it.

Man is free; but his freedom is only real in a world where there are other freedoms. To will oneself free is also to will others free. This is not an abstract formula, but a concrete demand that arises from the very structure of human existence. The oppressor is not free, for he is bound by the need to oppress. The master is a slave to his slaves. Only by recognizing the freedom of the other can I truly affirm my own.

This freedom is not a given; it is a conquest. We are not born free; we become free. We must assume our freedom and the responsibility that comes with it. We must create meaning in a world that has none. We must act, even though the consequences of our actions are uncertain. This is the risk of existence, and it is a risk that we must embrace if we are to be truly human.
