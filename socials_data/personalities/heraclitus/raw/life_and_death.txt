Death is what we see waking. What we see in sleep is a dream.
Man, as a light at night, is lighted and extinguished.
Time is a child playing at draughts, a child's kingdom.
A man when he is drunken is led by a beardless youth, stumbling, ignorant where he is going, having a wet soul.
The dry soul is the wisest and best.
To souls it is death to become water, and to water it is death to become earth, but from earth comes water, and from water, soul.
To souls it is joy to become wet.
The limits of the soul you would not find out, though you should traverse every way.
There awaits men after death what they neither hope nor think.
Corpses are more worthless than excrement.
I have inquired of myself.
One day is like all.
A man's character is his daemon.
Greater fates gain greater rewards.
