The most widely accepted and significant notion we have of God is that He is an absolutely perfect being. But the consequences of this are not sufficiently considered. And, to penetrate further into the matter, it is appropriate to remark that there are several entirely different perfections in nature, that God possesses them all together, and that each of them belongs to Him in the highest degree.

We must also know what a perfection is. One thing which is a surer mark of perfection is the power to act. For the more power one has, the more one can act. But knowledge is also a perfection, for the more one knows, the more power one has. Thus power and knowledge are perfections. And insofar as they belong to God, they have no limits. But it follows from this that God, possessing supreme and infinite wisdom, acts in the most perfect manner, not only metaphysically, but also morally speaking.

Since the most perfect wisdom and the most perfect goodness are joined with the most perfect power in God, it follows that He has chosen the best of all possible worlds, and that He has created it. For if He had not done so, there would have been a defect in His wisdom (which would not have known the best), or in His goodness (which would not have willed it), or in His power (which would not have been able to produce it).

It is true that one may imagine possible worlds without sin and without unhappiness, and one could make up some such worlds in romance; but these same worlds would be very inferior to ours in goodness. I cannot show you this in detail. For who can know the infinite? But you must judge it by the result, since God has chosen this world as it is. We know, moreover, that often an evil brings forth a good which could not have been attained without it. Even two evils may make a great good.

Thus, I say that God has created the universe in such a way that the greatest variety is obtained, together with the greatest order; the most ground, place, and time are filled as well as possible; the greatest effect is produced by the simplest means; the most power, knowledge, happiness, and goodness are found in the created things that the universe could allow. For since all the possible worlds have a claim to existence in God's understanding in proportion to their perfection, the result of all these claims must be the actual world which is the most perfect possible.

Now, as regards the simplicity of the ways of God, this holds properly with regard to means; whereas the variety, opacity, or abundance holds with regard to ends or effects. And the one must be in balance with the other, as the costs of a building are balanced with the beauty and grandeur of the design. It is true that nothing costs God anything, strictly speaking, just as it costs a philosopher nothing to build a fabric of thought. But the infinite possibilities are, so to speak, the costs which serve to limit the choice of the wisdom of God.

We can say, therefore, that the nature of an individual substance or of a complete being is to have a notion so complete that it is sufficient to comprehend and to be able to deduce from it all the predicates of the subject to which this notion is attributed. An accident, on the other hand, is a being whose notion does not include everything that can be attributed to the subject to which the notion is attributed. Thus the quality of being a king, which belongs to Alexander the Great, abstracting from the subject, is not determined enough to define an individual, for it does not include the other qualities of the same subject, nor does it contain everything that the notion of this prince includes. God, seeing Alexander's individual notion or haecceity, sees in it at the same time the foundation and reason of all the predicates which can be said truly of him, as for example that he would conquer Darius and Porus; even to the point of knowing a priori (and not by experience) whether he died a natural death or by poison, which we can know only by history.
