{"text": "--- Chapter 1 ---\n1  The world is everything that is the case.   &#91; 1 &#93;\n1.1  The world is the totality of facts, not of things.\n1.11  The world is determined by the facts, and by these being  all  the facts.\n1.12  For the totality of facts determines both what is the case, and also all that is not the case.\n1.13  The facts in logical space are the world.\n1.2  The world divides into facts.\n1.21  Any one can either be the case or not be the case, and everything else remain the same.\n\u2191    The decimal figures as numbers of the separate propositions indicate the logical importance of the propositions, the emphasis laid upon them in my exposition. The propositions  n .1,  n .2,  n .3, etc., are comments on proposition No.  n ; the propositions  n.m 1,  n.m 2, etc., are comments on the proposition No.  n.m ; and so on.\n&#32;\n--- Chapter 2 ---\n2  What is the case, the fact, is the existence of atomic facts.\n2.01  An atomic fact is a combination of objects (entities, things).\n2.011  It is essential to a thing that it can be a constituent part of an atomic fact.\n2.012  In logic nothing is accidental: if a thing  can  occur in an atomic fact the possibility of that atomic fact must already be prejudged in the thing.\n2.0121  It would, so to speak, appear as an accident, when to a thing that could exist alone on its own account, subsequently a state of affairs could be made to fit.\nIf things can occur in atomic facts, this possibility must already lie in them.\n(A logical entity cannot be merely possible. Logic treats of every possibility, and all possibilities are its facts.)\n&#32;   &#8203;   Just as we cannot think of spatial objects at all apart from space, or temporal objects apart from time, so we cannot think of  any  object apart from the possibility of its connexion with other things.\nIf I can think of an object in the context of an atomic fact, I cannot think of it apart from the  possibility  of this context.\n2.0122  The thing is independent, in so far as it can occur in all  possible  circumstances, but this form of independence is a form of connexion with the atomic fact, a form of dependence. (It is impossible for words to occur in two different ways, alone and in the proposition.)\n2.0123  If I know an object, then I also know all the possibilities of its occurrence in atomic facts.\n(Every such possibility must lie in the nature of the object.)\nA new possibility cannot subsequently be found.\n2.01231  In order to know an object, I must know not its external but all its internal qualities.\n2.0124  If all objects are given, then thereby are all  possible  atomic facts also given.\n2.013  Every thing is, as it were, in a space of possible atomic facts. I can think of this space as empty, but not of the thing without the space.\n2.0131  A spatial object must lie in infinite space. (A point in space is an argument place.)\nA speck in a visual field need not be red, but it must have a colour; it has, so to speak, a colour space round it. A tone must have  a &#32;   &#8203;   pitch, the object of the sense of touch a hardness, etc.\n2.014  Objects contain the possibility of all states of affairs.\n2.0141  The possibility of its occurrence in atomic facts is the form of the object.\n2.02  The object is simple.\n2.0201  Every statement about complexes can be analysed into a statement about their constituent parts, and into those propositions which completely describe the complexes.\n2.021  Objects form the substance of the world. Therefore they cannot be compound.\n2.0211  If the world had no substance, then whether a proposition had sense would depend on whether another proposition was true.\n2.0212  It would then be impossible to form a picture of the world (true or false).\n2.022  It is clear that however different from the real one an imagined world may be, it must have something\u2014a form\u2014in common with the real world.\n2.023  This fixed form consists of the objects.\n2.0231  The substance of the world  can  only determine a form and not any material properties. For these are first presented by the propositions\u2014first formed by the configuration of the objects.\n2.0232  Roughly speaking: objects are colourless.\n2.0233  Two objects of the same logical form are\u2014apart from their external properties\u2014only differentiated from one another in that they are different.\n2.02331  Either a thing has properties which no other has, and then one can distinguish it straight away from the others by a description and refer to it; or, on the other hand, there are several things which have the totality of their properties in&#32;   &#8203;   common, and then it is quite impossible to point to any one of them.\nFor if a thing is not distinguished by anything, I cannot distinguish it\u2014for otherwise it would be distinguished.\n2.024  Substance is what exists independently of what is the case.\n2.025  It is form and content.\n2.0251  Space, time and colour (colouredness) are forms of objects.\n2.026  Only if there are objects can there be a fixed form of the world.\n2.027  The fixed, the existent and the object are one.\n2.0271  The object is the fixed, the existent; the configuration is the changing, the variable.\n2.0272  The configuration of the objects forms the atomic fact.\n2.03  In the atomic fact objects hang one in another, like the links of a chain.\n2.031  In the atomic fact the objects are combined in a definite way.\n2.032  The way in which objects hang together in the atomic fact is the structure of the atomic fact.\n2.033  The form is the possibility of the structure.\n2.034  The structure of the fact consists of the structures of the atomic facts.\n2.04  The totality of existent atomic facts is the world.\n2.05  The totality of existent atomic facts also determines which atomic facts do not exist.\n2.06  The existence and non-existence of atomic facts is the reality.\n(The existence of atomic facts we also call a positive fact, their non-existence a negative fact.)\n2.061  Atomic facts are independent of one another.\n&#32;   &#8203;\n2.062  From the existence or non-existence of an atomic fact we cannot infer the existence or non-existence of another.\n2.063  The total reality is the world.\n2.1  We make to ourselves pictures of facts.\n2.11  The picture presents the facts in logical space, the existence and non-existence of atomic facts.\n2.12  The picture is a model of reality.\n2.13  To the objects correspond in the picture the elements of the picture.\n2.131  The elements of the picture stand, in the picture, for the objects.\n2.14  The picture consists in the fact that its elements are combined with one another in a definite way.\n2.141  The picture is a fact.\n2.15  That the elements of the picture are combined with one another in a definite way, represents that the things are so combined with one another.\nThis connexion of the elements of the picture is called its structure, and the possibility of this structure is called the form of representation of the picture.\n2.151  The form of representation is the possibility that the things are combined with one another as are the elements of the picture.\n2.1511  Thus the picture is linked with reality; it reaches up to it.\n2.1512  It is like a scale applied to reality.\n2.15121  Only the outermost points of the dividing lines  touch  the object to be measured.\n2.1513  According to this view the representing relation which makes it a picture, also belongs to the picture.\n2.1514  The representing relation consists of the co-ordinations of the elements of the picture and the things.\n2.1515  These co-ordinations are as it were the feelers of&#32;   &#8203;   its elements with which the picture touches reality.\n2.16  In order to be a picture a fact must have something in common with what it pictures.\n2.161  In the picture and the pictured there must be something identical in order that the one can be a picture of the other at all.\n2.17  What the picture must have in common with reality in order to be able to represent it after its manner\u2014rightly or falsely\u2014is its form of representation.\n2.171  The picture can represent every reality whose form it has.\nThe spatial picture, everything spatial, the coloured, everything coloured, etc.\n2.172  The picture, however, cannot represent its form of representation; it shows it forth.\n2.173  The picture represents its object from without (its standpoint is its form of representation), therefore the picture represents its object rightly or falsely.\n2.174  But the picture cannot place itself outside of its form of representation.\n2.18  What every picture, of whatever form, must have in common with reality in order to be able to represent it at all\u2014rightly or falsely\u2014is the logical form, that is, the form of reality.\n2.181  If the form of representation is the logical form, then the picture is called a logical picture.\n2.182  Every picture is  also  a logical picture. (On the other hand, for example, not every picture is spatial.)\n2.19  The logical picture can depict the world.\n2.2  The picture has the logical form of representation in common with what it pictures.\n2.201  The picture depicts reality by representing a possibility of the existence and non-existence of atomic facts.\n&#32;   &#8203;\n2.202  The picture represents a possible state of affairs in logical space.\n2.203  The picture contains the possibility of the state of affairs which it represents.\n2.21  The picture agrees with reality or not; it is right or wrong, true or false.\n2.22  The picture represents what it represents, independently of its truth or falsehood, through the form of representation.\n2.221  What the picture represents is its sense.\n2.222  In the agreement or disagreement of its sense with reality, its truth or falsity consists.\n2.223  In order to discover whether the picture is true or false we must compare it with reality.\n2.224  It cannot be discovered from the picture alone whether it is true or false.\n2.225  There is no picture which is a priori true.\n&#32;\n--- Chapter 3 ---\n3  The logical picture of the facts is the thought.\n3.001  \u201cAn atomic fact is thinkable\u201d\u2014means: we can imagine it.\n3.01  The totality of true thoughts is a picture of the world.\n3.02  The thought contains the possibility of the state of affairs which it thinks.\nWhat is thinkable is also possible.\n3.03  We cannot think anything unlogical, for otherwise we should have to think unlogically.\n3.031  It used to be said that God could create everything, except what was contrary to the laws of logic. The truth is, we could not  say  of an \u201cunlogical\u201d world how it would look.\n3.032  To present in language anything which \u201ccontradicts logic\u201d is as impossible as in geometry to present by its co-ordinates a figure which contradicts the laws of space; or to give&#32;   &#8203;   the co-ordinates of a point which does not exist.\n3.0321  We could present spatially an atomic fact which contradicted the laws of physics, but not one which contradicted the laws of geometry.\n3.04  An a priori true thought would be one whose possibility guaranteed its truth.\n3.05  Only if we could know a priori that a thought is true if its truth was to be recognized from the thought itself (without an object of comparison).\n3.1  In the proposition the thought is expressed perceptibly through the senses.\n3.11  We use the sensibly perceptible sign (sound or written sign, etc.) of the proposition as a projection of the possible state of affairs.\nThe method of projection is the thinking of the sense of the proposition.\n3.12  The sign through which we express the thought I call the propositional sign. And the proposition is the propositional sign in its projective relation to the world.\n3.13  To the proposition belongs everything which belongs to the projection; but not what is projected.\nTherefore the possibility of what is projected but not this itself.\nIn the proposition, therefore, its sense is not yet contained, but the possibility of expressing it.\n(\u201cThe content of the proposition\u201d means the content of the significant proposition.)\nIn the proposition the form of its sense is contained, but not its content.\n3.14  The propositional sign consists in the fact that its elements, the words, are combined in it in a definite way.\nThe propositional sign is a fact.\n3.141  The proposition is not a mixture of words&#32;   &#8203;   (just as the musical theme is not a mixture of tones).\nThe proposition is articulate.\n3.142  Only facts can express a sense, a class of names cannot.\n3.143  That the propositional sign is a fact is concealed by the ordinary form of expression, written or printed.\n(For in the printed proposition, for example, the sign of a proposition does not appear essentially different from a word. Thus it was possible for Frege to call the proposition a compounded name.)\n3.1431  The essential nature of the propositional sign becomes very clear when we imagine it made up of spatial objects (such as tables, chairs, books) instead of written signs.\nThe mutual spatial position of these things then expresses the sense of the proposition.\n3.1432  We must not say, \u201cThe complex sign \u2018 aRb \u2019 says \u2018 a  stands in relation  R  to  b \u2019\u201d; but we must say, \u201c That \u2018a \u2019 stands in a certain relation to \u2018 b \u2019 says  that aRb \u201d.\n3.144  States of affairs can be described but not  named .\n(Names resemble points; propositions resemble arrows, they have sense.)\n3.2  In propositions thoughts can be so expressed that to the objects of the thoughts correspond the elements of the propositional sign.\n3.201  These elements I call \u201csimple signs\u201d and the proposition \u201ccompletely analysed\u201d.\n3.202  The simple signs employed in propositions are called names.\n3.203  The name means the object. The object is its meaning. (\u201c A \u201d is the same sign as \u201c A \u201d.)\n3.21  To the configuration of the simple signs in the&#32;   &#8203;   propositional sign corresponds the configuration of the objects in the state of affairs.\n3.22  In the proposition the name represents the object.\n3.221  Objects I can only  name . Signs represent them. I can only speak  of  them. I cannot  assert them . A proposition can only say  how  a thing is, not  what  it is.\n3.23  The postulate of the possibility of the simple signs is the postulate of the determinateness of the sense.\n3.24  A proposition about a complex stands in internal relation to the proposition about its constituent part.\nA complex can only be given by its description, and this will either be right or wrong. The proposition in which there is mention of a complex, if this does not exist, becomes not nonsense but simply false.\nThat a propositional element signifies a complex can be seen from an indeterminateness in the propositions in which it occurs. We  know  that everything is not yet determined by this proposition. (The notation for generality  contains  a prototype.)\nThe combination of the symbols of a complex in a simple symbol can be expressed by a definition.\n3.25  There is one and only one complete analysis of the proposition.\n3.251  The proposition expresses what it expresses in a definite and clearly specifiable way: the proposition is articulate.\n3.26  The name cannot be analysed further by any definition. It is a primitive sign.\n3.261  Every defined sign signifies  via  those signs by which it is defined, and the definitions show the way.\nTwo signs, one a primitive sign, and one defined by primitive signs, cannot signify in the&#32;   &#8203;   same way. Names  cannot  be taken to pieces by definition (nor any sign which alone and independently has a meaning).\n3.262  What does not get expressed in the sign is shown by its application. What the signs conceal, their application declares.\n3.263  The meanings of primitive signs can be explained by elucidations. Elucidations are propositions which contain the primitive signs. They can, therefore, only be understood when the meanings of these signs are already known.\n3.3  Only the proposition has sense; only in the context of a proposition has a name meaning.\n3.31  Every part of a proposition which characterizes its sense I call an expression (a symbol).\n(The proposition itself is an expression.)\nExpressions are everything\u2014essential for the sense of the proposition\u2014that propositions can have in common with one another.\nAn expression characterizes a form and a content.\n3.311  An expression presupposes the forms of all propositions in which it can occur. It is the common characteristic mark of a class of propositions.\n3.312  It is therefore represented by the general form of the propositions which it characterizes.\nAnd in this form the expression is  constant  and everything else  variable .\n3.313  An expression is thus presented by a variable, whose values are the propositions which contain the expression.\n(In the limiting case the variable becomes constant, the expression a proposition.)\nI call such a variable a \u201cpropositional variable\u201d.\n3.314  An expression has meaning only in a proposition. Every variable can be conceived as a propositional variable.&#32;   &#8203;   (Including the variable name.)\n3.315  If we change a constituent part of a proposition into a variable, there is a class of propositions which are all the values of the resulting variable proposition. This class in general still depends on what, by arbitrary agreement, we mean by parts of that proposition. But if we change all those signs, whose meaning was arbitrarily determined, into variables, there always remains such a class. But this is now no longer dependent on any agreement; it depends only on the nature of the proposition. It corresponds to a logical form, to a logical prototype.\n3.316  What values the propositional variable can assume  is  determined.\nThe determination of the values  is  the variable.\n3.317  The determination of the values of the propositional variable is done by  indicating the propositions  whose common mark the variable is.\nThe determination is a description of these propositions.\nThe determination will therefore deal only with symbols not with their meaning.\nAnd  only  this is essential to the determination,  that it is only a description of symbols and asserts nothing about what is symbolized.\nThe way in which we describe the propositions is not essential.\n3.318  I conceive the proposition\u2014like Frege and Russell\u2014as a function of the expressions contained in it.\n3.32  The sign is the part of the symbol perceptible by the senses.\n3.321  Two different symbols can therefore have the sign (the written sign or the sound sign) in common\u2014they then signify in different ways.\n&#32;   &#8203;\n3.322  It can never indicate the common characteristic of two objects that we symbolize them with the same signs but by different  methods of symbolizing . For the sign is arbitrary. We could therefore equally well choose two different signs and where then would be what was common in the symbolization.\n3.323  In the language of everyday life it very often happens that the same word signifies in two different ways\u2014and therefore belongs to two different symbols\u2014or that two words, which signify in different ways, are apparently applied in the same way in the proposition.\nThus the word \"is\" appears as the copula, as the sign of equality, and as the expression of existence; \"to exist\" as an intransitive verb like \"to go\"; \"identical\" as an adjective; we speak of  something  but also of the fact of  something  happening.\n(In the proposition \"Green is green\"\u2014where the first word is a proper name as the last an adjective\u2014these words have not merely different meanings but they are  different symbols .)\n3.324  Thus there easily arise the most fundamental confusions (of which the whole of philosophy is full).\n3.325  In order to avoid these errors, we must employ a symbolism which excludes them, by not applying the same sign in different symbols and by not applying signs in the same way which signify in different ways. A symbolism, that is to say, which obeys the rules of  logical  grammar\u2014of logical syntax.\n(The logical symbolism of Frege and Russell is such a language, which, however, does still not exclude all errors.)&#32;   &#8203;\n3.326  In order to recognize the symbol in the sign we must consider the significant use.\n3.327  The sign determines a logical form only together with its logical syntactic application.\n3.328  If a sign is  not necessary  then it is meaningless. That is the meaning of Occam\u2019s razor.\n(If everything in the symbolism works as though a sign had meaning, then it has meaning.)\n3.33  In logical syntax the meaning of a sign ought never to play a r\u00f4le; it must admit of being established without mention being thereby made of the  meaning  of a sign; it ought to presuppose only the description of the expressions.\n3.331  From this observation we get a further view\u2014into Russell\u2019s  Theory of Types . Russell\u2019s error is shown by the fact that in drawing up his symbolic rules he has to speak about the things his signs mean.\n3.332  No proposition can say anything about itself, because the propositional sign cannot be contained in itself (that is the \u201cwhole theory of types\u201d).\n3.333  A function cannot be its own argument, because the functional sign already contains the prototype of its own argument and it cannot contain itself.\nIf, for example, we suppose that the function  F(fx)  could be its own argument, then there would be a proposition \u201c F(F(fx)) \u201d, and in this the outer function  F  and the inner function  F  must have different meanings; for the inner has the form  \u03d5(fx) , the outer the form  \u03c8(\u03d5(fx)) . Common to both functions is only the letter \u201c F \u201d, which by itself signifies nothing.\nThis is at once clear, if instead of \u201c F(F(u)) \u201d we write \u201c(\u2203\u03d5): F ( \u03d5u ). \u03d5u = Fu \u201d.\nHerewith Russell\u2019s paradox vanishes.&#32;   &#8203;\n3.334  The rules of logical syntax must follow of themselves, if we only know how every single sign signifies.\n3.34  A proposition possesses essential and accidental features.\nAccidental are the features which are due to a particular way of producing the propositional sign. Essential are those which alone enable the proposition to express its sense.\n3.341  The essential in a proposition is therefore that which is common to all propositions which can express the same sense.\nAnd in the same way in general the essential in a symbol is that which all symbols which can fulfil the same purpose have in common.\n3.3411  One could therefore say the real name is that which all symbols, which signify an object, have in common. It would then follow, step by step, that no sort of composition was essential for a name.\n3.342  In our notations there is indeed something arbitrary, but  this  is not arbitrary, namely that  if  we have determined anything arbitrarily, then something else  must  be the case. (This results from the  essence  of the notation.)\n3.3421  A particular method of symbolizing may be unimportant, but it is always important that this is a  possible  method of symbolizing. And this happens as a rule in philosophy: The single thing proves over and over again to be unimportant, but the possibility of every single thing reveals something about the nature of the world.\n3.343  Definitions are rules for the translation of one language into another. Every correct symbolism must be translatable into every other according to such rules. It is  this  which all have in common.\n3.344  What signifies in the symbol is what is common to all those symbols by which it can&#32;   &#8203;\nbe replaced according to the rules of logical syntax.\n3.3441  We can, for example, express what is common to all notations for the truth-functions as follows: It is common to them that they all, for example,  can be replaced  by the notations of \u201c~ p \u201d (\u201cnot  p \u201d) and \u201c p \u2228 q \u201d (\u201c p  or  q \u201d).\n(Herewith is indicated the way in which a special possible notation can give us general information.)\n3.3442  The sign of the complex is not arbitrarily resolved in the analysis, in such a way that its resolution would be different in every propositional structure.\n3.4  The proposition determines a place in logical space: the existence of this logical place is guaranteed by the existence of the constituent parts alone, by the existence of the significant proposition.\n3.41  The propositional sign and the logical co-ordinates: that is the logical place.\n3.411  The geometrical and the logical place agree in that each is the possibility of an existence.\n3.42  Although a proposition may only determine one place in logical space, the whole logical space must already be given by it.\n(Otherwise denial, the logical sum, the logical product, etc., would always introduce new elements\u2014in co-ordination.)\n(The logical scaffolding round the picture determines the logical space. The proposition reaches through the whole logical space.)\n3.5  The applied, thought, propositional sign, is the thought.\n&#32;\n--- Chapter 4 ---\n4  The thought is the significant proposition.\n4.001  The totality of propositions is the language.\n4.002  Man possesses the capacity of constructing languages, in which every sense can be expressed,&#32;   &#8203;   without having an idea how and what each word means\u2014just as one speaks without knowing how the single sounds are produced.\nColloquial language is a part of the human organism and is not less complicated than it.\nFrom it it is humanly impossible to gather immediately the logic of language.\nLanguage disguises the thought; so that from the external form of the clothes one cannot infer the form of the thought they clothe, because the external form of the clothes is constructed with quite another object than to let the form of the body be recognized.\nThe silent adjustments to understand colloquial language are enormously complicated.\n4.003  Most propositions and questions, that have been written about philosophical matters, are not false, but senseless. We cannot, therefore, answer questions of this kind at all, but only state their senselessness. Most questions and propositions of the philosophers result from the fact that we do not understand the logic of our language.\n(They are of the same kind as the question whether the Good is more or less identical than the Beautiful.)\nAnd so it is not to be wondered at that the deepest problems are really  no  problems.\n4.0031  All philosophy is \u201cCritique of language\u201d (but not at all in Mauthner\u2019s sense). Russell\u2019s merit is to have shown that the apparent logical form of the proposition need not be its real form.\n4.01  The proposition is a picture of reality.\nThe proposition is a model of the reality as we think it is.\n4.011  At the first glance the proposition\u2014say as it stands printed on paper\u2014does not seem to be&#32;   &#8203;   picture of the reality of which it treats. But nor does the musical score appear at first sight to be a picture of a musical piece; nor does our phonetic spelling (letters) seem to be a picture of our spoken language. And yet these symbolisms prove to be pictures\u2014even in the ordinary sense of the word\u2014of what they represent.\n4.012  It is obvious that we perceive a proposition of the form  aRb  as a picture. Here the sign is obviously a likeness of the signified.\n4.013  And if we penetrate to the essence of this pictorial nature we see that this is not disturbed by  apparent irregularities  (like the use of \u266f and \u266d in the score).\nFor these irregularities also picture what they are to express; only in another way.\n4.014  The gramophone record, the musical thought, the score, the waves of sound, all stand to one another in that pictorial internal relation, which holds between language and the world.\nTo all of them the logical structure is common.\n(Like the two youths, their two horses and their lilies in the story. They are all in a certain sense one.)\n4.0141  In the fact that there is a general rule by which the musician is able to read the symphony out of the score, and that there is a rule by which one could reconstruct the symphony from the line on a gramophone record and from this again\u2014by means of the first rule\u2014construct the score, herein lies the internal similarity between these things which at first sight seem to be entirely different. And the rule is the law of projection which projects the symphony into the language of the musical score. It is the rule of translation of this language into the language of the gramophone record.\n4.015  The possibility of all similes, of all the&#32;   &#8203;   imagery of our language, rests on the logic of representation.\n4.016  In order to understand the essence of the proposition, consider hieroglyphic writing, which pictures the facts it describes.\nAnd from it came the alphabet without the essence of the representation being lost.\n4.02  This we see from the fact that we understand the sense of the propositional sign, without having had it explained to us.\n4.021  The proposition is a picture of reality, for I know the state of affairs presented by it, if I understand the proposition. And I understand the proposition, without its sense having been explained to me.\n4.022  The proposition  shows  its sense.\nThe proposition  shows  how things stand,  if  it is true. And it  says , that they do so stand.\n4.023  The proposition determines reality to this extent, that one only needs to say \u201cYes\u201d or \u201cNo\u201d to it to make it agree with reality.\nReality must therefore be completely described by the proposition.\nA proposition is the description of a fact.\nAs the description of an object describes it by its external properties so propositions describe reality by its internal properties.\nThe proposition constructs a world with the help of a logical scaffolding, and therefore one can actually see in the proposition all the logical features possessed by reality  if  it is true. One can  draw conclusions  from a false proposition.\n4.024  To understand a proposition means to know what is the case, if it is true.\n(One can therefore understand it without knowing whether it is true or not.)\nOne understands it if one understands it constituent parts.\n4.025 The translation of one language into another&#32;   &#8203;   is not a process of translating each proposition of the one into a proposition of the other, but only the constituent parts of propositions are translated.\n(And the dictionary does not only translate substantives but also adverbs and conjunctions, etc., and it treats them all alike.)\n4.026  The meanings of the simple signs (the words) must be explained to us, if we are to understand them.\nBy means of propositions we explain ourselves.\n4.027  It is essential to propositions, that they can communicate a  new  sense to us.\n4.03  A proposition must communicate a new sense with old words.\nThe proposition communicates to us a state of affairs, therefore it must be  essentially  connected with the state of affairs.\nAnd the connexion is, in fact, that it is its logical picture.\nThe proposition only asserts something, in so far as it is a picture.\n4.031  In the proposition a state of affairs is, as it were, put together for the sake of experiment.\nOne can say, instead of, This proposition has such and such a sense, This proposition represents such and such a state of affairs.\n4.0311  One name stands for one thing, and another for another thing, and they are connected together. And so the whole, like a living picture, presents the atomic fact.\n4.0312  The possibility of propositions is based upon the principle of the representation of objects by signs.\nMy fundamental thought is that the \u201clogical constants\u201d do not represent. That the  logic  of the facts cannot be represented.\n4.032  The proposition is a picture of its state of affairs, only in so far as it is logically articulated.&#32;   &#8203;   (Even the proposition \u201cambulo\u201d is composite, for its stem gives a different sense with another termination, or its termination with another stem.)\n4.04  In the proposition there must be exactly as many thing distinguishable as there are in the state of affairs, which it represents.\nThey must both possess the same logical (mathematical) multiplicity (cf. Hertz\u2019s Mechanics, on Dynamic Models).\n4.041  This mathematical multiplicity naturally cannot in its turn be represented. One cannot get outside it in the representation.\n4.0411  If we tried, for example, to express what is expressed by \u201c( x ). fx \u201d by putting an index before  fx , like: \u201cGen. fx \u201d, it would not do, we should not know what was generalized. If we tried to show it by an index  g , like: \u201c f ( x g  )\u201d it would not do\u2014we should not know the scope of the generalization.\nIf we were to try it by introducing a mark in the argument places, like \u201c( G, G ). F ( G, G )\u201d, it would not do\u2014we could not determine the identity of the variables, etc.\nAll these ways of symbolizing are inadequate because they have not the necessary mathematical multiplicity.\n4.0412  For the same reason the idealist explanation of the seeing of spatial relations through \u201cspatial spectacles\u201d does not do, because it cannot explain the multiplicity of these relations.\n4.05  Reality is compared with the proposition.\n4.06  Propositions can be true or false only by being pictures of the reality.\n4.061  If one does not observe that propositions have a sense independent of the facts, one can easily believe that true and false are two relations&#32;   &#8203;   between signs and things signified with equal rights.\nOne could, then, for example, say that \u201c p \u201d signifies in the true way what \u201c ~p \u201d signifies in the false way, etc.\n4.062  Can we not make ourselves understood by means of false propositions as hitherto with true ones, so long as we know that they are meant to be false? No! For a proposition is true, if what we assert by means of it is the case; and if by \u201c p \u201d we mean  ~p , and what we mean is the case, then \u201c p \u201d in the new conception is true and not false.\n4.0621  That, however, the signs \u201c p \u201d and \u201c~ p \u201d can say the same thing is important, for it shows that the sign \u201c ~ \u201d corresponds to nothing in reality.\nThat negation occurs in a proposition, is no characteristic of its sense ( ~ ~p=p ).\nThe propositions \u201c p \u201d and \u201c ~p \u201d have opposite senses, but to them corresponds one and the same reality.\n4.063  An illustration to explain the concept of truth. A black spot on white paper; the form of the spot can be described by saying of each point of the plane whether it is white or black. To the fact that a point is black corresponds a positive fact; to the fact that a point is white (not black), a negative fact. If I indicate a point of the plane (a truth-value in Frege\u2019s terminology), this corresponds to the assumption proposed for judgment, etc. etc.\nBut to be able to say that a point is black or white, I must first know under what conditions a point is called white or black; in order to be able to say \u201c p \u201d is true (or false) I must have determined under what conditions I call \u201c p \u201d true,&#32;   &#8203;   and thereby I determine the sense of the proposition.\nThe point at which the simile breaks down is this: we can indicate a point on the paper, without knowing what white and black are; but to a proposition without a sense corresponds nothing at all, for it signifies no thing (truth-value) whose properties are called \u201cfalse\u201d or \u201ctrue\u201d; the verb of the proposition is not \u201cis true\u201d or \u201cis false\u201d\u2014as Frege thought\u2014but that which \u201cis true\u201d must already contain the verb.\n4.064  Every proposition must  already  have a sense; assertion cannot give it a sense, for what it asserts is the sense itself. And the same holds of denial, etc.\n4.0641  One could say, the denial is already related to the logical place determined by the proposition that is denied.\nThe denying proposition determines a logical place  other  than does the proposition denied.\nThe denying proposition determines a logical place, with the help of the logical place of the proposition denied, by saying that it lies outside the latter place.\nThat one can deny again the denied proposition, shows that what is denied is already a proposition and not merely the preliminary to a proposition.\n4.1  A proposition presents the existence and non-existence of atomic facts.\n4.11  The totality of true propositions is the total natural science (or the totality of the natural sciences).\n4.111  Philosophy is not one of the natural sciences.\n(The word \u201cphilosophy\u201d must mean something&#32;   &#8203;   which stands above or below, but not beside the natural sciences.)\n4.112  The object of philosophy is the logical clarification of thoughts.\nPhilosophy is not a theory but an activity.\nA philosophical work consists essentially of elucidations.\nThe result of philosophy is not a number of \u201cphilosophical propositions\u201d, but to make propositions clear.\nPhilosophy should make clear and delimit sharply the thoughts which otherwise are, as it were, opaque and blurred.\n4.1121  Psychology is no nearer related to philosophy, than is any other natural science.\nThe theory of knowledge is the philosophy of psychology.\nDoes not my study of sign-language correspond to the study of thought processes which philosophers held to be so essential to the philosophy of logic? Only they got entangled for the most part in unessential psychological investigations, and there is an analogous danger for my method.\n4.1122  The Darwinian theory has no more to do with philosophy than has any other hypothesis of natural science.\n4.113  Philosophy limits the disputable sphere of natural science.\n4.114  It should limit the thinkable and thereby the unthinkable.\nIt should limit the unthinkable from within through the thinkable.\n4.115  It will mean the unspeakable by clearly displaying the speakable.\n4.116  Everything that can be thought at all can be&#32;   &#8203;   thought clearly. Everything that can be said can be said clearly.\n4.12  Propositions can represent the whole reality, but they cannot represent what they must have in common with reality in order to be able to represent it\u2014the logical form.\nTo be able to represent the logical form, we should have to be able to put ourselves with the propositions outside logic, that is outside the world.\n4.121  Propositions cannot represent the logical form: this mirrors itself in the propositions.\nThat which mirrors itself in language, language cannot represent.\nThat which expresses  itself  in language,  we  cannot express by language.\nThe propositions  show  the logical form of reality.\nThey exhibit it.\n4.1211  Thus a proposition \u201c fa \u201d shows that in its sense the object  a  occurs, two propositions \u201c fa \u201d and \u201c ga \u201d that they are both about the same object.\nIf two propositions contradict one another, this is shown by their structure; similarly if one follows from another, etc.\n4.1212  What  can  be shown  cannot  be said.\n4.1213  Now we understand our feeling that we are in possession of the right logical conception, if only all is right in our symbolism.\n4.122  We can speak in a certain sense of formal properties of objects and atomic facts, or of properties of the structure of facts, and in the same sense of formal relations and relations of structures.\n(Instead of property of the structure I also say&#32;   &#8203;   \u201cinternal property\u201d; instead of relation of structures \u201cinternal relation\u201d.\nI introduce these expressions in order to show the reason for the confusion, very widespread among philosophers, between internal relations and proper (external) relations.)\nThe holding of such internal properties and relations cannot, however, be asserted by propositions, but it shows itself in the propositions, which present the facts and treat of the objects in question.\n4.1221  An internal property of a fact we also call a feature of this fact. (In the sense in which we speak of facial features.)\n4.123  A property is internal if it is unthinkable that its object does not possess it.\n(This blue colour and that stand in the internal relation of brighter and darker eo ipso. It is unthinkable that  these  two objects should not stand in this relation.)\n(Here to the shifting use of the words \u201cproperty\u201d and \u201crelation\u201d there corresponds the shifting use of the word \u201cobject\u201d.)\n4.124  The existence of an internal property of a possible state of affairs is not expressed by a proposition, but it expresses itself in the proposition which presents that state of affairs, by an internal property of this proposition.\nIt would be as senseless to ascribe a formal property to a proposition as to deny it the formal property.\n4.1241  One cannot distinguish forms from one another by saying that one has this property, the other that: for this assumes that there is a sense in asserting either property of either form.\n4.125  The existence of an internal relation between&#32;   &#8203;   possible states of affairs expresses itself in language by an internal relation between the propositions presenting them.\n4.1251  Now this settles the disputed question \u201cwhether all relations are internal or external\u201d.\n4.1252  Series which are ordered by  internal  relations I call formal series.\nThe series of numbers is ordered not by an external, but by an internal relation.\nSimilarly the series of propositions \u201c aRb \u201d,\n\u201c(\u2203 x ): aRx.xRb \u201d,\n\u201c(\u2203 x,y ): aRx.xRy.yRb \u201d, etc.\n(If  b  stands in one of these relations to  a , I call  b  a successor of  a .)\n4.126  In the sense in which we speak of formal properties we can now speak also of formal concepts.\n(I introduce this expression in order to make clear the confusion of formal concepts with proper concepts which runs through the whole of the old logic.)\nThat anything falls under a formal concept as an object belonging to it, cannot be expressed by a proposition. But it is shown in the symbol for the object itself. (The name shows that it signifies an object, the numerical sign that it signifies a number, etc.)\nFormal concepts, cannot, like proper concepts, be presented by a function.\nFor their characteristics, the formal properties, are not expressed by the functions.\nThe expression of a formal property is a feature of certain symbols.\nThe sign that signifies the characteristics of a formal concept is, therefore, a characteristic feature of all symbols, whose meanings fall under the concept.&#32;   &#8203;   The expression of the formal concept is therefore a propositional variable in which only this characteristic feature is constant.\n4.127  The propositional variable signifies the formal concept, and its values signify the objects which fall under this concept.\n4.1271  Every variable is the sign of a formal concept.\nFor every variable presents a constant form, which all its values possess, and which can be conceived as a formal property of these values.\n4.1272  So the variable name \u201c x \u201d is the proper sign of the pseudo-concept  object .\nWherever the word \u201cobject\u201d (\u201cthing\u201d, \u201centity\u201d, etc.) is rightly used, it is expressed in logical symbolism by the variable name.\nFor example in the proposition \u201cthere are two objects which \u2026\u201d, by \u201c(\u2203x,y)\u2026\u201d.\nWherever it is used otherwise,  i.e.  as a proper concept word, there arise senseless pseudo-propositions.\nSo one cannot,  e.g.  say \u201cThere are objects\u201d as one says \u201cThere are books\u201d. Nor \u201cThere are 100 objects\u201d or \u201cThere are \u2135 0  objects\u201d.\nAnd it is senseless to speak of the  number of all objects.\nThe same holds of the words \u201cComplex\u201d, \u201cFact\u201d, \u201cFunction\u201d, \u201cNumber\u201d, etc.\nThey all signify formal concepts and are presented in logical symbolism by variables, not by functions or classes (as Frege and Russell thought).\nExpressions like \u201c1 is a number\u201d, \u201cthere is only one number nought\u201d, and all like them are senseless.\n(It is as senseless to say, \u201cthere is only one 1\u201d&#32;   &#8203;   as it would be to say: 2+2 is at 3 o\u2019clock equal to 4.)\n4.12721  The formal concept is already given with an object, which falls under it. One cannot, therefore, introduce both, the objects which fall under a formal concept  and  the formal concept itself, as primitive ideas. One cannot, therefore,  e.g.  introduce (as Russell does) the concept of function and also special functions as primitive ideas; or the concept of number and definite numbers.\n4.1273  If we want to express in logical symbolism the general proposition \u201c b  is a successor of  a \u201d we need for this an expression for the general term of the formal series:  aRb , (\u2203 x ): aRx.xRb , (\u2203 x,y ): aRx.xRy.yRb ,\u2026 The general term of a formal series can only be expressed by a variable, for the concept symbolized by \u201cterm of this formal series\u201d is a  formal  concept. (This Frege and Russell overlooked; the way in which they express general propositions like the above is, therefore, false; it contains a vicious circle.)\nWe can determine the general term of the formal series by giving its first term and the general form of the operation, which generates the following term out of the preceding proposition.\n4.1274  The question about the existence of a formal concept is senseless. For no proposition can answer such a question.\n(For example, one cannot ask: \u201cAre there unanalysable subject-predicate propositions?\u201d)\n4.128  The logical forms are  anumerical .\nTherefore there are in logic no pre-eminent numbers, and therefore there is no philosophical monism or dualism, etc.\n4.2  The sense of a proposition is its agreement and disagreement with the possibilities of the&#32;   &#8203;   existence and non-existence of the atomic facts.\n4.21  The simplest proposition, the elementary proposition, asserts the existence of an atomic fact.\n4.211  It is a sign of an elementary proposition, that no elementary proposition can contradict it.\n4.22  The elementary proposition consists of names. It is a connexion, a concatenation, of names.\n4.221  It is obvious that in the analysis of propositions we must come to elementary propositions, which consist of names in immediate combination.\nThe question arises here, how the propositional connexion comes to be.\n4.2211  Even if the world is infinitely complex, so that every fact consists of an infinite number of atomic facts and every atomic fact is composed of an infinite number of objects, even then there must be objects and atomic facts.\n4.23  The name occurs in the proposition only in the context of the elementary proposition.\n4.24  The names are the simple symbols, I indicate them by single letters ( x, y, z ).\nThe elementary proposition I write as function of the names, in the form \u201c fx \u201d, \u201c \u03d5 ( x,y )\u201d, etc.\nOr I indicate it by the letters  p, q, r .\n4.241  If I use two signs with one and the same meaning, I express this by putting between them the sign \u201c=\u201d.\n\u201c a=b \u201d means then, that the sign \u201c a \u201d is replaceable by the sign \u201c b \u201d.\n(If I introduce by an equation a new sign \u201c b \u201d, by determining that it shall replace a previously known sign \u201c a \u201d, I write the equation\u2014definition&#32;   &#8203;   \u2014(like Russell) in the form \u201c a=b  Def.\u201d. A definition is a symbolic rule.)\n4.242  Expressions of the form \u201c a=b \u201d are therefore only expedients in presentation: They assert nothing about the meaning of the signs \u201c a \u201d and \u201c b \u201d.\n4.243  Can we understand two names without knowing whether they signify the same thing or two different things? Can we understand a proposition in which two names occur, without knowing if they mean the same or different things?\nIf I know the meaning of an English and a synonymous German word, it is impossible for me not to know that they are synonymous, it is impossible for me not to be able to translate them into one another.\nExpressions like \u201c a=a \u201d, or expressions deduced from these are neither elementary propositions nor otherwise significant signs. (This will be shown later.)\n4.25  If the elementary proposition is true, the atomic fact exists; if it is false the atomic fact does not exist.\n4.26  The specification of all true elementary propositions describes the world completely. The world is completely described by the specification of all elementary propositions plus the specification, which of them are true and which false.\n4.27  With regard to the existence of n atomic facts there are\nK\nn\n=\n&#x2211;\nv\n=\n0\nn\n(\nn\nv\n)\n{\\displaystyle \\mathbf {K} _{n}=\\sum _{v=0}^{n}{\\binom {n}{v}}}\npossibilities.\nIt is possible for all combinations of atomic facts to exist, and the others not to exist.\n4.28  To these combinations correspond the same number of possibilities of the truth\u2014and falsehood\u2014of  n  elementary propositions.\n4.3  The truth-possibilities of the elementary propositions mean the possibilities of the existence and non-existence of the atomic facts.&#32;   &#8203;\n4.31  The truth-possibilities can be presented by\nschemata of the following kind (\"T\" means\n\"true\", \"F\" \"false\". The rows of T's and F's\nunder the row of the elementary propositions mean\ntheir truth-possibilities in an easily intelligible\nsymbolism).\np\nq\nr\nT\nT\nT\nF\nT\nT\nT\nF\nT\nT\nT\nF\nF\nF\nT\nF\nT\nF\nT\nF\nF\nF\nF\nF\np\nq\nT\nT\nF\nT\nT\nF\nF\nF\np\nT\nF\n4.4  A proposition is the expression of agreement\nand disagreement with the truth-possibilities of\nthe elementary propositions.\n4.41  The truth-possibilities of the elementary propositions are the conditions of the truth and\nfalsehood of the propositions.\n.411  It seems probable even at first sight that the\nintroduction of the elementary propositions is\nfundamental for the comprehension of the other\nkinds of propositions. Indeed the comprehension\nof the general propositions depends  palpably  on\nthat of the elementary propositions.\n4.42  With regard to the agreement and disagreement of a proposition with the truth-possibilities of n elementary propositions there are\n&#x2211;\nK\n=\n0\nK\nn\n(\nK\nn\n&#x03BA;\n)\n=\nL\nn\n{\\displaystyle \\sum _{K=0}^{K_{n}}{K_{n} \\choose \\kappa }=L_{n}}\npossibilities.\nAgreement with the truth-possibilities can be&#32;   &#8203;   expressed by co-ordinating with them in the\nschema the mark \"T\" (true).\nAbsence of this mark means disagreement.\n4.431  The expression of the agreement and disagreement with the truth-possibilities of the elementary-propositions expresses the truth-conditions of the\nproposition.\nThe proposition is the expression of its truth-\nconditions.\n(Frege has therefore quite rightly put them at\nthe beginning, as explaining the signs of his\nlogical symbolism. Only Frege's explanation\nof the truth-concept is false: if \"the true\" and\n\"the false\" were real objects and the arguments\nin ~ p  etc., then the sense of ~ p  would by no\nmeans be determined by Frege's determination.)\n4.44  The sign which arises from the co-ordination of\nthat mark \"T\" with the truth-possibilities is a\npropositional sign.\n4.441  It is clear that to the complex of the signs \"F\"\nand \"T\" no object (or complex of objects) corresponds; any more than to horizontal and vertical\nlines or to brackets. There are no \"logical\nobjects\".\nSomething analogous holds of course for all\nsigns, which express the same as the schemata of\n\"T\"and \"F\".\n4.442  Thus e.g.\n\"\np\nq\nT\nT\nT\nF\nT\nT\nT\nF\nF\nF\nT \"\n\"\nis a propositional sign.\n(Frege's assertion sign \" |- \" is logically altogether&#32;   &#8203;   meaningless; in Frege (and Russell) it only shows\nthat these authors hold as true the propositions\nmarked in this way.\n\"|-\" belongs therefore to the propositions no\nmore than does the number of the proposition. A\nproposition cannot possibly assert of itself that it\nis true.)\nIf the sequence of the truth-possibilities in the\nschema is once for all determined by a rule of\ncombination, then the last column is by itself an\nexpression of the truth-conditions. If we write\nthis column as a row the propositional sign becomes:\n\"(T\u2014T) ( p,q )\" or more plainly: \"(T T F T) ( p,q )\".\n(The number of places in the left-hand bracket\nis determined by the number of terms in the right-hand bracket.)\n4.45  For  n  elementary propositions there are  L n\npossible groups of truth-conditions.\nThe groups of truth-conditions which belong to\nthe truth-possibilities of a number of elementary\npropositions can be ordered in a series.\n4.46  Among the possible groups of truth-conditions\nthere are two extreme cases.\nIn the one case the proposition is true for all the\ntruth-possibilities of the elementary propositions.\nWe say that the truth-conditions are  tautological .\nIn the second case the proposition is false for all\nthe truth-possibilities. The truth-conditions are\nself-contradictory .\nIn the first case we call the proposition a\ntautology, in the second case a contradiction.\n4.461  The proposition shows what it says, the\ntautology and the contradiction that they say\nnothing.\nThe tautology has no truth-conditions, for it is&#32;   &#8203;   unconditionally true; and the contradiction is on\nno condition true.\nTautology and contradiction are without sense.\n(Like the point from which two arrows go out in\nopposite directions.)\n(I know,  e.g.  nothing about the weather, when\nI know that it rains or does not rain.)\n4.4611  Tautology and contradiction are, however, not\nnonsensical ; they are part of the symbolism, in the\nsame way that \"0\" is part of the symbolism of\nArithmetic.\n4.462  Tautology and contradiction are not pictures of\nthe reality. They present no possible state of\naffairs. For the one allows  every  possible state\nof affairs, the other  none .\nIn the tautology the conditions of agreement\nwith the world \u2014 the presenting relations \u2014 cancel\none another, so that it stands in no presenting\nrelation to reality.\n4.463  The truth-conditions determine the range, which\nis left to the facts by the proposition.\n(The proposition, the picture, the model, are in\na negative sense like a solid body, which restricts\nthe free movement of another: in a positive sense,\nlike the space limited by solid substance, in which\na body may be placed.)\nTautology leaves to reality the whole infinite\nlogical space; contradiction fills the whole logical\nspace and leaves no point to reality. Neither of\nthem, therefore, can in any way determine\nreality.\n4.464  The truth of tautology is certain, of propositions\npossible, of contradiction impossible.\n(Certain, possible, impossible: here we have\nan indication of that gradation which we need in\nthe theory of probability.)\n4.465  The logical product of a tautology and a &#32;   &#8203;   proposition says the same as the proposition. Therefore that product is identical with the proposition.\nFor the essence of the symbol cannot be altered\nwithout altering its sense.\n4.466  To a definite logical combination of signs\ncorresponds a definite logical combination of their\nmeanings;  every arbitrary  combination only corre-\nsponds to the unconnected signs.\nThat is, propositions which are true for every\nstate of affairs cannot be combinations of signs at\nall, for otherwise there could only correspond to\nthem definite combinations of objects.\n(And to no logical combination corresponds  no\ncombination of the objects.)\nTautology and contradiction are the limiting\ncases of the combinations of symbols, namely their\ndissolution.\n4.4661  Of course the signs are also combined with one\nanother in the tautology and contradiction,  i.e.\nthey stand in relations to one another, but these\nrelations are meaningless, unessential to the\nsymbol .\n4.5  Now it appears to be possible to give the\nmost general form of proposition;  i.e.  to give a\ndescription of the propositions of some one sign\nlanguage, so that every possible sense can be\nexpressed by a symbol, which falls under the\ndescription, and so that every symbol which falls\nunder the description can express a sense, if\nthe meanings of the names are chosen accordingly.\nIt is clear that in the description of the most\ngeneral form of proposition  only  what is essential\nto it may be described \u2014 otherwise it would not be\nthe most general form.\nThat there is a general form is proved by the\nfact that there cannot be a proposition whose\nform could not have been foreseen ( i.e.  constructed).&#32;   &#8203;   The general form of proposition is: Such and such is the case.\n4.51  Suppose  all  elementary propositions were given me: then we can simply ask: what propositions I can build out of them. And these are  all  propositions and  so  are they limited.\n4.52  The propositions are everything which follows from the totality of all elementary propositions (of course also from the fact that it is the  totality of them all ). (So, in some sense, one could say, that  all  propositions are generalizations of the elementary propositions.)\n4.53  The general propositional form is a variable.\n&#32;\n--- Chapter 5 ---\n5  Propositions are truth-functions of elementary propositions.\n(An elementary proposition is a truth-function of itself.)\n5.01  The elementary propositions are the truth-arguments of propositions.\n5.02  It is natural to confuse the arguments of functions with the indices of names. For I recognize the meaning of the sign containing it from the argument just as much as from the index.\nIn Russell's \"+ c \", for example, \"c\" is an index which indicates that the whole sign is the addition sign for cardinal numbers. But this way of symbolizing depends on arbitrary agreement, and one could choose a simple sign instead of \"+ c \": but in \"~ p \" \" p \" is not an index but an argument; the sense of \"~ p \" cannot be understood, unless the sense of \" p \" has previously been understood. (In the name Julius Caesar, Julius is an index. The index is always part of a description of the object to whose name we attach it, e.g.  The  Caesar of the Julian gens.)\nThe confusion of argument and index is, if I am not mistaken, at the root of Frege's theory&#32;   &#8203;   of the meaning of propositions and functions.

And similarly he could not create a world\nin which the proposition \" p \" is true without\ncreating all its objects.\n5.124  A proposition asserts every proposition which\nfollows from it.\n5.1241  \" p.q \" is one of the propositions which assert\n\" p \" and at the same time one of the propositions\nwhich assert \" q \".\nTwo propositions are opposed to one another\nif there is no significant proposition which asserts\nthem both.\nEvery proposition which contradicts another,\ndenies it.\n5.13  That the truth of one proposition follows from\nthe truth of other propositions, we perceive from\nthe structure of the propositions.\n5.131  If the truth of one proposition follows from the\ntruth of others, this expresses itself in relations in\nwhich the forms of these propositions stand to one\nanother, and we do not need to put them in these\nrelations first by connecting them with one another\nin a proposition; for these relations are internal,\nand exist as soon as, and by the very fact that,\nthe propositions exist.\n5.1311  When we conclude from  p v q  and ~ p  to  q  the\nrelation between the forms of the propositions\n\" p v q \" and \"~ p \" is here concealed by the method\nof symbolizing. But if we write,  e.g.  instead of\n\" p v q \" \" p | q  .|.  p | q \" and instead of \"~ p \"\n\" p | p \" ( p | q  = neither  p  nor  q ), then the inner connexion becomes obvious.\n&#32;   &#8203;   (The fact that we can infer  fa  from (x) fx  shows\nthat generality is present also in the symbol \"( x ). fx \".\n5.132  If  p  follows from  q , I can conclude from  qp  to  p ;\ninfer  p  from  q .\nThe method of inference is to be understood\nfrom the two propositions alone.\nOnly they themselves can justify the inference.\nLaws of inference, which\u2014as in Frege and\nRussell\u2014are to justify the conclusions, are senseless and would be superfluous.\n5.133  All inference takes place a priori.\n5.134  From an elementary proposition no other can\nbe inferred.\n5.135  In no way can an inference be made from the\nexistence of one state of affairs to the existence of\nanother entirely different from it.\n5.136  There is no causal nexus which justifies such\nan inference.\n5.1361  The events of the future  cannot  be inferred from\nthose of the present.\nSuperstition is the belief in the causal nexus.\n5.1362  The freedom of the will consists in the fact that\nfuture actions cannot be known now. We could\nonly know them if causality were an  inner  necessity,\nlike that of logical deduction.\u2014The connexion\nof knowledge and what is known is that of logical\nnecessity.\n(\"A knows that  p  is the case*' is senseless if  p\nis a tautology.)\n5.1363  If from the fact that a proposition is obvious\nto us it does not  follow  that it is true, then obviousness is no justification for our belief in its truth.\n5.14  If a proposition follows from another, then the\nlatter says more than the former, the former less\nthan the latter.\n&#32;   &#8203;\n5.141  If  p  follows from  q  and  q  from  p  then they are\none and the same proposition.\n5.142  A tautology follows from all propositions: it\nsays nothing.\n5.143  Contradiction is something shared by propositions, which  no  proposition has in common with\nanother. Tautology is that which is shared by\nall propositions, which have nothing in common\nwith one another.\nContradiction vanishes so to speak outside,\ntautology inside all propositions.\nContradiction is the external limit of the propositions, tautology their substanceless centre.\n5.15  If  T r   is the number of the truth-grounds of the\nproposition \" r \",  T rs   the number of those truth-grounds of the proposition \" s \" which are at the\nsame time truth-grounds of \" r \", then we call the\nratio  T rs :T r   the measure of the  probability  which\nthe proposition \" r \" gives to the proposition \" s \".\n5.151  Suppose in a schema like that above in No.\n5.101  T r   is the number of the \"T\"'s in the proposition  r ,  T rs   the number of those \"T\"'s in\nthe proposition  s , which stand in the same columns\nas \"T\"'s of the proposition  r ; then the proposition  r  gives to the proposition  s  the probability\nT rs : T r .\n5.1511  There is no special object peculiar to probability\npropositions.\n5.152  Propositions which have no truth-arguments\nin common with one another we call independent.\nTwo elementary propositions give to one another\nthe probability \u00bd.\nIf  p  follows from  q , the proposition  q  gives\nto the proposition  p  the probability 1. The\ncertainty of logical conclusion is a limiting case\nof probability.\n(Application to tautology and contradiction.)\n5.153  A proposition is in itself neither probable nor&#32;   &#8203;   improbable. An event occurs or does not occur,\nthere is no middle course.\n5.154  In an urn there are equal numbers of white\nand black balls (and no others). I draw one\nball after another and put them back in the\nurn. Then I can determine by the experiment\nthat the numbers of the black and white balls\nwhich are drawn approximate as the drawing\ncontinues.\nSo  this  is not a mathematical fact.\nIf then, I say, It is equally probable that\nI should draw a white and a black ball, this\nmeans, All the circumstances known to me (including the natural laws hypothetically assumed)\ngive to the occurrence of the one event no more\nprobability than to the occurrence of the other.\nThat is they give\u2014as can easily be understood from the above explanations\u2014to each the\nprobability \u00bd.\nWhat I can verify by the experiment is that\nthe occurrence of the two events is independent\nof the circumstances with which I have no closer\nacquaintance.\n5.155  The unit of the probability proposition is: The\ncircumstances\u2014with which I am not further acquainted\u2014give to the occurrence of a definite event\nsuch and such a degree of probability.\n5.156  Probability is a generalization.\nIt involves a general description of a propositional form. Only in default of certainty do we\nneed probability.\nIf we are not completely acquainted with a fact,\nbut know  something  about its form.\n(A proposition can, indeed, be an incomplete\npicture of a certain state of affairs, but it is always  a  complete picture.)\n&#32;   &#8203;   The probability proposition is, as it were, an\nextract from other propositions.\n5.2  The structures of propositions stand to one\nanother in internal relations.\n5.21  We can bring out these internal relations in\nour manner of expression, by presenting a proposition as the result\nof an operation which produces it from other propositions (the bases of the\noperation).\n5.22  The operation is the expression of a relation\nbetween the structures of its result and its\nbases.\n5.23  The operation is that which must happen to a\nproposition in order to make another out of it.\n5.231  And that will naturally depend on their formal\nproperties, on the internal similarity of their\nforms.\n5.232  The internal relation which orders a series is\nequivalent to the operation by which one term\narises from another.\n5.233  The first place in which an operation can occur\nis where a proposition arises from another in a\nlogically significant way;  i.e.  where the logical\nconstruction of the proposition begins.\n5.234  The truth-functions of elementary proposition,\nare results of operations which have the elementary propositions as bases. (I call these\noperations, truth-operations.)\n5.2341  The sense of a truth-function of  p  is a function\nof the sense of  p .\nDenial, logical addition, logical multiplication,\netc. etc., are operations.\n(Denial reverses the sense of a proposition.)\n5.24  An operation shows itself in a variable; it shows\nhow we can proceed from one form of proposition\nto another.\nIt gives expression to the difference between\nthe forms.\n&#32;   &#8203;   (And that which is common to the bases, and\nthe result of an operation, is the bases themselves.)\n5.241  The operation does not characterize a form but\nonly the difference between forms.\n5.242  The same operation which makes \" q \" from\n\" p \", makes \" r \" from \" q \", and so on. This\ncan only be expressed by the fact that \" p \", \" q \",\n\" r \", etc., are variables which give general expression to certain formal relations.\n5.25  The occurrence of an operation does not characterize the sense of a proposition.\nFor an operation does not assert anything; only\nits result does, and this depends on the bases of\nthe operation.\n(Operation and function must not be confused\nwith one another.)\n5.251  A function cannot be its own argument, but\nthe result of an operation can be its own\nbasis.\n5.252  Only in this way is the progress from term\nto term in a formal series possible (from type\nto type in the hierarchy of Russell and Whitehead). (Russell and Whitehead have not admitted\nthe possibility of this progress but have made use\nof it all the same.)\n5.2521  The repeated application of an operation to\nits own result I call its successive application\n(\" O' O' O' a \" is the result of the threefold successive application of \" O' \u03be \" to \" a \").\nIn a similar sense I speak of the successive\napplication of  several  operations to a number of\npropositions.\n5.2522  The general term of the formal series  a, O', a, O' O' a,  ... I write thus: \"[ a, x, O' x ]\". This\nexpression in brackets is a variable. The first\nterm of the expression is the beginning of the&#32;   &#8203;   formal series, the second the form of an arbitrary\nterm  x  of the series, and the third the form\nof that term of the series which immediately\nfollows  x .\n5.2523  The concept of the successive application of\nan operation is equivalent to the concept \"and\nso on\".\n5.253  One operation can reverse the effect of another.\nOperations can cancel one another.\n5.254  Operations can vanish ( e.g.  denial in \"~ ~  p \".\n~ ~  p = p ).\n5.3  All propositions are results of truth-operations\non the elementary propositions.\nThe truth - operation is the way in which a\ntruth - function arises from elementary propositions.\nAccording to the nature of truth-operations,\nin the same way as out of elementary propositions arise their truth-functions, from truth-functions arises a new one. Every truth-operation\ncreates from truth-functions of elementary propositions another truth-function of elementary\npropositions,  i.e. , a proposition. The result of\nevery truth-operation on the results of truth-operations on elementary propositions is also\nthe result of  one  truth-operation on elementary\npropositions.\nEvery proposition is the result of truth-operations on elementary propositions.\n5.31  The Schemata No. 4.31 are also significant, if\n\" p \", \" q \", \" r \", etc. are not elementary propositions.\nAnd it is easy to see that the propositional\nsign in No. 4.42 expresses one truth-function of\nelementary propositions even when \" p \" and\n\" q \" are truth-functions of elementary propositions.\n5.32  All truth-functions are results of the successive&#32;   &#8203;   application of a finite number of truth-operations\nto elementary propositions.\n5.4  Here it becomes clear that there are no such\nthings as \"logical objects\" or \"logical constants\"\n(in the sense of Frege and Russell).\n5.41  For all those results of truth-operations on truth-functions are identical, which are one and the same\ntruth-function of elementary propositions.\n5.42  That \u2228, \u2283 etc., are not relations in the sense of\nright and left, etc., is obvious.\nThe possibility of crosswise definition of the\nlogical \"primitive signs\" of Frege and Russell\nshows by itself that these are not primitive signs\nand that they signify no relations.\nAnd it is obvious that the \"\u2283\" which we define\nby means of \"~\" and \"\u2228\" is identical with that\nby which we define \"\u2228\" with the help of \"~\", and\nthat this \"\u2228\" is the same as the first, and\nso on.\n5.43  That from a fact  p  an infinite number of  others\nshould follow, namely ~ ~ p , ~ ~ ~ ~ p  etc., is\nindeed hardly to be believed, and it is no less\nwonderful that the infinite number of propositions\nof logic (of mathematics) should follow from half\na dozen \"primitive propositions\".\nBut all propositions of logic say the same thing.\nThat is, nothing.\n5.44  Truth-functions are not material functions.\nIf  e.g.  an affirmation can be produced by\nrepeated denial, is the denial\u2014in any sense\u2014contained in the affirmation?\nDoes \" ~ ~p \" deny ~ p , or does it affirm  p ;\nor both?\nThe proposition \" ~ ~p \" does not treat of\ndenial as an object, but the possibility of denial is\nalready prejudged in affirmation.\nAnd if there was an object called \"~\", then&#32;   &#8203;   \"~ ~ p \" would have to say something other than\n\" p \". For the one proposition would then treat\nof ~ , the other would not.\n5.441  This disappearance of the apparent logical\nconstants also occurs if \"\n&#xA0;\n(\n&#x2203;\nx\n)\n&#xA0;\nf\nx\n{\\displaystyle ~(\\exists x)~fx}\n\" says the\nsame as \"\n&#xA0;\n(\nx\n)\n&#xA0;\nf\nx\n{\\displaystyle ~(x)~fx}\n\", or \"\n&#xA0;\n(\n&#x2203;\nx\n)\n.\nf\nx\n.\nx\n=\na\n{\\displaystyle ~(\\exists x).fx.x=a}\n\" the same\nas  fa .\n5.442  If a proposition is given to us then the results\nof all truth-operations which have it as their basis\nare given  with  it.\n5.45  If there are logical primitive signs a correct logic\nmust make clear their position relative to one\nanother and justify their existence. The construction of logic  out of  its primitive signs must become\nclear.\n5.451  If logic has primitive ideas these must be\nindependent of one another. If a primitive idea\nis introduced it must be introduced in all contexts\nin which it occurs at all. One cannot therefore\nintroduce it for one context and then again for\nanother. For example, if denial is introduced,\nwe must understand it in propositions of the form\n\"~ p \" just as in propositions like \"~( p v q )\",\n\"\n&#xA0;\n(\n&#x2203;\nx\n)\n.\n&#xA0;\nf\nx\n{\\displaystyle ~(\\exists x).~fx}\n\" and others. We may not first\nintroduce it for one class of cases and then for\nanother, for it would then remain doubtful whether\nits meaning in the two cases was the same, and\nthere would be no reason to use the same way of\nsymbolizing in the two cases.\n(In short, what Frege (\"Grundgesetze der\nArithmetik\") has said about the introduction of\nsigns by definitions holds, mutatis mutandis, for\nthe introduction of primitive signs also.)\n5.452  The introduction of a new expedient in the\nsymbolism of logic must always be an event full\nof consequences. No new symbol may be introduced in logic in brackets or in the margin\u2014with,\nso to speak, an entirely innocent face.&#32;   &#8203;   (Thus in the \"Principia Mathematica\" of\nRussell and Whitehead there occur definitions\nand primitive propositions in words. Why suddenly words here? This would need a justification. There was none, and can be none for the\nprocess is actually not allowed.)\nBut if the introduction of a new expedient has\nproved necessary in one place, we must immediately ask: Where is this expedient  always  to be\nused? Its position in logic must be made\nclear.\n5.453  All numbers in logic must be capable of justification.\nOr rather it must become plain that there are\nno numbers in logic.\nThere are no pre-eminent numbers.\n5.454  In logic there is no side by side, there can be no classification.\nIn logic there cannot be a more general and a\nmore special.\n5.4541  The solution of logical problems must be neat\nfor they set the standard of neatness.\nMen have always thought that there must be a sphere of questions whose answers\u2014a priori\u2014are symmetrical and united into a closed regular structure.\nA sphere in which the proposition, simplex\nsigillum veri, is valid.\n5.46  When we have rightly introduced the logical\nsigns, the sense of all their combinations has been\nalready introduced with them: therefore not only\n\" p v q \" butalso \"~( p v~ q )\", etc. etc. We should\nthen already have introduced the effect of all\npossible combinations of brackets ; and it would\nthen have become clear that the proper general\nprimitive signs are not \" p v q \", \"\n&#xA0;\n(\n&#x2203;\nx\n)\n.\nf\nx\n{\\displaystyle ~(\\exists x).fx}\n\", etc.,&#32;   &#8203;   but the most general form of their combinations.\n5.461  The apparently unimportant fact that the apparent relations like\n&#x2228;\n{\\displaystyle \\lor }\nand\n&#x2283;\n{\\displaystyle \\supset }\nneed brackets\u2014unlike real relations\u2014is of great importance.\nThe use of brackets with these apparent primitive signs shows that these are not the real\nprimitive signs; and nobody of course would\nbelieve that the brackets have meaning by themselves.\n5.4611  Logical operation signs are punctuations.\n5.47  It is clear that everything which can be said\nbeforehand  about the form of  all  propositions at\nall can be said  on one occasion .\nFor all logical operations are already contained\nin the elementary proposition. For \"\nf\na\n{\\displaystyle fa}\n\" says\nthe same as \"\n&#xA0;\n(\n&#x2203;\nx\n)\n.\nf\nx\n.\nx\n=\na\n{\\displaystyle ~(\\exists x).fx.x=a}\n\".\nWhere there is composition, there is argument\nand function, and where these are, all logical\nconstants already are.\nOne could say: the one logical constant is that\nwhich  all  propositions, according to their nature,\nhave in common with one another.\nThat however is the general form of proposition.\n5.471  The general form of proposition is the essence\nof proposition.\n5.4711  To give the essence of proposition means to\ngive the essence of all description, therefore the\nessence of the world.\n5.472  The description of the most general propositional form is the description of the one and only\ngeneral primitive sign in logic.\n5.473  Logic must take care of itself.\nA  possible  sign must also be able to signify.\nEverything which is possible in logic is also\npermitted. (\"Socrates is identical \" means nothing&#32;   &#8203;   because there is no property which is called\n\"identical\". The proposition is senseless because\nwe have not made some arbitrary determination,\nnot because the symbol is in itself unpermissible.)\nIn a certain sense we cannot make mistakes in\nlogic.\n5.4731  Self-evidence, of which Russell has said so\nmuch, can only be discarded in logic by language\nitself preventing every logical mistake. That\nlogic is a priori consists in the fact that we  cannot\nthink illogically.\n5.4732  We cannot give a sign the wrong sense.\n5.47321  Occam's razor is, of course, not an arbitrary rule\nnor one justified by its practical success. It simply\nsays that  unnecessary  elements in a symbolism\nmean nothing.\nSigns which serve  one  purpose are logically\nequivalent, signs which serve  no  purpose are\nlogically meaningless.\n5.4733  Frege says: Every legitimately constructed\nproposition must have a sense; and I say: Every\npossible proposition is legitimately constructed,\nand if it has no sense this can only be because\nwe have given no  meaning  to some of its constituent\nparts.\n(Even if we believe that we have done so.)\nThus \"Socrates is identical\" says nothing,\nbecause we have given  no  meaning to the word\n\"identical\" as  adjective . For when it occurs as\nthe sign of equality it symbolizes in an entirely\ndifferent way\u2014the symbolizing relation is another\u2014therefore the symbol is in the two cases entirely\ndifferent; the two symbols have the sign in common with one another only by accident.\n&#32;   &#8203;\n5.474  The number of necessary fundamental operations depends only on our notation.\n5.475  It is only a question of constructing a system\nof signs of a definite number of dimensions\u2014of\na definite mathematical multiplicity.\n5.476  It is clear that we are not concerned here with\na  number of primitive ideas  which must be signified\nbut with the expression of a rule.\n5.5  Every truth-function is a result of the successive\napplication of the operation (- - - - T)(\n&#x03BE;\n{\\displaystyle \\xi }\n, . . . .) to\nelementary propositions.\nThis operation denies all the propositions in\nthe right-hand bracket and I call it the negation\nof these propositions.\n5.501  An expression in brackets whose terms are\npropositions I indicate\u2014if the order of the terms\nin the bracket is indifferent\u2014by a sign of the form\n\"\n(\n&#x03BE;\n&#x00AF;\n)\n{\\displaystyle ({\\bar {\\xi }})}\n\". \"\n&#x03BE;\n{\\displaystyle \\xi }\n\" is a variable whose values are the\nterms of the expression in brackets, and the line\nover the variable indicates that it stands for all\nits values in the bracket.\n(Thus if\n&#x03BE;\n{\\displaystyle \\xi }\nhas the 3 values P, Q, R, then\n(\n&#x03BE;\n&#x00AF;\n)\n{\\displaystyle ({\\bar {\\xi }})}\n=(P,Q, R).)\nThe values of the variables must be determined.\nThe determination is the description of the propositions which the variable stands for.\nHow the description of the terms of the expression in brackets takes place is unessential.\nWe may distinguish 3 kinds of description:\nDirect enumeration. In this case we can place simply its constant values instead of the variable.\nGiving a function \"\nf\nx\n{\\displaystyle fx}\n\" whose values for all values of \"\nx\n{\\displaystyle x}\n\" are the propositions to be described.\nGiving a formal law, according to which those propositions are constructed. In this case the&#32;   &#8203;   terms of the expression in brackets are all the\nterms of a formal series.\n5.502  Therefore I write instead of \"(- - - - T)(\n&#x03BE;\n{\\displaystyle \\xi }\n, . . . .)\", \"\nN\n(\n&#x03BE;\n&#x00AF;\n)\n{\\displaystyle N({\\bar {\\xi }})}\n\".\nN\n(\n&#x03BE;\n&#x00AF;\n)\n{\\displaystyle N({\\bar {\\xi }})}\nis the negation of all the values of the\npropositional variable\n&#x03BE;\n{\\displaystyle \\xi }\n.\n5.503  As it is obviously easy to express how propositions can be constructed by means of this operation\nand how propositions are not to be constructed by\nmeans of it, this must be capable of exact expression.\n5.51  If\n&#x03BE;\n{\\displaystyle \\xi }\nhas only one value, then\nN\n(\n&#x03BE;\n&#x00AF;\n)\n{\\displaystyle N({\\bar {\\xi }})}\n=\n&#x223C;\np\n{\\displaystyle \\sim p}\n(not\np\n{\\displaystyle p}\n),\nif it has two values then\nN\n(\n&#x03BE;\n&#x00AF;\n)\n{\\displaystyle N({\\bar {\\xi }})}\n=\n&#x223C;\np\n.\n&#x223C;\nq\n{\\displaystyle \\sim p.\\sim q}\n(neither\np\n{\\displaystyle p}\nnor\nq\n{\\displaystyle q}\n).\n5.511  How can the all-embracing logic which mirrors\nthe world use such special catches and manipulations? Only because all these are connected into\nan infinitely fine network, to the great mirror.\n5.512  \"\n&#x223C;\np\n{\\displaystyle \\sim p}\n\" is true if \"\np\n{\\displaystyle p}\n\" is false. Therefore in the\ntrue proposition \"\n&#x223C;\np\n{\\displaystyle \\sim p}\n\" \"\np\n{\\displaystyle p}\n\" is a false proposition.\nHow then can the stroke \"\n&#x223C;\n{\\displaystyle \\sim }\n\" bring it into\nagreement with reality?\nThat which denies in \"\n&#x223C;\np\n{\\displaystyle \\sim p}\n\" is however not\n\"\n&#x223C;\n{\\displaystyle \\sim }\n\" but that which all signs of this notation,\nwhich deny\np\n{\\displaystyle p}\n, have in common.\nHence the common rule according to which\n\"\n&#x223C;\np\n{\\displaystyle \\sim p}\n\",  \"\n&#x223C; &#x223C; &#x223C;\np\n{\\displaystyle \\sim \\sim \\sim p}\n\", \"\n&#x223C;\np\n&#x2228;\n&#x223C;\np\n{\\displaystyle \\sim p\\lor \\sim p}\n\", \"\n&#x223C;\np\n.\n&#x223C;\np\n{\\displaystyle \\sim p.\\sim p}\n\",\netc. etc. (to infinity) are constructed. And this\nwhich is common to them all mirrors denial.\n5.513  We could say: What is common to all symbols,\nwhich assert both\np\n{\\displaystyle p}\nand\nq\n{\\displaystyle q}\n, is the proposition\n\"\np\n.\nq\n{\\displaystyle p.q}\n\". What is common to all symbols, which\nassert either\np\n{\\displaystyle p}\nor\nq\n{\\displaystyle q}\n, is the proposition \"\np\n&#x2228;\nq\n{\\displaystyle p\\lor q}\n\".\nAnd similarly we can say: Two propositions\nare opposed to one another when they have\nnothing in common with one another; and every\nproposition has only one negative, because there\nis only one proposition which lies altogether\noutside it.\n&#32;   &#8203;   Thus in Russell's notation also it appears evident\nthat \"\nq\n:\np\n&#x2228;\n&#x223C;\np\n{\\displaystyle q:p\\lor \\sim p}\n\" says the same as \"\nq\n{\\displaystyle q}\n\"; that\n\"\np\n&#x2228;\n&#x223C;\np\n{\\displaystyle p\\lor \\sim p}\n\" says nothing.\n5.514  If a notation is fixed, there is in it a rule according to which all the propositions denying\np\n{\\displaystyle p}\nare\nconstructed, a rule according to which all the\npropositions asserting\np\n{\\displaystyle p}\nare constructed, a rule\naccording to which all the propositions asserting\np\n{\\displaystyle p}\nor\nq\n{\\displaystyle q}\nare constructed, and so on. These rules\nare equivalent to the symbols and in them their\nsense is mirrored.\n5.515  It must be recognized in our symbols that what\nis connected by \"\n&#x2228;\n{\\displaystyle \\lor }\n\", \"\n.\n{\\displaystyle .}\n\", etc., must be propositions.\nAnd this is the case, for the symbols \"\np\n{\\displaystyle p}\n\" and\n\"\nq\n{\\displaystyle q}\n\" presuppose \"\n&#x2228;\n{\\displaystyle \\lor }\n\", \"\n&#xA0;\n{\\displaystyle ~}\n\", etc. If the sign\n\"\np\n{\\displaystyle p}\n\" in \"\np\n&#x2228;\nq\n{\\displaystyle p\\lor q}\n\" does not stand for a complex sign,\nthen by itself it cannot have sense; but then also\nthe signs \"\np\n&#x2228;\np\n{\\displaystyle p\\lor p}\n\", \"\np\n.\np\n{\\displaystyle p.p}\n\" etc. which have the\nsame sense as \"\np\n{\\displaystyle p}\n\" have no sense. If, however,\n\"\np\n&#x2228;\np\n{\\displaystyle p\\lor p}\n\" has no sense, then also \"\np\n&#x2228;\nq\n{\\displaystyle p\\lor q}\n\" can have no sense.\n5.5151  Must the sign of the negative proposition be\nconstructed by means of the sign of the positive?\nWhy should one not be able to express the\nnegative proposition by means of a negative fact?\n(Like: if \"\na\n{\\displaystyle a}\n\" does not stand in a certain relation\nto \"\nb\n{\\displaystyle b}\n\", it could express that \"\na\nR\nb\n{\\displaystyle aRb}\n\" is not the case.)\nBut here also the negative proposition is indirectly constructed with the positive.\nThe positive  proposition  must presuppose the\nexistence of the negative  proposition  and conversely.\n5.52  If the values of\n&#x03BE;\n{\\displaystyle \\xi }\nare the total values of a function\nf\nx\n{\\displaystyle fx}\nfor all values of\nx\n{\\displaystyle x}\n, then\nN\n&#x03BE;\n&#x00AF;\n=&#x223C;\n(\n&#x2203;\nx\n)\n.\nf\nx\n{\\displaystyle N{\\bar {\\xi }}=\\sim (\\exists x).fx}\n.\n5.521  I separate the concept  all  from the truth-function.\nFrege and Russell have introduced generality\nin connexion with the logical product or the logical&#32;   &#8203;   sum. Then it would be difficult to understand\nthe propositions \"\n&#xA0;\n(\n&#x2203;\nx\n)\n.\nf\nx\n{\\displaystyle ~(\\exists x).fx}\n\" and \"\n&#xA0;\n(\nx\n)\n.\nf\nx\n{\\displaystyle ~(x).fx}\n\" in which\nboth ideas lie concealed.\n5.522  That which is peculiar to the \"symbolism of\ngenerality\" is firstly, that it refers to a logical\nprototype, and secondly, that it makes constants\nprominent.\n5.523  The generality symbol occurs as an argument.\n5.524  If the objects are given, therewith are  all  objects also given.\nIf the elementary propositions are given, then\ntherewith  all  elementary propositions are also\ngiven.\n5.525  It is not correct to render the proposition\n\"\n&#xA0;\n(\n&#x2203;\nx\n)\n.\nf\nx\n{\\displaystyle ~(\\exists x).fx}\n\"\u2014as Russell does\u2014in words \" fx  is  possible \".\nCertainty, possibility or impossibility of a state\nof affairs are not expressed by a proposition but\nby the fact that an expression is a tautology, a\nsignificant proposition or a contradiction.\nThat precedent to which one would always\nappeal, must be present in the symbol itself.\n5.526  One can describe the world completely by\ncompletely generalized propositions,  i.e. , without\nfrom the outset co-ordinating any name with a\ndefinite object.\nIn order then to arrive at the customary way\nof expression we need simply say after an expression \"there is one and only one  x , which. . . .\":\nand this  x  is  a ,\n5.5261  A completely generalized proposition is like\nevery other proposition composite. (This is shown\nby the fact that in \"\n&#xA0;\n(\n&#x2203;\nx\n,\n&#x03D5;\n)\n.\n&#x03D5;\nx\n{\\displaystyle ~(\\exists x,\\phi ).\\phi x}\n\" we must mention\n\"\n&#x03D5;\n{\\displaystyle \\phi }\n\" and \"\nx\n{\\displaystyle x}\n\" separately. Both stand independently in signifying relations to the world\nas in the ungeneralized proposition.)\n&#32;   &#8203;   A characteristic of a composite symbol: it has\nsomething: in common with  other  symbols.\n5.5262  The truth or falsehood of  every  proposition alters\nsomething in the general structure of the world.\nAnd the range which is allowed to its structure by\nthe totality of elementary propositions is exactly\nthat which the completely general propositions\ndelimit.\n(If an elementary proposition is true, then, at\nany rate, there is one  more  elementary proposition\ntrue.)\n5.53  Identity of the object I express by identity of\nthe sign and not by means of a sign of identity.\nDifference of the objects by difference of the\nsigns.\n5.5301  That identity is not a relation between objects is\nobvious. This becomes very clear if, for example,\none considers the proposition \"\n(\nx\n)\n:\nf\nx\n&#x2283;\n.\nx\n=\na\n{\\displaystyle (x):fx\\supset .x=a}\n\"\nWhat this proposition says is simply that  only\na\n{\\displaystyle a}\nsatisfies the function\nf\n{\\displaystyle f}\n, and not that only such\nthings satisfy the function\nf\n{\\displaystyle f}\nwhich have a certain\nrelation to\na\n{\\displaystyle a}\n.\nOne could of course say that in fact  only\na\n{\\displaystyle a}\nhas this relation to\na\n{\\displaystyle a}\nbut in order to express\nthis we should need the sign of identity itself.\n.5302  Russell's definition of \"\n=\n{\\displaystyle =}\n\" won't do; because\naccording to it one cannot say that two objects\nhave all their properties in common. (Even if\nthis proposition is never true, it is nevertheless\nsignificant .)\n5.5303  Roughly speaking: to say of  two  things that\nthey are identical is nonsense, and to say of  one\nthing that it is identical with itself is to say\nnothing.\n5.531  I write therefore not \"\nf\n(\na\n,\nb\n)\n.\na\n=\nb\n{\\displaystyle f(a,b).a=b}\n\" but \"\nf\n(\na\n,\na\n)\n{\\displaystyle f(a,a)}\n\"\n(or \"\nf\n(\nb\n,\nb\n)\n{\\displaystyle f(b,b)}\n\"). And not \"\nf\n(\na\n,\nb\n)\n.\n&#x223C;\na\n=\nb\n{\\displaystyle f(a,b).\\sim a=b}\n\" but \"\nf\n(\na\n,\nb\n)\n{\\displaystyle f(a,b)}\n\"\n5.532  And analogously: not \"\n(\n&#x2203;\nx\n,\ny\n)\n.\nf\n(\nx\n,\ny\n)\n.\nx\n=\ny\n{\\displaystyle (\\exists x,y).f(x,y).x=y}\n\",&#32;   &#8203;   but \"\n(\n&#x2203;\nx\n)\n.\nf\n(\nx\n,\nx\n)\n{\\displaystyle (\\exists x).f(x,x)}\n\"; and not \"\n(\n&#x2203;\nx\n,\ny\n)\n.\nf\n(\nx\n,\ny\n)\n.\n&#x223C;\nx\n=\ny\n{\\displaystyle (\\exists x,y).f(x,y).\\sim x=y}\n\"  but \"\n(\n&#x2203;\nx\n,\ny\n)\n.\nf\n(\nx\n,\ny\n)\n{\\displaystyle (\\exists x,y).f(x,y)}\n\".\n(Therefore instead of Russell's \"\n(\n&#x2203;\nx\n,\ny\n)\n.\nf\n(\nx\n,\ny\n)\n{\\displaystyle (\\exists x,y).f(x,y)}\n\": \"\n(\n&#x2203;\nx\n,\ny\n)\n.\nf\n(\nx\n,\ny\n)\n&#x2228;\n(\n&#x2203;\nx\n)\n.\nf\n(\nx\n,\nx\n)\n{\\displaystyle (\\exists x,y).f(x,y)\\lor (\\exists x).f(x,x)}\n\".)\n5.5321  Instead of \"\n(\nx\n)\n.\nf\nx\n&#x2283;\nx\n=\na\n{\\displaystyle (x).fx\\supset x=a}\n\" we therefore write  e.g.  \"\n(\n&#x2203;\nx\n)\n.\nf\nx\n.\n&#x2283;\n.\nf\na\n:&#x223C;\n(\n&#x2203;\nx\n,\ny\n)\n.\nf\nx\n.\nf\ny\n{\\displaystyle (\\exists x).fx.\\supset .fa:\\sim (\\exists x,y).fx.fy}\n\"\nAnd the proposition \" only  one\nx\n{\\displaystyle x}\nsatisfies\nf\n(\n)\n{\\displaystyle f()}\n\"\nreads: \"\n(\n&#x2203;\nx\n)\n.\nf\nx\n:&#x223C;\n(\n&#x2203;\nx\n,\ny\n)\n.\nf\nx\n.\nf\ny\n{\\displaystyle (\\exists x).fx:\\sim (\\exists x,y).fx.fy}\n\".\n5.533  The identity sign is therefore not an essential\nconstituent of logical notation.\n5.534  And we see that apparent propositions like:\n\"\na\n=\na\n{\\displaystyle a=a}\n\", \"\na\n=\nb\n.\nb\n=\nc\n.\n&#x2283;\na\n=\nc\n{\\displaystyle a=b.b=c.\\supset a=c}\n\", \"\n(\nx\n)\n.\nx\n=\nx\n{\\displaystyle (x).x=x}\n\", \"\n(\n&#x2203;\nx\n)\n.\nx\n=\na\n{\\displaystyle (\\exists x).x=a}\n\", etc. cannot be written in a correct logical notation at all.\n5.535  So all problems disappear which are connected with such pseudo-propositions.\nThis is the place to solve all the problems which\narise through Russell's \"Axiom of Infinity\".\nWhat the axiom of infinity is meant to say\nwould be expressed in language by the fact that\nthere is an infinite number of names with different\nmeanings.\n5.5351  There are certain cases in which one is tempted\nto use expressions of the form *\"\na\n=\na\n{\\displaystyle a=a}\n\" or \"\np\n&#x2283;\np\n{\\displaystyle p\\supset p}\n\".\nAs, for instance, when one would speak of the\narchetype Proposition, Thing, etc. So Russell in the\nPrinciples of Mathematics  has rendered the nonsense \" p\nis a proposition\" in symbols by \"\np\n&#x2283;\np\n{\\displaystyle p\\supset p}\n\" and has\nput it as hypothesis before certain propositions to\nshow that their places for arguments could only\nbe occupied by propositions.\n(It is nonsense to place the hypothesis\np\n&#x2283;\np\n{\\displaystyle p\\supset p}\nbefore a proposition in order to ensure that its\narguments have the right form, because the\nhypothesis for a non-proposition as argument\nbecomes not false but meaningless, and because\nthe proposition itself becomes senseless for &#32;   &#8203;   arguments of the wrong kind, and therefore it survives\nthe wrong arguments no better and no worse\nthan the senseless hypothesis attached for this\npurpose.)\n5.5352  Similarly it was proposed to express \"There are\nno things\" by \"\n&#x223C;\n(\n&#x2203;\nx\n)\n.\nx\n=\nx\n{\\displaystyle \\sim (\\exists x).x=x}\n\" But even if this\nwere a proposition\u2014would it not be true if indeed\n\"There were things\", but these were not identical\nwith themselves?\n5.54  In the general propositional form, propositions\noccur in a proposition only as bases of the truth-operations.\n5.541  At first sight it appears as if there were also a\ndifferent way in which one proposition could occur\nin another.\nEspecially in certain propositional forms of\npsychology, like \"A thinks, that\np\n{\\displaystyle p}\nis the case\",\nor \"A thinks\np\n{\\displaystyle p}\n\", etc.\nHere it appears superficially as if the proposition\np\n{\\displaystyle p}\nstood to the object A in a kind of relation.\n(And in modern epistemology (Russell, Moore,\netc.) those propositions have been conceived in\nthis way.)\n5.542  But it is clear that \"A believes that\np\n{\\displaystyle p}\n\", \"A\nthinks\np\n{\\displaystyle p}\n\", \"A says\np\n{\\displaystyle p}\n\", are of the form \"'\np\n{\\displaystyle p}\n' says\np\n{\\displaystyle p}\n\": and here we have no co-ordination of a fact\nand an object, but a co-ordination of facts by\nmeans of a co-ordination of their objects.\n5.5421  This shows that there is no such thing as the\nsoul\u2014the subject, etc.\u2014as it is conceived in contemporary superficial psychology.\nA composite soul would not be a soul any longer.\n5.5422  The correct explanation of the form of the\nproposition \"\np\n{\\displaystyle p}\nA judges\np\n{\\displaystyle p}\n\" must show that it is\nimpossible to judge a nonsense. (Russell's theory\ndoes not satisfy this condition.)\n5.5423  To perceive a complex means to perceive that&#32;   &#8203;   its constituents are combined in such and such a\nway.\nThis perhaps explains that the figure\ncan be seen in two ways as a cube; and all similar\nphenomena. For we really see two different facts.\n(If I fix my eyes first on the corners  a  and only\nglance at  b ,  a  appears in front and  b  behind, and\nvice versa.)\n5.55  We must now answer a priori the question\nas to all possible forms of the elementary propositions.\nThe elementary proposition consists of names.\nSince we cannot give the number of names with\ndifferent meanings, we cannot give the composition\nof the elementary proposition.\n5.551  Our fundamental principle is that every question\nwhich can be decided at all by logic can be decided\noff-hand.\n(And if we get into a situation where we need\nto answer such a problem by looking at the world,\nthis shows that we are on a fundamentally wrong\ntrack.)\n5.552  The \"experience\" which we need to understand logic is not that such and such is the\ncase, but that something  is ; but that is  no  experience.\nLogic  precedes  every experience\u2014that something is  so .\nIt is before the How, not before the What.\n&#32;   &#8203;\n5.5521  And if this were not the case, how could\nwe apply logic? We could say: if there\nwere a logic, even if there were no world,\nhow then could there be a logic, since there is a\nworld?\n5.553  Russell said that there were simple relations\nbetween different numbers of things (individuals).\nBut between what numbers? And how should\nthis be decided\u2014by experience?\n(There is no pre-eminent number.)\n5.554  The enumeration of any special forms would\nbe entirely arbitrary.\n5.5541  How could we decide a priori whether, for\nexample, I can get into a situation in which I need\nto symbolize with a sign of a 27-termed relation?\n5.5542  May we then ask this at all? Can we set out\na sign form and not know whether anything can\ncorrespond to it?\nHas the question sense: what must there  be\nin order that anything can be the case?\n5.555  It is clear that we have a concept of the\nelementary proposition apart from its special\nlogical form.\nWhere, however, we can build symbols\naccording to a system, there this system is the\nlogically important thing and not the single\nsymbols.\nAnd how would it be possible that I should\nhave to deal with forms in logic which I can\ninvent: but I must have to deal with that which\nmakes it possible for me to invent them.\n5.556  There cannot be a hierarchy of the forms of the\nelementary propositions. Only that which we\nourselves construct can we foresee.\n5.5561  Empirical reality is limited by the totality of\nobjects. The boundary appears again in the\ntotality of elementary propositions.&#32;   &#8203;   The hierarchies are and must be independent\nof reality.\n5.5562  If we know on purely logical grounds, that\nthere must be elementary propositions, then this\nmust be known by everyone who understands\npropositions in their unanalysed form.\n5.5563  All propositions of our colloquial language are\nactually, just as they are, logically completely\nin order. That simple thing which we ought to\ngive here is not a model of the truth but the complete\ntruth itself.\n(Our problems are not abstract but perhaps the\nmost concrete that there are.)\n5.557  The  application  of logic decides what elementary\npropositions there are.\nWhat lies in its application logic cannot anticipate.\nIt is clear that logic may not conflict with its\napplication.\nBut logic must have contact with its application.\nTherefore logic and its application may not\noverlap one another.\n5.5571  If I cannot give elementary propositions a\npriori then it must lead to obvious nonsense to\ntry to give them.\n5.6   The limits of my language  mean the limits of my world.\n5.61  Logic fills the world: the limits of the world\nare also its limits.\nWe cannot therefore say in logic: This and\nthis there is in the world, that there is not.\nFor that would apparently presuppose that we\nexclude certain possibilities, and this cannot be\nthe case since otherwise logic must get outside\nthe limits of the world: that is, if it could\nconsider these limits from the other side\nalso.&#32;   &#8203;   What we cannot think, that we cannot think:\nwe cannot therefore  say  what we cannot\nthink.\n5.62  This remark provides a key to the question, to\nwhat extent solipsism is a truth.\nIn fact what solipsism  means , is quite correct,\nonly it cannot be  said , but it shows itself.\nThat the world is  my  world, shows itself in\nthe fact that the limits of the language ( the\nlanguage which I understand) mean the limits of\nmy  world.\n5.621  The world and life are one.\n5.63  I am my world. (The microcosm.)\n5.631  The thinking, presenting subject; there is no\nsuch thing.\nIf I wrote a book \"The world as I found it\",\nI should also have therein to report on my body\nand say which members obey my will and which\ndo not, etc. This then would be a method of\nisolating the subject or rather of showing that in\nan important sense there is no subject: that is to\nsay, of it alone in this book mention could  not  be\nmade.\n5.632  The subject does not belong to the world but\nit is a limit of the world.\n5.633   Where in  the world is a metaphysical subject to\nbe noted?\nYou say that this case is altogether like that of\nthe eye and the field of sight. But you do  not\nreally see the eye.\nAnd from nothing  in the field of sight  can it be\nconcluded that it is seen from an eye.\n5.6331  For the field of sight has not a form like this:\n&#32;   &#8203;\n5.634  This is connected with the fact that no part of our experience is also a priori.\nEverything we see could also be otherwise.\nEverything we can describe at all could also be otherwise.\nThere is no order of things a priori.\n5.64  Here we see that solipsism strictly carried out coincides with pure realism. The I in solipsism shrinks to an extensionless point and there remains the reality co-ordinated with it.\n5.641  There is therefore really a sense in which in philosophy we can talk of a non-psychological I.\nThe I occurs in philosophy through the fact that the \"world is my world\".\nThe philosophical I is not the man, not the human body or the human soul of which psychology treats, but the metaphysical subject, the limit\u2014not a part of the world.\n&#32;\n--- Chapter 6 ---\n6  The general form of truth function is:\n[\np\n&#x00AF;\n,\n&#x03BE;\n&#x00AF;\n,\nN\n(\n&#x03BE;\n&#x00AF;\n)\n]\n{\\displaystyle [{\\bar {p}},{\\bar {\\xi }},N({\\bar {\\xi }})]}\n.\nThis is the general form of proposition.\n6.001  This says nothing else than that every proposition is the result of successive applications of the operation\nN\n(\n&#x03BE;\n&#x00AF;\n)\n{\\displaystyle N({\\bar {\\xi }})}\nto the elementary propositions.\n6.002  If we are given the general form of the way in which a proposition is constructed, then thereby we are also given the general form of the way in which by an operation out of one proposition another can be created.\n6.01  The general form of the operation\n&#x03A9;\n&#x2032;\n(\n&#x03B7;\n&#x00AF;\n)\n{\\displaystyle \\Omega '({\\bar {\\eta }})}\nis therefore:\n[\n&#x03BE;\n&#x00AF;\n,\nN\n(\n&#x03BE;\n&#x00AF;\n)\n]\n&#x2032;\n(\n&#x03B7;\n&#x00AF;\n)\n(\n=\n[\n&#x03B7;\n&#x00AF;\n,\n&#x03BE;\n&#x00AF;\n,\nN\n(\n&#x03BE;\n&#x00AF;\n)\n]\n)\n{\\displaystyle [{\\bar {\\xi }},N({\\bar {\\xi }})]'({\\bar {\\eta }})(=[{\\bar {\\eta }},{\\bar {\\xi }},N({\\bar {\\xi }})])}\n.\nThis is the most general form of transition from one proposition to another.\n&#32;   &#8203;     6.02   And thus we come to numbers: I define\nx =\u03a9 0  &#39;  x  Def. and\n\u03a9'\u03a9 \u03bd  &#39;  x  = \u03a9 \u03bd+1  &#39;  x  Def\nAccording, then, to these symbolic rules we write the series  x , \u03a9 &#39;  x , \u03a9'\u03a9 &#39;  x , \u03a9'\u03a9'\u03a9 &#39;  x\n. . . . .\nas: \u03a9 0  &#39;  x , \u03a9 0+1  &#39;  x , \u03a9 0+1+1  &#39;  x , \u03a9 0+1+1+1  &#39;  x ,\n. . . . .\nTherefore I write in place of \"[ x ,\u03be,\u03a9'\u03be]\",\n\"[\u03a9 0  &#39;  x , \u03a9 \u03bd  &#39;  x , \u03a9 \u03bd+1  &#39;  x ]\".\nAnd I define:\n0 + 1 = 1 Def.\n0 + 1 + 1 = 2 Def.\n0 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 3 Def.\nand so on.\n6.021   A number is the exponent of an operation.\n6.022   The concept number is nothing else than that which is common to all numbers, the general form of number.\nThe concept number is the variable number.\nAnd the concept of equality of numbers is the general form of all special equalities of numbers.\n6.03   The general form of the cardinal number is: [0, \u03be, \u03be+1].\n6.031   The theory of classes is altogether superfluous in mathematics.\nThis is connected with the fact that the generality which we need in mathematics is not the  accidental  one.\n6.1   The propositions of logic are tautologies.\n6.11   The propositions of logic therefore say nothing. (They are the analytical propositions.)\n6.111   Theories which make a proposition of logic appear substantial are always false. One could  e.g.  believe that the words \"true\" and \"false\" signify two properties among other properties, and then it would appear as a remarkable fact&#32;   &#8203;   that every proposition possesses one of these\nproperties. This now by no means appears self-evident, no more so than the proposition \"All\nroses are either yellow or red\" would sound even\nif it were true. Indeed our proposition now gets\nquite the character of a proposition of natural\nscience and this is a certain symptom of its being\nfalsely understood.\n6.112  The correct explanation of logical propositions\nmust give them a peculiar position among all\npropositions.\n6.113  It is the characteristic mark of logical propositions that one can perceive in the symbol alone\nthat they are true; and this fact contains in itself\nthe whole philosophy of logic. And so also it is\none of the most important facts that the truth or\nfalsehood of non-logical propositions can  not  be\nrecognized from the propositions alone.\n6.12  The fact that the propositions of logic are\ntautologies  shows  the formal\u2014logical\u2014properties\nof language, of the world.\nThat its constituent parts connected together  in this way  give a tautology characterizes the logic of\nits constituent parts.\nIn order that propositions connected together\nin a definite way may give a tautology they\nmust have definite properties of structure. That\nthey give a tautology when  so  connected shows\ntherefore that they possess these properties of\nstructure.\n6.1201  That  e.g.  the propositions \" p \" and \"~ p \" in\nthe connexion \"~( p.~p )\" give a tautology\nshows that they contradict one another. That the\npropositions \" p\u2283q \", \" p \" and \" q \" connected\ntogether in the form \" (p\u2283q).(p):\u2283:(q) \" give a\ntautology shows that \" q \" follows from \" p \" and \" p\u2283q \".&#32;   &#8203;   That \"( x ). fx :\u2283: fa \" is a tautology shows that\nfa  follows from ( x ) , fx , etc. etc.\n6.1202  It is clear that we could have used for this\npurpose contradictions instead of tautologies.\n6.1203  In order to recognize a tautology as such, we\ncan, in cases in which no sign of generality occurs\nin the tautology, make use of the following intuitive\nmethod: I write instead of \" p\", \"q\", \"r \", etc.,\n\" TpF\", \"TqF\", \"TrF \", etc. The truth-combinations I express by brackets,  e.g. :\nand the co-ordination of the truth or falsity of the\nwhole proposition with the truth-combinations of\nthe truth-arguments by lines in the following way:\nThis sign, for example, would therefore present the proposition \"p\u2283q\". Now I will proceed\nto inquire whether such a proposition as ~( p. ~p )\n(The Law of Contradiction) is a tautology. The\nform \"~  \u03be \" is written in our notation\n&#32;   &#8203;   the form \" \u03be . \u03b7 \" thus : \u2014\nHence the proposition  ~(p . ~ q)  runs thus:\u2014\nIf here we put \" p \" instead of \" q \" and examine\nthe combination of the outermost T and F with the\ninnermost, it is seen that the truth of the whole\nproposition is co-ordinated with  all  the truth-combinations of its argument, its falsity with none of\nthe truth-combinations.\n6.121  The propositions of logic demonstrate the logical\nproperties of propositions, by combining them into\npropositions which say nothing.\nThis method could be called a zero-method. In\na logical proposition propositions are brought into\nequilibrium with one another, and the state of\nequilibrium then shows how these propositions\nmust be logically constructed.\n6.122  Whence it follows that we can get on without logical propositions, for we can recognize in an adequate notation the formal properties of the propositions by mere inspection.\n&#32;   &#8203;\n6.1221  If for example two propositions \" p \" and \" q \"\ngive a tautology in the connexion \" p\u2283a \", then\nit is clear that \" q \" follows from \" p \".\nE.g. that \" q \" follows from \" p\u2283q.p \" we see from\nthese two propositions themselves, but we can also\nshow it by combining them to \" p\u2283q.p:\u2283:q \" and\nthen showing that this is a tautology.\n6.1222  This throws light on the question why logical\npropositions can no more be empirically confirmed\nthan they can be empirically refuted. Not only\nmust a proposition of logic be incapable of being\ncontradicted by any possible experience, but it\nmust also be incapable of being confirmed by any\nsuch.\n6.1223  It now becomes clear why we often feel as though\n\"logical truths\" must be \" postulated \" by us. We\ncan in fact postulate them in so far as we can\npostulate an adequate notation.\n6.1224  It also becomes clear why logic has been called\nthe theory of forms and of inference.\n6.123  It is clear that the laws of logic cannot themselves obey further logical laws.\n(There is not, as Russell supposed, for every\n\"type\" a special law of contradiction; but one is\nsufficient, since it is not applied to itself.)\n6.1231  The mark of logical propositions is not their\ngeneral validity.\nTo be general is only to be accidentally valid\nfor all things. An ungeneralized proposition can\nbe tautologous just as well as a generalized\none.\n6.1232  Logical general validity, we could call essential as opposed to accidental general validity,  e.g.  of the proposition \"all men are mortal\". Propositions like Russell's \"axiom of reducibility\" are not&#32;   &#8203;   logical propositions, and this explains our feeling\nthat, if true, they can only be true by a happy\nchance.\n6.1233  We can imagine a world in which the axiom of\nreducibility is not valid. But it is clear that logic\nhas nothing to do with the question whether our\nworld is really of this kind or not.\n6.124  The logical propositions describe the scaffolding\nof the world, or rather they present it. They\n\"treat\" of nothing. They presuppose that names\nhave meaning, and that elementary propositions\nhave sense. And this is their connexion with the\nworld. It is clear that it must show something\nabout the world that certain combinations of symbols\u2014which essentially have a definite character\u2014are\ntautologies. Herein lies the decisive point. We said\nthat in the symbols which we use something is arbitrary, something not. In logic only this expresses:\nbut this means that in logic it is not  we  who express,\nby means of signs, what we want, but in logic the\nnature of the essentially necessary signs itself\nasserts. That is to say, if we know the logical\nsyntax of any sign language, then all the propositions of logic are already given.\n6.125  It is possible, also with the old conception of\nlogic, to give at the outset a description of all \"true\"\nlogical propositions.\n6.1251  Hence there can  never  be surprises in logic.\n6.126  Whether a proposition belongs to logic can be\ncalculated by calculating the logical properties of\nthe  symbol .\nAnd this we do when we prove a logical proposition. For without troubling ourselves about a sense and a meaning, we form the logical\npropositions out of others by mere symbolic rules.\n&#32;   &#8203;   We prove a logical proposition by creating it\nout of other logical propositions by applying in\nsuccession certain operations, which again generate\ntautologies out of the first. (And from a tautology\nonly tautologies  follow .)\nNaturally this way of showing that its propositions are tautologies is quite unessential to\nlogic. Because the propositions, from which the\nproof starts, must show without proof that they\nare tautologies.\n6.1261  In logic process and result are equivalent.\n(Therefore no surprises.)\n6.1262  Proof in logic is only a mechanical expedient\nto facilitate the recognition of tautology, where\nit is complicated.\n6.1263  It would be too remarkable, if one could prove\na significant proposition  logically  from another, and\na logical proposition  also . It is clear from the\nbeginning that the logical proof of a significant\nproposition and the proof  in  logic must be two\nquite different things.\n6.1264  The significant proposition asserts something,\nand its proof shows that it is so; in logic every\nproposition is the form of a proof.\nEvery proposition of logic is a modus ponens\npresented in signs. (And the modus ponens can\nnot be expressed by a proposition.)\n6.1265  Logic can always be conceived to be such that\nevery proposition is its own proof.\n6.127  All propositions of logic are of equal rank ;\nthere are not some which are essentially primitive\nand others deduced from these.\nEvery tautology itself shows that it is a tautology.\n6.1271  It is clear that the number of \"primitive propositions of logic\" is arbitrary, for we could deduce&#32;   &#8203;   logic from one primitive proposition by simply\nforming, for example, the logical product of Frege's\nprimitive propositions. (Frege would perhaps say\nthat this would no longer be immediately self-evident. But it is remarkable that so exact a\nthinker as Frege should have appealed to the\ndegree of self-evidence as the criterion of a\nlogical proposition.)\n6.13  Logic is not a theory but a reflexion of the\nworld.\nLogic is transcendental.\n6.2  Mathematics is a logical method.\nThe propositions of mathematics are equations,\nand therefore pseudo-propositions.\n6.21  Mathematical propositions express no thoughts.\n6.211  In life it is never a mathematical proposition\nwhich we need, but we use mathematical propositions  only  in order to infer from propositions\nwhich do not belong to mathematics to others\nwhich equally do not belong to mathematics.\n(In philosophy the question \"Why do we really\nuse that word, that proposition?\" constantly leads\nto valuable results.)\n6.22  The logic of the world which the propositions\nof logic show in tautologies, mathematics shows\nin equations.\n6.23  If two expressions are connected by the sign of\nequality, this means that they can be substituted\nfor one another. But whether this is the case\nmust show itself in the two expressions themselves.\nIt characterizes the logical form of two expressions, that they can be substituted for one another.\n6.231  It is a property of affirmation that it can be\nconceived as double denial.\nIt is a property of \"1 + 1 + 1 + 1\" that it can be conceived as \"(1 + 1) + (1 + 1)\".\n&#32;   &#8203;\n6.232  Frege says that these expressions have the same\nmeaning but different senses.\nBut what is essential about equation is that it\nis not necessary in order to show that both expressions, which are connected by the sign of\nequality, have the same meaning: for this can be\nperceived from the two expressions themselves.\n6.2321  And, that the propositions of mathematics can\nbe proved means nothing else than that their\ncorrectness can be seen without our having to\ncompare what they express with the facts as regards\ncorrectness.\n6.2322  The identity of the meaning of two expressions\ncannot be  asserted . For in order to be able to\nassert anything about their meaning, I must know\ntheir meaning, and if I know their meaning, I\nknow whether they mean the same or something\ndifferent.\n6.2323  The equation characterizes only the standpoint\nfrom which I consider the two expressions, that\nis to say the standpoint of their equality of\nmeaning.\n6.233  To the question whether we need intuition for\nthe solution of mathematical problems it must be\nanswered that language itself here supplies the\nnecessary intuition.\n6.2331  The process of  calculation  brings about just this intuition.\nCalculation is not an experiment.\n6.234  Mathematics is a method of logic.\n6.2341  The essential of mathematical method is working with equations. On this method depends the\nfact that every proposition of mathematics must\nbe self-evident.\n66.24  The method by which mathematics arrives at\nits equations is the method of substitution.\nFor equations express the substitutability of two expressions, and we proceed from a number&#32;   &#8203;   of equations to new equations, replacing expressions by others in accordance with the equations.\n6.241   Thus the proof of the proposition 2x2 = 4 runs:\n(\u03a9  \u03bd  )  \u03bc  &#39;   x =\u03a9  \u03bd\u00d7\u03bc  &#39;   x  Def.\n\u03a9 2\u00d72'  x =(\u03a9 2 ) 2'  x =(\u03a9 2 ) 1+1'  x =\u03a9 2' '\u03a9 2'  x =\u03a9 1+1' \u03a9 1+1'  x\n=(\u03a9'\u03a9)'(\u03a9'\u03a9) &#39;  x =\u03a9'\u03a9'\u03a9'\u03a9 &#39;  x =\u03a9 1+1+1+1\n6.3   Logical research means the investigation of  all regularity . And outside logic all is accident.\n6.31   The so-called law of induction cannot in any case be a logical law, for it is obviously a significant proposition.\u2014And therefore it cannot be a law a priori either.\n6.32   The law of causality is not a law but the form of a law.   &#91; 1 &#93;\n6.321   \"Law of Causality\" is a class name. And as in mechanics there are, for instance, minimum-laws, such as that of least action, so in physics there are causal laws, laws of the causality form.\n6.3211   Men had indeed an idea that there must be  a  \"law of least action\", before they knew exactly how it ran. (Here, as always, the a priori certain proves to be something purely logical.)\n6.33   We do not  believe  a priori in a law of conservation, but we  know  a priori the possibility of a logical form.\n6.34   All propositions, such as the law of causation, the law of continuity in nature, the law of least expenditure in nature, etc. etc., all these are a priori intuitions of possible forms of the propositions of science.\n6.341   Newtonian mechanics, for example, brings the description of the universe to a unified form.&#32;   &#8203;   Let us imagine a white surface with irregular\nblack spots. We now say: Whatever kind of\npicture these make I can always get as near as\nI like to its description, if I cover the surface\nwith a sufficiently fine square network and now\nsay of every square that it is white or black.\nIn this way I shall have brought the description\nof the surface to a unified form. This form is\narbitrary, because I could have applied with equal\nsuccess a net with a triangular or hexagonal\nmesh. It can happen that the description would\nhave been simpler with the aid of a triangular\nmesh; that is to say we might have described\nthe surface more accurately with a triangular,\nand coarser, than with the finer square mesh, or\nvice versa, and so on. To the different networks\ncorrespond different systems of describing the\nworld. Mechanics determine a form of description by saying: All propositions in the description of the world must be obtained in a given\nway from a number of given propositions\u2014the\nmechanical axioms. It thus provides the bricks\nfor building the edifice of science, and says:\nWhatever building thou wouldst erect, thou shalt\nconstruct it in some manner with these bricks\nand these alone.\n(As with the system of numbers one must be\nable to write down any arbitrary number, so\nwith the system of mechanics one must be able\nto write down any arbitrary physical proposition.)\n6.342  And now we see the relative position of logic and mechanics. (We could construct the network out of figures of different kinds, as out of triangles and hexagons together.) That a picture like that instanced above can be described by a network of a given form asserts  nothing  about&#32;   &#8203;   the picture. (For this holds of every picture of\nthis kind.) But  this  does characterize the picture,\nthe fact, namely, that it can be  completely  described by a definite net of  definite  fineness.\nSo too the fact that it can be described by\nNewtonian mechanics asserts nothing about the\nworld; but  this  asserts something, namely, that\nit can be described in that particular way in which\nas a matter of fact it is described. The fact,\ntoo, that it can be described more simply by one\nsystem of mechanics than by another says something about the world.\n6.343  Mechanics is an attempt to construct according\nto a single plan all  true  propositions which we\nneed for the description of the world.\n6.3431  Through their whole logical apparatus the\nphysical laws still speak of the objects of the\nworld.\n6.3432  We must not forget that the description of the\nworld by mechanics is always quite general.\nThere is, for example, never any mention of\nparticular  material points in it, but always only\nof  some points or other .\n6.35  Although the spots in our picture are geometrical figures, geometry can obviously say nothing\nabout their actual form and position. But the\nnetwork is  purely  geometrical, and all its properties can be given a priori.\nLaws, like the law of causation, etc., treat\nof the network and not of what the network\ndescribes.\n6.36  If there were a law of causality, it might run:\n\"There are natural laws\".\nBut that can clearly not be said: it shows itself.\n6.361  In the terminology of Hertz we might say: Only  uniform  connexions are  thinkable .&#32;   &#8203;\n6.3611  We cannot compare any process with the\n\"passage of time\"\u2014there is no such thing\u2014but\nonly with another process (say, with the movement of the chronometer).\nHence the description of the temporal sequence\nof events is only possible if we support ourselves\non another process.\nIt is exactly analogous for space. When, for\nexample, we say that neither of two events (which\nmutually exclude one another) can occur, because\nthere is  no cause  why the one should occur rather\nthan the other, it is really a matter of our being\nunable to describe  one  of the two events unless\nthere is some sort of asymmetry. And if there  is\nsuch an asymmetry, we can regard this as the\ncause  of the occurrence of the one and of the non-occurrence of the other.\n6.36111  The Kantian problem of the right and left hand\nwhich cannot be made to cover one another already\nexists in the plane, and even in one-dimensional\nspace; where the two congruent figures  a  and  b\ncannot be made to cover one another without\nmoving them out of this space. The right and\nleft hand are in fact completely congruent. And\nthe fact that they cannot be made to cover one\nanother has nothing to do with it.\nA right-hand glove could be put on a left hand\nif it could be turned round in four-dimensional\nspace.\n6.362  What can be described can happen too, and\nwhat is excluded by the law of causality cannot be\ndescribed.\n6.363  The process of induction is the process of&#32;   &#8203;   assuming the  simplest  law that can be made to\nharmonize with our experience.\n6.3631  This process, however, has no logical foundation but only a psychological one.\nIt is clear that there are no grounds for believing that the simplest course of events will really\nhappen.\n6.36311  That the sun will rise to-morrow, is an hypothesis; and that means that we do not know whether\nit will rise.\n6.37  A necessity for one thing to happen because\nanother has happened does not exist. There is\nonly  logical  necessity.\n6.371  At the basis of the whole modern view of\nthe world lies the illusion that the so-called\nlaws of nature are the explanations of natural\nphenomena.\n6.372  So people stop short at natural laws as at something unassailable, as did the ancients at God\nand Fate.\nAnd they both are right and wrong. But the\nancients were clearer, in so far as they recognized\none clear terminus, whereas the modern system\nmakes it appear as though  everything  were explained.\n6.373  The world is independent of my will.\n6.374  Even if everything we wished were to happen,\nthis would only be, so to speak, a favour of\nfate, for there is no  logical  connexion between will\nand world, which would guarantee this, and the\nassumed physical connexion itself we could not\nagain will.\n6.375  As there is only a  logical  necessity, so there is only a  logical  impossibility.\n6.3751  For two colours,  e.g.  to be at one place in the visual field, is impossible, logically impossible, for it is excluded by the logical structure of colour.\n&#32;   &#8203;   Let us consider how this contradiction presents\nitself in physics. Somewhat as follows : That a\nparticle cannot at the same time have two velocities,  i.e.  that at the same time it cannot be in\ntwo places,  i.e.  that particles in different places\nat the same time cannot be identical.\n(It is clear that the logical product of two\nelementary propositions can neither be a tautology\nnor a contradiction. The assertion that a point\nin the visual field has two different colours at the\nsame time, is a contradiction.)\n6.4  All propositions are of equal value.\n6.41  The sense of the world must lie outside the\nworld. In the world everything is as it is and\nhappens as it does happen.  In  it there is no value\u2014and if there were, it would be of no value.\nIf there is a value which is of value, it must\nlie outside all happening and being-so. For all\nhappening and being-so is accidental.\nWhat makes it non-accidental cannot lie  in\nthe world, for otherwise this would again be accidental.\nIt must lie outside the world.\n6.42  Hence also there can be no ethical propositions.\nPropositions cannot express anything higher.\n6.421  It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed.\nEthics is transcendental.\n(Ethics and aesthetics are one.)\n6.422  The first thought in setting up an ethical law\nof the form \"thou shalt\u2026\" is: And what if I do not do it? But it is clear that ethics has nothing to do with punishment and reward in the ordinary sense. This question as to the  consequences  of an action must therefore be irrelevant. At least these consequences will not be events. For there must be something right in that formulation of the question. There must be some sort&#32;   &#8203;   of ethical reward and ethical punishment, but this must lie in the action itself.\n(And this is clear also that the reward must be\nsomething acceptable, and the punishment something unacceptable.)\n6.423  Of the will as the subject of the ethical we cannot speak.\nAnd the will as a phenomenon is only of interest to psychology.\n6.43  If good or bad willing changes the world, it\ncan only change the limits of the world, not the\nfacts; not the things that can be expressed in\nlanguage.\nIn brief, the world must thereby become quite\nanother. It must so to speak wax or wane as a\nwhole.\nThe world of the happy is quite another than\nthat of the unhappy.\n6.431  As in death, too, the world does not change, but ceases.\n6.4311  Death is not an event of life. Death is not lived through.\nIf by eternity is understood not endless temporal\nduration but timelessness, then he lives eternally\nwho lives in the present.\nOur life is endless in the way that our visual\nfield is without limit.\n6.4312  The temporal immortality of the human soul, that is to say, its eternal survival after death, is not only in no way guaranteed, but this assumption in the first place will not do for us what we always tried to make it do. Is a riddle solved by the fact that I survive for ever? Is this eternal life not as enigmatic as our present one? The solution of the riddle of life in space and time lies  outside  space and time.\n&#32;   &#8203;   (It is not problems of natural science which have\nto be solved.)\n6.432   How  the world is, is completely indifferent for what is higher. God does not reveal himself in the\nworld.\n6.4321  The facts all belong only to the task and not to its performance.\n6.44  Not  how  the world is, is the mystical, but  that  it is.\n6.45  The contemplation of the world sub specie aeterni\nis its contemplation as a limited whole.\nThe feeling of the world as a limited whole is\nthe mystical feeling.\n6.5  For an answer which cannot be expressed the\nquestion too cannot be expressed.\nThe  riddle  does not exist.\nIf a question can be put at all, then it  can  also be answered.\n6.51  Scepticism is  not  irrefutable, but palpably senseless, if it would doubt where a question cannot be\nasked.\nFor doubt can only exist where there is a\nquestion; a question only where there is an answer,\nand this only where something  can be said .\n6.52  We feel that even if  all possible  scientific\nquestions be answered, the problems of life have\nstill not been touched at all. Of course there is\nthen no question left, and just this is the\nanswer.\n6.521   The solution of the problem of life is seen in the vanishing of this problem.\n(Is not this the reason why men to whom\nafter long doubting the sense of life became\nclear, could not then say wherein this sense\nconsisted?)\n6.522  There is indeed the inexpressible. This  shows  itself; it is the mystical.\n6.53  The right method of philosophy would be this.&#32;   &#8203;   To say nothing except what can be said,  i.e.  the propositions of natural science,  i.e.  something that has nothing to do with philosophy: and then always, when someone else wished to say something metaphysical, to demonstrate to him that he had given no meaning to certain signs in his propositions. This method would be unsatisfying to the other\u2014he would not have the feeling that we were teaching him philosophy\u2014but it would be the only strictly correct method.\n6.54  My propositions are elucidatory in this way: he who understands me finally recognizes them as senseless, when he has climbed out through them, on them, over them. (He must so to speak throw away the ladder, after he has climbed up on it.)\nHe must surmount these propositions; then he sees the world rightly.\n\u2191     I.e.  not the form of one particular law, but of any law of a certain sort (B. R.).\n&#32;\n--- Chapter 7 ---\n7  Whereof one cannot speak, thereof one must be silent.\n&#32;", "source": "tractatus.txt"}
