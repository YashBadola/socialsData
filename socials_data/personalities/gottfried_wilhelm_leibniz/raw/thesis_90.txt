90. Finally, under this perfect government, there will be no good
   action unrewarded and no evil action unpunished; everything must turn
   out for the well-being of the good; that is to say, of those who are
   not disaffected in this great state, who, after having done their duty,
   trust in Providence and who love and imitate, as is meet, the Author of
   all Good, delighting in the contemplation of his perfections according
   to the nature of that genuine, pure love which finds pleasure in the
   happiness of those who are loved. It is for this reason that wise and
   virtuous persons work in behalf of everything which seems conformable
   to presumptive or antecedent will of God, and are, nevertheless,
   content with what God actually brings to pass through his secret,
   consequent and determining will, recognising that if we were able to
   understand sufficiently well the order of the universe, we should find
   that it surpasses all the desires of the wisest of us, and that it is
   impossible to render it better than it is, not only for all in general,
   but also for each one of us in particular, provided that we have the
   proper attachment for the author of all, not only as the Architect and
   the efficient cause of our being, but also as our Lord and the Final
   Cause, who ought to be the whole goal of our will, and who alone can
   make us happy.
