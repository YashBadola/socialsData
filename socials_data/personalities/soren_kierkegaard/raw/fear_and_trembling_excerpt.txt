Title: Fear and Trembling
Author: Søren Kierkegaard (Johannes de Silentio)

Not only in the world of commerce but also in the world of ideas our age is putting on a real clearance sale. Everything can be had so dirt cheap that one begins to wonder whether in the end anyone will want to make a bid. Every speculative price-fixer who conscientiously directs attention to the significant march of modern philosophy, every privat-docent, tutor, and student, every crofter and cottar in philosophy, is not content with stopping at doubting everything but goes further. Perhaps it would be untimely and ill-timed to ask them where they are going, but surely it is courteous and unobtrusive to regard it as certain that they have doubted everything, since otherwise it would be queer of them to be going further.

Faith is precisely this paradox, that the single individual is higher than the universal. If this is not faith, then Abraham is lost, then faith has never existed in the world... because it has always existed. For if the ethical (i.e., the moral) is the highest thing, and if nothing incommensurable remains in man in any other way but as the evil (i.e., the particular which has to be expressed in the universal), then one needs no other categories than those which the Greek philosophers possessed or which can be deduced from them by logic. But the merit of faith is that it is the paradox, that the single individual is higher than the universal.

The Knight of Faith is the only happy man, the heir to the finite, while the Knight of Resignation is a stranger and a foreigner. He knows the bliss of the infinite, the pain of renouncing everything, the dearest thing in the world, and yet finding peace in the pain. But the Knight of Faith does exactly the same, renounces everything infinitely, and then takes everything back by virtue of the absurd.
