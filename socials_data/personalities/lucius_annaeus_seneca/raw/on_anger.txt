We shall now examine whether anger is in accordance with nature, and whether it is useful and ought to be retained in some measure.

I say that anger is not in accordance with nature. For if we look at man, is there anything gentler? If we look at anger, is there anything more savage? Man is born for mutual help; anger for mutual destruction. The one seeks to form unions; the other to separate. The one seeks to do good; the other to do harm. The one helps even strangers; the other attacks even its dearest friends. The one is ready even to sacrifice itself for the good of others; the other to plunge into peril provided it drags another down. Who, then, is more ignorant of the nature of things than he who ascribes this savage and pernicious vice to nature’s best and most finished work?

"But," you say, "anger is useful, because it makes men more ready to fight." I answer that drunkenness also makes men more ready to fight, and so does frenzy, and so does fear; for fear often makes men bold when they are driven into a corner. But anger is never useful, not even in war; for it is not the angry man who fights best, but the man who is cool and collected, who knows what he is doing, and who does not allow his passion to obscure his judgment.
