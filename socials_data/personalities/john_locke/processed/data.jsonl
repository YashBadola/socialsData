These, which remain, I hope are sufficient to\nestablish the throne of our great restorer, our present King William; to\nmake good his title, in the consent of the people, which being the only\none of all lawful governments, he has more fully and clearly, than any\nprince in Christendom; and to justify to the world the people of\nEngland, whose love of their just and natural rights, with their\nresolution to preserve them, saved the nation when it was on the very\nbrink of slavery and ruin. If these papers have that evidence, I flatter\nmyself is to be found in them, there will be no great miss of those\nwhich are lost, and my reader may be satisfied without them: for I\nimagine, I shall have neither the time, nor inclination to repeat my\npains, and fill up the wanting part of my answer, by tracing Sir Robert\nagain, through all the windings and obscurities, which are to be met\nwith in the several branches of his wonderful system. The king, and body\nof the nation, have since so thoroughly confuted his Hypothesis, that I\nsuppose no body hereafter will have either the confidence to appear\nagainst our common safety, and be again an advocate for slavery; or the\nweakness to be deceived with contradictions dressed up in a popular\nstile, and well-turned periods: for if any one will be at the pains,\nhimself, in those parts, which are here untouched, to strip Sir Robert\u2019s\ndiscourses of the flourish of doubtful expressions, and endeavour to\nreduce his words to direct, positive, intelligible propositions, and\nthen compare them one with another, he will quickly be satisfied, there\nwas never so much glib nonsense put together in well-sounding English.\nIf he think it not worth while to examine his works all thro\u2019, let him\nmake an experiment in that part, where he treats of usurpation; and let\nhim try, whether he can, with all his skill, make Sir Robert\nintelligible, and consistent with himself, or common sense. I should not\nspeak so plainly of a gentleman, long since past answering, had not the\npulpit, of late years, publicly owned his doctrine, and made it the\ncurrent divinity of the times. It is necessary those men, who taking on\nthem to be teachers, have so dangerously misled others, should be openly\nshewed of what authority this their Patriarch is, whom they have so\nblindly followed, that so they may either retract what upon so ill\ngrounds they have vented, and cannot be maintained; or else justify\nthose principles which they preached up for gospel; though they had no\nbetter an author than an English courtier: for I should not have writ\nagainst Sir Robert, or taken the pains to shew his mistakes,\ninconsistencies, and want of (what he so much boasts of, and pretends\nwholly to build on) scripture-proofs, were there not men amongst us,\nwho, by crying up his books, and espousing his doctrine, save me from\nthe reproach of writing against a dead adversary. They have been so\nzealous in this point, that, if I have done him any wrong, I cannot hope\nthey should spare me. I wish, where they have done the truth and the\npublic wrong, they would be as ready to redress it, and allow its just\nweight to this reflection, viz. that there cannot be done a greater\nmischief to prince and people, than the propagating wrong notions\nconcerning government; that so at last all times might not have reason\nto complain of the Drum Ecclesiastic. If any one, concerned really for\ntruth, undertake the confutation of my Hypothesis, I promise him either\nto recant my mistake, upon fair conviction; or to answer his\ndifficulties. But he must remember two things.\nFirst, That cavilling here and there, at some expression, or little\nincident of my discourse, is not an answer to my book.\nSecondly, That I shall not take railing for arguments, nor think either\nof these worth my notice, though I shall always look on myself as bound\nto give satisfaction to any one, who shall appear to be conscientiously\nscrupulous in the point, and shall shew any just grounds for his\nscruples.\nI have nothing more, but to advertise the reader, that Observations\nstands for Observations on Hobbs, Milton, &c. and that a bare quotation\nof pages always means pages of his Patriarcha, Edition 1680.\nBook II\nCHAPTER. I.\nAN ESSAY CONCERNING THE TRUE ORIGINAL, EXTENT AND END OF CIVIL\nGOVERNMENT\nSect. 1. It having been shewn in the foregoing discourse,\n(<i>1</i>). That Adam had not, either by natural right of fatherhood, or by\npositive donation from God, any such authority over his children, or\ndominion over the world, as is pretended:\n(<i>2</i>). That if he had, his heirs, yet, had no right to it:\n(<i>3</i>). That if his heirs had, there being no law of nature nor positive\nlaw of God that determines which is the right heir in all cases that may\narise, the right of succession, and consequently of bearing rule, could\nnot have been certainly determined:\n(<i>4</i>). That if even that had been determined, yet the knowledge of which\nis the eldest line of Adam\u2019s posterity, being so long since utterly\nlost, that in the races of mankind and families of the world, there\nremains not to one above another, the least pretence to be the eldest\nhouse, and to have the right of inheritance:\nAll these premises having, as I think, been clearly made out, it is\nimpossible that the rulers now on earth should make any benefit, or\nderive any the least shadow of authority from that, which is held to be\nthe fountain of all power, Adam\u2019s private dominion and paternal\njurisdiction; so that he that will not give just occasion to think that\nall government in the world is the product only of force and violence,\nand that men live together by no other rules but that of beasts, where\nthe strongest carries it, and so lay a foundation for perpetual disorder\nand mischief, tumult, sedition and rebellion, (things that the followers\nof that hypothesis so loudly cry out against) must of necessity find out\nanother rise of government, another original of political power, and\nanother way of designing and knowing the persons that have it, than what\nSir Robert Filmer hath taught us.\nSect. 2. To this purpose, I think it may not be amiss, to set down what\nI take to be political power; that the power of a MAGISTRATE over a\nsubject may be distinguished from that of a FATHER over his children, a\nMASTER over his servant, a HUSBAND over his wife, and a LORD over his\nslave. All which distinct powers happening sometimes together in the\nsame man, if he be considered under these different relations, it may\nhelp us to distinguish these powers one from wealth, a father of a\nfamily, and a captain of a galley.\nSect. 3. POLITICAL POWER, then, I take to be a RIGHT of making laws with\npenalties of death, and consequently all less penalties, for the\nregulating and preserving of property, and of employing the force of the\ncommunity, in the execution of such laws, and in the defence of the\ncommonwealth from foreign injury; and all this only for the public\ngood.\nCHAPTER. II.\nOF THE STATE OF NATURE.\nSect. 4. TO understand political power right, and derive it from its\noriginal, we must consider, what state all men are naturally in, and\nthat is, a state of perfect freedom to order their actions, and dispose\nof their possessions and persons, as they think fit, within the bounds\nof the law of nature, without asking leave, or depending upon the will\nof any other man.\nA state also of equality, wherein all the power and jurisdiction is\nreciprocal, no one having more than another; there being nothing more\nevident, than that creatures of the same species and rank, promiscuously\nborn to all the same advantages of nature, and the use of the same\nfaculties, should also be equal one amongst another without\nsubordination or subjection, unless the lord and master of them all\nshould, by any manifest declaration of his will, set one above another,\nand confer on him, by an evident and clear appointment, an undoubted\nright to dominion and sovereignty.\nSect. 5. This equality of men by nature, the judicious Hooker looks upon\nas so evident in itself, and beyond all question, that he makes it the\nfoundation of that obligation to mutual love amongst men, on which he\nbuilds the duties they owe one another, and from whence he derives the\ngreat maxims of justice and charity. His words are,\n/#\nThe like natural inducement hath brought men to know that it is no\nless their duty, to love others than themselves; for seeing those\nthings which are equal, must needs all have one measure; if I\ncannot but wish to receive good, even as much at every man\u2019s hands,\nas any man can wish unto his own soul, how should I look to have\nany part of my desire herein satisfied, unless myself be careful to\nsatisfy the like desire, which is undoubtedly in other men, being\nof one and the same nature? To have any thing offered them\nrepugnant to this desire, must needs in all respects grieve them as\nmuch as me; so that if I do harm, I must look to suffer, there\nbeing no reason that others should shew greater measure of love to\nme, than they have by me shewed unto them: my desire therefore to\nbe loved of my equals in nature as much as possible may be,\nimposeth upon me a natural duty of bearing to them-ward fully the\nlike affection; from which relation of equality between ourselves\nand them that are as ourselves, what several rules and canons\nnatural reason hath drawn, for direction of life, no man is\nignorant, Eccl. Pol. Lib. 1.\n#/\nSect. 6. But though this be a state of liberty, yet it is not a state of\nlicence: though man in that state have an uncontroulable liberty to\ndispose of his person or possessions, yet he has not liberty to destroy\nhimself, or so much as any creature in his possession, but where some\nnobler use than its bare preservation calls for it. The state of nature\nhas a law of nature to govern it, which obliges every one: and reason,\nwhich is that law, teaches all mankind, who will but consult it, that\nbeing all equal and independent, no one ought to harm another in his\nlife, health, liberty, or possessions: for men being all the workmanship\nof one omnipotent, and infinitely wise maker; all the servants of one\nsovereign master, sent into the world by his order, and about his\nbusiness; they are his property, whose workmanship they are, made to\nlast during his, not one another\u2019s pleasure: and being furnished with\nlike faculties, sharing all in one community of nature, there cannot be\nsupposed any such subordination among us, that may authorize us to\ndestroy one another, as if we were made for one another\u2019s uses, as the\ninferior ranks of creatures are for our\u2019s. Every one, as he is bound to\npreserve himself, and not to quit his station wilfully, so by the like\nreason, when his own preservation comes not in competition, ought he, as\nmuch as he can, to preserve the rest of mankind, and may not, unless it\nbe to do justice on an offender, take away, or impair the life, or what\ntends to the preservation of the life, the liberty, health, limb, or\ngoods of another.\nSect. 7. And that all men may be restrained from invading others rights,\nand from doing hurt to one another, and the law of nature be observed,\nwhich willeth the peace and preservation of all mankind, the execution\nof the law of nature is, in that state, put into every man\u2019s hands,\nwhereby every one has a right to punish the transgressors of that law to\nsuch a degree, as may hinder its violation: for the law of nature would,\nas all other laws that concern men in this world be in vain, if there\nwere no body that in the state of nature had a power to execute that\nlaw, and thereby preserve the innocent and restrain offenders. And if\nany one in the state of nature may punish another for any evil he has\ndone, every one may do so: for in that state of perfect equality, where\nnaturally there is no superiority or jurisdiction of one over another,\nwhat any may do in prosecution of that law, every one must needs have a\nright to do.\nSect. 8. And thus, in the state of nature, one man comes by a power over\nanother; but yet no absolute or arbitrary power, to use a criminal, when\nhe has got him in his hands, according to the passionate heats, or\nboundless extravagancy of his own will; but only to retribute to him, so\nfar as calm reason and conscience dictate, what is proportionate to his\ntransgression, which is so much as may serve for reparation and\nrestraint: for these two are the only reasons, why one man may lawfully\ndo harm to another, which is that we call punishment. In transgressing\nthe law of nature, the offender declares himself to live by another rule\nthan that of reason and common equity, which is that measure God has set\nto the actions of men, for their mutual security; and so he becomes\ndangerous to mankind, the tye, which is to secure them from injury and\nviolence, being slighted and broken by him. Which being a trespass\nagainst the whole species, and the peace and safety of it, provided for\nby the law of nature, every man upon this score, by the right he hath to\npreserve mankind in general, may restrain, or where it is necessary,\ndestroy things noxious to them, and so may bring such evil on any one,\nwho hath transgressed that law, as may make him repent the doing of it,\nand thereby deter him, and by his example others, from doing the like\nmischief. And in the case, and upon this ground, EVERY MAN HATH A RIGHT\nTO PUNISH THE OFFENDER, AND BE EXECUTIONER OF THE LAW OF NATURE.\nSect. 9. I doubt not but this will seem a very strange doctrine to some\nmen: but before they condemn it, I desire them to resolve me, by what\nright any prince or state can put to death, or punish an alien, for any\ncrime he commits in their country. It is certain their laws, by virtue\nof any sanction they receive from the promulgated will of the\nlegislative, reach not a stranger: they speak not to him, nor, if they\ndid, is he bound to hearken to them. The legislative authority, by which\nthey are in force over the subjects of that commonwealth, hath no power\nover him. Those who have the supreme power of making laws in England,\nFrance or Holland, are to an Indian, but like the rest of the world, men\nwithout authority: and therefore, if by the law of nature every man hath\nnot a power to punish offences against it, as he soberly judges the case\nto require, I see not how the magistrates of any community can punish an\nalien of another country; since, in reference to him, they can have no\nmore power than what every man naturally may have over another.\nSect, 10. Besides the crime which consists in violating the law, and\nvarying from the right rule of reason, whereby a man so far becomes\ndegenerate, and declares himself to quit the principles of human nature,\nand to be a noxious creature, there is commonly injury done to some\nperson or other, and some other man receives damage by his\ntransgression: in which case he who hath received any damage, has,\nbesides the right of punishment common to him with other men, a\nparticular right to seek reparation from him that has done it: and any\nother person, who finds it just, may also join with him that is injured,\nand assist him in recovering from the offender so much as may make\nsatisfaction for the harm he has suffered.\nSect. 11. From these two distinct rights, the one of punishing the crime\nfor restraint, and preventing the like offence, which right of punishing\nis in every body; the other of taking reparation, which belongs only to\nthe injured party, comes it to pass that the magistrate, who by being\nmagistrate hath the common right of punishing put into his hands, can\noften, where the public good demands not the execution of the law, remit\nthe punishment of criminal offences by his own authority, but yet cannot\nremit the satisfaction due to any private man for the damage he has\nreceived. That, he who has suffered the damage has a right to demand in\nhis own name, and he alone can remit: the damnified person has this\npower of appropriating to himself the goods or service of the offender,\nby right of self-preservation, as every man has a power to punish the\ncrime, to prevent its being committed again, by the right he has of\npreserving all mankind, and doing all reasonable things he can in order\nto that end: and thus it is, that every man, in the state of nature, has\na power to kill a murderer, both to deter others from doing the like\ninjury, which no reparation can compensate, by the example of the\npunishment that attends it from every body, and also to secure men from\nthe attempts of a criminal, who having renounced reason, the common rule\nand measure God hath given to mankind, hath, by the unjust violence and\nslaughter he hath committed upon one, declared war against all mankind,\nand therefore may be destroyed as a lion or a tyger, one of those wild\nsavage beasts, with whom men can have no society nor security: and upon\nthis is grounded that great law of nature, Whoso sheddeth man\u2019s blood,\nby man shall his blood be shed. And Cain was so fully convinced, that\nevery one had a right to destroy such a criminal, that after the murder\nof his brother, he cries out, Every one that findeth me, shall slay me;\nso plain was it writ in the hearts of all mankind.\nSect. 12. By the same reason may a man in the state of nature punish the\nlesser breaches of that law. It will perhaps be demanded, with death? I\nanswer, each transgression may be punished to that degree, and with so\nmuch severity, as will suffice to make it an ill bargain to the\noffender, give him cause to repent, and terrify others from doing the\nlike. Every offence, that can be committed in the state of nature, may\nin the state of nature be also punished equally, and as far forth as it\nmay, in a commonwealth: for though it would be besides my present\npurpose, to enter here into the particulars of the law of nature, or its\nmeasures of punishment; yet, it is certain there is such a law, and that\ntoo, as intelligible and plain to a rational creature, and a studier of\nthat law, as the positive laws of commonwealths; nay, possibly plainer;\nas much as reason is easier to be understood, than the fancies and\nintricate contrivances of men, following contrary and hidden interests\nput into words; for so truly are a great part of the municipal laws of\ncountries, which are only so far right, as they are founded on the law\nof nature, by which they are to be regulated and interpreted.\nSect. 13. To this strange doctrine, viz. That in the state of nature\nevery one has the executive power of the law of nature, I doubt not but\nit will be objected, that it is unreasonable for men to be judges in\ntheir own cases, that self-love will make men partial to themselves and\ntheir friends: and on the other side, that ill nature, passion and\nrevenge will carry them too far in punishing others; and hence nothing\nbut confusion and disorder will follow, and that therefore God hath\ncertainly appointed government to restrain the partiality and violence\nof men. I easily grant, that civil government is the proper remedy for\nthe inconveniencies of the state of nature, which must certainly be\ngreat, where men may be judges in their own case, since it is easy to be\nimagined, that he who was so unjust as to do his brother an injury, will\nscarce be so just as to condemn himself for it: but I shall desire those\nwho make this objection, to remember, that absolute monarchs are but\nmen; and if government is to be the remedy of those evils, which\nnecessarily follow from men\u2019s being judges in their own cases, and the\nstate of nature is therefore not to be endured, I desire to know what\nkind of government that is, and how much better it is than the state\nof nature, where one man, commanding a multitude, has the liberty to be\njudge in his own case, and may do to all his subjects whatever he\npleases, without the least liberty to any one to question or controul\nthose who execute his pleasure? and in whatsoever he doth, whether led\nby reason, mistake or passion, must be submitted to? much better it is\nin the state of nature, wherein men are not bound to submit to the\nunjust will of another: and if he that judges, judges amiss in his own,\nor any other case, he is answerable for it to the rest of mankind.\nSect. 14. It is often asked as a mighty objection, where are, or ever\nwere there any men in such a state of nature? To which it may suffice as\nan answer at present, that since all princes and rulers of independent\ngovernments all through the world, are in a state of nature, it is plain\nthe world never was, nor ever will be, without numbers of men in that\nstate. I have named all governors of independent communities, whether\nthey are, or are not, in league with others: for it is not every compact\nthat puts an end to the state of nature between men, but only this one\nof agreeing together mutually to enter into one community, and make one\nbody politic; other promises, and compacts, men may make one with\nanother, and yet still be in the state of nature. The promises and\nbargains for truck, &c. between the two men in the desert island,\nmentioned by Garcilasso de la Vega, in his history of Peru; or between a\nSwiss and an Indian, in the woods of America, are binding to them,\nthough they are perfectly in a state of nature, in reference to one\nanother: for truth and keeping of faith belongs to men, as men, and not\nas members of society.\nSect. 15. To those that say, there were never any men in the state of\nnature, I will not only oppose the authority of the judicious Hooker,\nEccl. Pol. lib. i. sect. 10, where he says,\n/#\nThe laws which have been hitherto mentioned, i.e. the laws of\nnature, do bind men absolutely, even as they are men, although they\nhave never any settled fellowship, never any solemn agreement\namongst themselves what to do, or not to do: but forasmuch as we\nare not by ourselves sufficient to furnish ourselves with competent\nstore of things, needful for such a life as our nature doth desire,\na life fit for the dignity of man; therefore to supply those\ndefects and imperfections which are in us, as living single and\nsolely by ourselves, we are naturally induced to seek communion and\nfellowship with others: this was the cause of men\u2019s uniting\nthemselves at first in politic societies.\n#/\nBut I moreover affirm, that all men are naturally in that state, and\nremain so, till by their own consents they make themselves members of\nsome politic society; and I doubt not in the sequel of this discourse,\nto make it very clear.\nCHAPTER. III.\nOF THE STATE OF WAR.\nSect. 16. THE state of war is a state of enmity and destruction: and\ntherefore declaring by word or action, not a passionate and hasty, but a\nsedate settled design upon another man\u2019s life, puts him in a state of\nwar with him against whom he has declared such an intention, and so has\nexposed his life to the other\u2019s power to be taken away by him, or any\none that joins with him in his defence, and espouses his quarrel; it\nbeing reasonable and just, I should have a right to destroy that which\nthreatens me with destruction: for, by the fundamental law of nature,\nman being to be preserved as much as possible, when all cannot be\npreserved, the safety of the innocent is to be preferred: and one may\ndestroy a man who makes war upon him, or has discovered an enmity to his\nbeing, for the same reason that he may kill a wolf or a lion; because\nsuch men are not under the ties of the commonlaw of reason, have no\nother rule, but that of force and violence, and so may be treated as\nbeasts of prey, those dangerous and noxious creatures, that will be sure\nto destroy him whenever he falls into their power.\nSect. 17. And hence it is, that he who attempts to get another man into\nhis absolute power, does thereby put himself into a state of war with\nhim; it being to be understood as a declaration of a design upon his\nlife: for I have reason to conclude, that he who would get me into his\npower without my consent, would use me as he pleased when he had got me\nthere, and destroy me too when he had a fancy to it; for no body can\ndesire to have me in his absolute power, unless it be to compel me by\nforce to that which is against the right of my freedom, i.e. make me a\nslave. To be free from such force is the only security of my\npreservation; and reason bids me look on him, as an enemy to my\npreservation, who would take away that freedom which is the fence to it;\nso that he who makes an attempt to enslave me, thereby puts himself into\na state of war with me. He that, in the state of nature, would take away\nthe freedom that belongs to any one in that state, must necessarily be\nsupposed to have a design to take away every thing else, that freedom\nbeing the foundation of all the rest; as he that, in the state of\nsociety, would take away the freedom belonging to those of that society\nor commonwealth, must be supposed to design to take away from them every\nthing else, and so be looked on as in a state of war.\nSect. 18. This makes it lawful for a man to kill a thief, who has not in\nthe least hurt him, nor declared any design upon his life, any farther\nthan, by the use of force, so to get him in his power, as to take away\nhis money, or what he pleases, from him; because using force, where he\nhas no right, to get me into his power, let his pretence be what it\nwill, I have no reason to suppose, that he, who would take away my\nliberty, would not, when he had me in his power, take away every thing\nelse. And therefore it is lawful for me to treat him as one who has put\nhimself into a state of war with me, i.e. kill him if I can; for to that\nhazard does he justly expose himself, whoever introduces a state of war,\nand is aggressor in it.\nSect. 19. And here we have the plain difference between the state of\nnature and the state of war, which however some men have confounded, are\nas far distant, as a state of peace, good will, mutual assistance and\npreservation, and a state of enmity, malice, violence and mutual\ndestruction, are one from another. Men living together according to\nreason, without a common superior on earth, with authority to judge\nbetween them, is properly the state of nature. But force, or a declared\ndesign of force, upon the person of another, where there is no common\nsuperior on earth to appeal to for relief, is the state of war: and it\nis the want of such an appeal gives a man the right of war even against\nan aggressor, tho\u2019 he be in society and a fellow subject. Thus a thief,\nwhom I cannot harm, but by appeal to the law, for having stolen all that\nI am worth, I may kill, when he sets on me to rob me but of my horse or\ncoat; because the law, which was made for my preservation, where it\ncannot interpose to secure my life from present force, which, if lost,\nis capable of no reparation, permits me my own defence, and the right of\nwar, a liberty to kill the aggressor, because the aggressor allows not\ntime to appeal to our common judge, nor the decision of the law, for\nremedy in a case where the mischief may be irreparable. Want of a common\njudge with authority, puts all men in a state of nature: force without\nright, upon a man\u2019s person, makes a state of war, both where there is,\nand is not, a common judge.\nSect. 20. But when the actual force is over, the state of war ceases\nbetween those that are in society, and are equally on both sides\nsubjected to the fair determination of the law; because then there lies\nopen the remedy of appeal for the past injury, and to prevent future\nharm: but where no such appeal is, as in the state of nature, for want\nof positive laws, and judges with authority to appeal to, the state of\nwar once begun, continues, with a right to the innocent party to destroy\nthe other whenever he can, until the aggressor offers peace, and desires\nreconciliation on such terms as may repair any wrongs he has already\ndone, and secure the innocent for the future; nay, where an appeal to\nthe law, and constituted judges, lies open, but the remedy is denied by\na manifest perverting of justice, and a barefaced wresting of the laws\nto protect or indemnify the violence or injuries of some men, or party\nof men, there it is hard to imagine any thing but a state of war: for\nwherever violence is used, and injury done, though by hands appointed to\nadminister justice, it is still violence and injury, however coloured\nwith the name, pretences, or forms of law, the end whereof being to\nprotect and redress the innocent, by an unbiassed application of it, to\nall who are under it; wherever that is not bona fide done, war is made\nupon the sufferers, who having no appeal on earth to right them, they\nare left to the only remedy in such cases, an appeal to heaven.\nSect. 21. To avoid this state of war (wherein there is no appeal but to\nheaven, and wherein every the least difference is apt to end, where\nthere is no authority to decide between the contenders) is one great\nreason of men\u2019s putting themselves into society, and quitting the state\nof nature: for where there is an authority, a power on earth, from which\nrelief can be had by appeal, there the continuance of the state of war\nis excluded, and the controversy is decided by that power. Had there\nbeen any such court, any superior jurisdiction on earth, to determine\nthe right between Jephtha and the Ammonites, they had never come to a\nstate of war: but we see he was forced to appeal to heaven. The Lord the\nJudge (says he) be judge this day between the children of Israel and the\nchildren of Ammon, Judg. xi. 27. and then prosecuting, and relying on\nhis appeal, he leads out his army to battle: and therefore in such\ncontroversies, where the question is put, who shall be judge? It cannot\nbe meant, who shall decide the controversy; every one knows what Jephtha\nhere tells us, that the Lord the Judge shall judge. Where there is no\njudge on earth, the appeal lies to God in heaven. That question then\ncannot mean, who shall judge, whether another hath put himself in a\nstate of war with me, and whether I may, as Jephtha did, appeal to\nheaven in it? of that I myself can only be judge in my own conscience,\nas I will answer it, at the great day, to the supreme judge of all men.\nCHAPTER. IV.\nOF SLAVERY.\nSect. 22. THE natural liberty of man is to be free from any superior\npower on earth, and not to be under the will or legislative authority of\nman, but to have only the law of nature for his rule. The liberty of\nman, in society, is to be under no other legislative power, but that\nestablished, by consent, in the commonwealth; nor under the dominion of\nany will, or restraint of any law, but what that legislative shall\nenact, according to the trust put in it. Freedom then is not what Sir\nRobert Filmer tells us, Observations, A. 55. a liberty for every one to\ndo what he lists, to live as he pleases, and not to be tied by any laws:\nbut freedom of men under government is, to have a standing rule to live\nby, common to every one of that society, and made by the legislative\npower erected in it; a liberty to follow my own will in all things,\nwhere the rule prescribes not; and not to be subject to the inconstant,\nuncertain, unknown, arbitrary will of another man: as freedom of nature\nis, to be under no other restraint but the law of nature.\nSect. 23. This freedom from absolute, arbitrary power, is so necessary\nto, and closely joined with a man\u2019s preservation, that he cannot part\nwith it, but by what forfeits his preservation and life together: for a\nman, not having the power of his own life, cannot, by compact, or his\nown consent, enslave himself to any one, nor put himself under the\nabsolute, arbitrary power of another, to take away his life, when he\npleases. No body can give more power than he has himself; and he that\ncannot take away his own life, cannot give another power over it.\nIndeed, having by his fault forfeited his own life, by some act that\ndeserves death; he, to whom he has forfeited it, may (when he has him in\nhis power) delay to take it, and make use of him to his own service, and\nhe does him no injury by it: for, whenever he finds the hardship of his\nslavery outweigh the value of his life, it is in his power, by resisting\nthe will of his master, to draw on himself the death he desires.\nSect. 24. This is the perfect condition of slavery, which is nothing\nelse, but the state of war continued, between a lawful conqueror and a\ncaptive: for, if once compact enter between them, and make an agreement\nfor a limited power on the one side, and obedience on the other, the\nstate of war and slavery ceases, as long as the compact endures: for, as\nhas been said, no man can, by agreement, pass over to another that which\nhe hath not in himself, a power over his own life.\nI confess, we find among the Jews, as well as other nations, that men\ndid sell themselves; but, it is plain, this was only to drudgery, not to\nslavery: for, it is evident, the person sold was not under an absolute,\narbitrary, despotical power: for the master could not have power to kill\nhim, at any time, whom, at a certain time, he was obliged to let go free\nout of his service; and the master of such a servant was so far from\nhaving an arbitrary power over his life, that he could not, at pleasure,\nso much as maim him, but the loss of an eye, or tooth, set him free,\nExod. xxi.\nCHAPTER. V.\nOF PROPERTY.\nSect. 25. Whether we consider natural reason, which tells us, that men,\nbeing once born, have a right to their preservation, and consequently to\nmeat and drink, and such other things as nature affords for their\nsubsistence: or revelation, which gives us an account of those grants\nGod made of the world to Adam, and to Noah, and his sons, it is very\nclear, that God, as king David says, Psal. cxv. 16. has given the earth\nto the children of men; given it to mankind in common. But this being\nsupposed, it seems to some a very great difficulty, how any one should\never come to have a property in any thing: I will not content myself to\nanswer, that if it be difficult to make out property, upon a supposition\nthat God gave the world to Adam, and his posterity in common, it is\nimpossible that any man, but one universal monarch, should have any\nproperty upon a supposition, that God gave the world to Adam, and his\nheirs in succession, exclusive of all the rest of his posterity. But I\nshall endeavour to shew, how men might come to have a property in\nseveral parts of that which God gave to mankind in common, and that\nwithout any express compact of all the commoners.\nSect. 26. God, who hath given the world to men in common, hath also\ngiven them reason to make use of it to the best advantage of life, and\nconvenience. The earth, and all that is therein, is given to men for the\nsupport and comfort of their being. And tho\u2019 all the fruits it naturally\nproduces, and beasts it feeds, belong to mankind in common, as they are\nproduced by the spontaneous hand of nature; and no body has originally a\nprivate dominion, exclusive of the rest of mankind, in any of them, as\nthey are thus in their natural state: yet being given for the use of\nmen, there must of necessity be a means to appropriate them some way or\nother, before they can be of any use, or at all beneficial to any\nparticular man. The fruit, or venison, which nourishes the wild Indian,\nwho knows no enclosure, and is still a tenant in common, must be his,\nand so his, i.e. a part of him, that another can no longer have any\nright to it, before it can do him any good for the support of his life.\nSect. 27. Though the earth, and all inferior creatures, be common to all\nmen, yet every man has a property in his own person: this no body has\nany right to but himself. The labour of his body, and the work of his\nhands, we may say, are properly his. Whatsoever then he removes out of\nthe state that nature hath provided, and left it in, he hath mixed his\nlabour with, and joined to it something that is his own, and thereby\nmakes it his property. It being by him removed from the common state\nnature hath placed it in, it hath by this labour something annexed to\nit, that excludes the common right of other men: for this labour being\nthe unquestionable property of the labourer, no man but he can have a\nright to what that is once joined to, at least where there is enough,\nand as good, left in common for others.\nSect. 28. He that is nourished by the acorns he picked up under an oak,\nor the apples he gathered from the trees in the wood, has certainly\nappropriated them to himself. No body can deny but the nourishment is\nhis. I ask then, when did they begin to be his? when he digested? or\nwhen he eat? or when he boiled? or when he brought them home? or when he\npicked them up? and it is plain, if the first gathering made them not\nhis, nothing else could. That labour put a distinction between them and\ncommon: that added something to them more than nature, the common mother\nof all, had done; and so they became his private right. And will any one\nsay, he had no right to those acorns or apples, he thus appropriated,\nbecause he had not the consent of all mankind to make them his? Was it a\nrobbery thus to assume to himself what belonged to all in common? If\nsuch a consent as that was necessary, man had starved, notwithstanding\nthe plenty God had given him. We see in commons, which remain so by\ncompact, that it is the taking any part of what is common, and removing\nit out of the state nature leaves it in, which begins the property;\nwithout which the common is of no use. And the taking of this or that\npart, does not depend on the express consent of all the commoners. Thus\nthe grass my horse has bit; the turfs my servant has cut; and the ore I\nhave digged in any place, where I have a right to them in common with\nothers, become my property, without the assignation or consent of any\nbody. The labour that was mine, removing them out of that common state\nthey were in, hath fixed my property in them.\nSect. 29. By making an explicit consent of every commoner, necessary to\nany one\u2019s appropriating to himself any part of what is given in common,\nchildren or servants could not cut the meat, which their father or\nmaster had provided for them in common, without assigning to every one\nhis peculiar part. Though the water running in the fountain be every\none\u2019s, yet who can doubt, but that in the pitcher is his only who drew\nit out? His labour hath taken it out of the hands of nature, where it\nwas common, and belonged equally to all her children, and hath thereby\nappropriated it to himself.\nSect. 30. Thus this law of reason makes the deer that Indian\u2019s who hath\nkilled it; it is allowed to be his goods, who hath bestowed his labour\nupon it, though before it was the common right of every one. And amongst\nthose who are counted the civilized part of mankind, who have made and\nmultiplied positive laws to determine property, this original law of\nnature, for the beginning of property, in what was before common, still\ntakes place; and by virtue thereof, what fish any one catches in the\nocean, that great and still remaining common of mankind; or what\nambergrise any one takes up here, is by the labour that removes it out\nof that common state nature left it in, made his property, who takes\nthat pains about it. And even amongst us, the hare that any one is\nhunting, is thought his who pursues her during the chase: for being a\nbeast that is still looked upon as common, and no man\u2019s private\npossession; whoever has employed so much labour about any of that kind,\nas to find and pursue her, has thereby removed her from the state of\nnature, wherein she was common, and hath begun a property.\nSect. 31. It will perhaps be objected to this, that if gathering the\nacorns, or other fruits of the earth, &c. makes a right to them, then\nany one may ingross as much as he will. To which I answer, Not so. The\nsame law of nature, that does by this means give us property, does also\nbound that property too. God has given us all things richly, 1 Tim. vi.\n12. is the voice of reason confirmed by inspiration. But how far has he\ngiven it us? To enjoy. As much as any one can make use of to any\nadvantage of life before it spoils, so much he may by his labour fix a\nproperty in: whatever is beyond this, is more than his share, and\nbelongs to others. Nothing was made by God for man to spoil or destroy.\nAnd thus, considering the plenty of natural provisions there was a long\ntime in the world, and the few spenders; and to how small a part of that\nprovision the industry of one man could extend itself, and ingross it to\nthe prejudice of others; especially keeping within the bounds, set by\nreason, of what might serve for his use; there could be then little room\nfor quarrels or contentions about property so established.\nSect. 32. But the chief matter of property being now not the fruits of\nthe earth, and the beasts that subsist on it, but the earth itself; as\nthat which takes in and carries with it all the rest; I think it is\nplain, that property in that too is acquired as the former. As much land\nas a man tills, plants, improves, cultivates, and can use the product\nof, so much is his property. He by his labour does, as it were, inclose\nit from the common. Nor will it invalidate his right, to say every body\nelse has an equal title to it; and therefore he cannot appropriate, he\ncannot inclose, without the consent of all his fellow-commoners, all\nmankind. God, when he gave the world in common to all mankind, commanded\nman also to labour, and the penury of his condition required it of him.\nGod and his reason commanded him to subdue the earth, i.e. improve it\nfor the benefit of life, and therein lay out something upon it that was\nhis own, his labour. He that in obedience to this command of God,\nsubdued, tilled and sowed any part of it, thereby annexed to it\nsomething that was his property, which another had no title to, nor\ncould without injury take from him.\nSect. 33. Nor was this appropriation of any parcel of land, by improving\nit, any prejudice to any other man, since there was still enough, and as\ngood left; and more than the yet unprovided could use. So that, in\neffect, there was never the less left for others because of his\nenclosure for himself: for he that leaves as much as another can make\nuse of, does as good as take nothing at all. No body could think himself\ninjured by the drinking of another man, though he took a good draught,\nwho had a whole river of the same water left him to quench his thirst:\nand the case of land and water, where there is enough of both, is\nperfectly the same.\nSect. 34. God gave the world to men in common; but since he gave it them\nfor their benefit, and the greatest conveniencies of life they were\ncapable to draw from it, it cannot be supposed he meant it should always\nremain common and uncultivated. He gave it to the use of the industrious\nand rational, (and labour was to be his title to it;) not to the fancy\nor covetousness of the quarrelsome and contentious. He that had as good\nleft for his improvement, as was already taken up, needed not complain,\nought not to meddle with what was already improved by another\u2019s labour:\nif he did, it is plain he desired the benefit of another\u2019s pains, which\nhe had no right to, and not the ground which God had given him in common\nwith others to labour on, and whereof there was as good left, as that\nalready possessed, and more than he knew what to do with, or his\nindustry could reach to.\nSect. 35. It is true, in land that is common in England, or any other\ncountry, where there is plenty of people under government, who have\nmoney and commerce, no one can inclose or appropriate any part, without\nthe consent of all his fellow-commoners; because this is left common by\ncompact, i.e. by the law of the land, which is not to be violated. And\nthough it be common, in respect of some men, it is not so to all\nmankind; but is the joint property of this country, or this parish.\nBesides, the remainder, after such enclosure, would not be as good to\nthe rest of the commoners, as the whole was when they could all make use\nof the whole; whereas in the beginning and first peopling of the great\ncommon of the world, it was quite otherwise. The law man was under, was\nrather for appropriating. God commanded, and his wants forced him to\nlabour. That was his property which could not be taken from him\nwhere-ever he had fixed it. And hence subduing or cultivating the earth,\nand having dominion, we see are joined together. The one gave title to\nthe other. So that God, by commanding to subdue, gave authority so far\nto appropriate: and the condition of human life, which requires labour\nand materials to work on, necessarily introduces private possessions.\nSect. 36. The measure of property nature has well set by the extent of\nmen\u2019s labour and the conveniencies of life: no man\u2019s labour could\nsubdue, or appropriate all; nor could his enjoyment consume more than a\nsmall part; so that it was impossible for any man, this way, to intrench\nupon the right of another, or acquire to himself a property, to the\nprejudice of his neighbour, who would still have room for as good, and\nas large a possession (after the other had taken out his) as before it\nwas appropriated. This measure did confine every man\u2019s possession to a\nvery moderate proportion, and such as he might appropriate to himself,\nwithout injury to any body, in the first ages of the world, when men\nwere more in danger to be lost, by wandering from their company, in the\nthen vast wilderness of the earth, than to be straitened for want of\nroom to plant in. And the same measure may be allowed still without\nprejudice to any body, as full as the world seems: for supposing a man,\nor family, in the state they were at first peopling of the world by the\nchildren of Adam, or Noah; let him plant in some inland, vacant places\nof America, we shall find that the possessions he could make himself,\nupon the measures we have given, would not be very large, nor, even to\nthis day, prejudice the rest of mankind, or give them reason to\ncomplain, or think themselves injured by this man\u2019s incroachment, though\nthe race of men have now spread themselves to all the corners of the\nworld, and do infinitely exceed the small number was at the beginning.\nNay, the extent of ground is of so little value, without labour, that I\nhave heard it affirmed, that in Spain itself a man may be permitted to\nplough, sow and reap, without being disturbed, upon land he has no other\ntitle to, but only his making use of it. But, on the contrary, the\ninhabitants think themselves beholden to him, who, by his industry on\nneglected, and consequently waste land, has increased the stock of corn,\nwhich they wanted. But be this as it will, which I lay no stress on;\nthis I dare boldly affirm, that the same rule of propriety, (viz.) that\nevery man should have as much as he could make use of, would hold still\nin the world, without straitening any body; since there is land enough\nin the world to suffice double the inhabitants, had not the invention of\nmoney, and the tacit agreement of men to put a value on it, introduced\n(by consent) larger possessions, and a right to them; which, how it has\ndone, I shall by and by shew more at large.\nSect. 37. This is certain, that in the beginning, before the desire of\nhaving more than man needed had altered the intrinsic value of things,\nwhich depends only on their usefulness to the life of man; or had\nagreed, that a little piece of yellow metal, which would keep without\nwasting or decay, should be worth a great piece of flesh, or a whole\nheap of corn; though men had a right to appropriate, by their labour,\neach one of himself, as much of the things of nature, as he could use:\nyet this could not be much, nor to the prejudice of others, where the\nsame plenty was still left to those who would use the same industry. To\nwhich let me add, that he who appropriates land to himself by his\nlabour, does not lessen, but increase the common stock of mankind: for\nthe provisions serving to the support of human life, produced by one\nacre of inclosed and cultivated land, are (to speak much within compass)\nten times more than those which are yielded by an acre of land of an\nequal richness lying waste in common. And therefore he that incloses\nland, and has a greater plenty of the conveniencies of life from ten\nacres, than he could have from an hundred left to nature, may truly be\nsaid to give ninety acres to mankind: for his labour now supplies him\nwith provisions out of ten acres, which were but the product of an\nhundred lying in common. I have here rated the improved land very low,\nin making its product but as ten to one, when it is much nearer an\nhundred to one: for I ask, whether in the wild woods and uncultivated\nwaste of America, left to nature, without any improvement, tillage or\nhusbandry, a thousand acres yield the needy and wretched inhabitants as\nmany conveniencies of life, as ten acres of equally fertile land do in\nDevonshire, where they are well cultivated?\nBefore the appropriation of land, he who gathered as much of the wild\nfruit, killed, caught, or tamed, as many of the beasts, as he could; he\nthat so imployed his pains about any of the spontaneous products of\nnature, as any way to alter them from the state which nature put them\nin, by placing any of his labour on them, did thereby acquire a\npropriety in them: but if they perished, in his possession, without\ntheir due use; if the fruits rotted, or the venison putrified, before he\ncould spend it, he offended against the common law of nature, and was\nliable to be punished; he invaded his neighbour\u2019s share, for he had no\nright, farther than his use called for any of them, and they might serve\nto afford him conveniencies of life.\nSect. 38. The same measures governed the possession of land too:\nwhatsoever he tilled and reaped, laid up and made use of, before it\nspoiled, that was his peculiar right; whatsoever he enclosed, and could\nfeed, and make use of, the cattle and product was also his. But if\neither the grass of his enclosure rotted on the ground, or the fruit of\nhis planting perished without gathering, and laying up, this part of the\nearth, notwithstanding his enclosure, was still to be looked on as\nwaste, and might be the possession of any other. Thus, at the beginning,\nCain might take as much ground as he could till, and make it his own\nland, and yet leave enough to Abel\u2019s sheep to feed on; a few acres would\nserve for both their possessions. But as families increased, and\nindustry inlarged their stocks, their possessions inlarged with the need\nof them; but yet it was commonly without any fixed property in the\nground they made use of, till they incorporated, settled themselves\ntogether, and built cities; and then, by consent, they came in time, to\nset out the bounds of their distinct territories, and agree on limits\nbetween them and their neighbours; and by laws within themselves,\nsettled the properties of those of the same society: for we see, that in\nthat part of the world which was first inhabited, and therefore like to\nbe best peopled, even as low down as Abraham\u2019s time, they wandered with\ntheir flocks, and their herds, which was their substance, freely up and\ndown; and this Abraham did, in a country where he was a stranger. Whence\nit is plain, that at least a great part of the land lay in common; that\nthe inhabitants valued it not, nor claimed property in any more than\nthey made use of. But when there was not room enough in the same place,\nfor their herds to feed together, they by consent, as Abraham and Lot\ndid, Gen. xiii. 5. separated and inlarged their pasture, where it best\nliked them. And for the same reason Esau went from his father, and his\nbrother, and planted in mount Seir, Gen. xxxvi. 6.\nSect. 39. And thus, without supposing any private dominion, and property\nin Adam, over all the world, exclusive of all other men, which can no\nway be proved, nor any one\u2019s property be made out from it; but supposing\nthe world given, as it was, to the children of men in common, we see how\nlabour could make men distinct titles to several parcels of it, for\ntheir private uses; wherein there could be no doubt of right, no room\nfor quarrel.\nSect. 40. Nor is it so strange, as perhaps before consideration it may\nappear, that the property of labour should be able to over-balance the\ncommunity of land: for it is labour indeed that puts the difference of\nvalue on every thing; and let any one consider what the difference is\nbetween an acre of land planted with tobacco or sugar, sown with wheat\nor barley, and an acre of the same land lying in common, without any\nhusbandry upon it, and he will find, that the improvement of labour\nmakes the far greater part of the value. I think it will be but a very\nmodest computation to say, that of the products of the earth useful to\nthe life of man nine tenths are the effects of labour: nay, if we will\nrightly estimate things as they come to our use, and cast up the several\nexpences about them, what in them is purely owing to nature, and what to\nlabour, we shall find, that in most of them ninety-nine hundredths are\nwholly to be put on the account of labour.\nSect. 41. There cannot be a clearer demonstration of any thing, than\nseveral nations of the Americans are of this, who are rich in land, and\npoor in all the comforts of life; whom nature having furnished as\nliberally as any other people, with the materials of plenty, i.e. a\nfruitful soil, apt to produce in abundance, what might serve for food,\nraiment, and delight; yet for want of improving it by labour, have not\none hundredth part of the conveniencies we enjoy: and a king of a large\nand fruitful territory there, feeds, lodges, and is clad worse than a\nday-labourer in England.\nSect. 42. To make this a little clearer, let us but trace some of the\nordinary provisions of life, through their several progresses, before\nthey come to our use, and see how much they receive of their value from\nhuman industry. Bread, wine and cloth, are things of daily use, and\ngreat plenty; yet notwithstanding, acorns, water and leaves, or skins,\nmust be our bread, drink and cloathing, did not labour furnish us with\nthese more useful commodities: for whatever bread is more worth than\nacorns, wine than water, and cloth or silk, than leaves, skins or moss,\nthat is wholly owing to labour and industry; the one of these being the\nfood and raiment which unassisted nature furnishes us with; the other,\nprovisions which our industry and pains prepare for us, which how much\nthey exceed the other in value, when any one hath computed, he will then\nsee how much labour makes the far greatest part of the value of things\nwe enjoy in this world: and the ground which produces the materials, is\nscarce to be reckoned in, as any, or at most, but a very small part of\nit; so little, that even amongst us, land that is left wholly to nature,\nthat hath no improvement of pasturage, tillage, or planting, is called,\nas indeed it is, waste; and we shall find the benefit of it amount to\nlittle more than nothing.\nThis shews how much numbers of men are to be preferred to largeness of\ndominions; and that the increase of lands, and the right employing of\nthem, is the great art of government: and that prince, who shall be so\nwise and godlike, as by established laws of liberty to secure protection\nand encouragement to the honest industry of mankind, against the\noppression of power and narrowness of party, will quickly be too hard\nfor his neighbours: but this by the by.\nTo return to the argument in hand.\nSect. 43. An acre of land, that bears here twenty bushels of wheat, and\nanother in America, which, with the same husbandry, would do the like,\nare, without doubt, of the same natural intrinsic value: but yet the\nbenefit mankind receives from the one in a year, is worth 5l. and from\nthe other possibly not worth a penny, if all the profit an Indian\nreceived from it were to be valued, and sold here; at least, I may truly\nsay, not one thousandth. It is labour then which puts the greatest part\nof value upon land, without which it would scarcely be worth any thing:\nit is to that we owe the greatest part of all its useful products; for\nall that the straw, bran, bread, of that acre of wheat, is more worth\nthan the product of an acre of as good land, which lies waste, is all\nthe effect of labour: for it is not barely the plough-man\u2019s pains, the\nreaper\u2019s and thresher\u2019s toil, and the baker\u2019s sweat, is to be counted\ninto the bread we eat; the labour of those who broke the oxen, who\ndigged and wrought the iron and stones, who felled and framed the timber\nemployed about the plough, mill, oven, or any other utensils, which are\na vast number, requisite to this corn, from its being feed to be sown to\nits being made bread, must all be charged on the account of labour, and\nreceived as an effect of that: nature and the earth furnished only the\nalmost worthless materials, as in themselves. It would be a strange\ncatalogue of things, that industry provided and made use of, about every\nloaf of bread, before it came to our use, if we could trace them; iron,\nwood, leather, bark, timber, stone, bricks, coals, lime, cloth, dying\ndrugs, pitch, tar, masts, ropes, and all the materials made use of in\nthe ship, that brought any of the commodities made use of by any of the\nworkmen, to any part of the work; all which it would be almost\nimpossible, at least too long, to reckon up.\nSect. 44. From all which it is evident, that though the things of nature\nare given in common, yet man, by being master of himself, and proprietor\nof his own person, and the actions or labour of it, had still in himself\nthe great foundation of property; and that, which made up the great part\nof what he applied to the support or comfort of his being, when\ninvention and arts had improved the conveniencies of life, was perfectly\nhis own, and did not belong in common to others.\nSect. 45. Thus labour, in the beginning, gave a right of property,\nwherever any one was pleased to employ it upon what was common, which\nremained a long while the far greater part, and is yet more than mankind\nmakes use of. Men, at first, for the most part, contented themselves\nwith what unassisted nature offered to their necessities: and though\nafterwards, in some parts of the world, (where the increase of people\nand stock, with the use of money, had made land scarce, and so of some\nvalue) the several communities settled the bounds of their distinct\nterritories, and by laws within themselves regulated the properties of\nthe private men of their society, and so, by compact and agreement,\nsettled the property which labour and industry began; and the leagues\nthat have been made between several states and kingdoms, either expresly\nor tacitly disowning all claim and right to the land in the others\npossession, have, by common consent, given up their pretences to their\nnatural common right, which originally they had to those countries, and\nso have, by positive agreement, settled a property amongst themselves,\nin distinct parts and parcels of the earth; yet there are still great\ntracts of ground to be found, which (the inhabitants thereof not having\njoined with the rest of mankind, in the consent of the use of their\ncommon money) lie waste, and are more than the people who dwell on it\ndo, or can make use of, and so still lie in common; tho\u2019 this can scarce\nhappen amongst that part of mankind that have consented to the use of\nmoney.\nSect. 46. The greatest part of things really useful to the life of man,\nand such as the necessity of subsisting made the first commoners of the\nworld look after, as it doth the Americans now, are generally things of\nshort duration; such as, if they are not consumed by use, will decay and\nperish of themselves: gold, silver and diamonds, are things that fancy\nor agreement hath put the value on, more than real use, and the\nnecessary support of life. Now of those good things which nature hath\nprovided in common, every one had a right (as hath been said) to as much\nas he could use, and property in all that he could effect with his\nlabour; all that his industry could extend to, to alter from the state\nnature had put it in, was his. He that gathered a hundred bushels of\nacorns or apples, had thereby a property in them, they were his goods as\nsoon as gathered. He was only to look, that he used them before they\nspoiled, else he took more than his share, and robbed others. And indeed\nit was a foolish thing, as well as dishonest, to hoard up more than he\ncould make use of. If he gave away a part to any body else, so that it\nperished not uselesly in his possession, these he also made use of. And\nif he also bartered away plums, that would have rotted in a week, for\nnuts that would last good for his eating a whole year, he did no injury;\nhe wasted not the common stock; destroyed no part of the portion of\ngoods that belonged to others, so long as nothing perished uselesly in\nhis hands. Again, if he would give his nuts for a piece of metal,\npleased with its colour; or exchange his sheep for shells, or wool for a\nsparkling pebble or a diamond, and keep those by him all his life he\ninvaded not the right of others, he might heap up as much of these\ndurable things as he pleased; the exceeding of the bounds of his just\nproperty not lying in the largeness of his possession, but the perishing\nof any thing uselesly in it.\nSect. 47. And thus came in the use of money, some lasting thing that men\nmight keep without spoiling, and that by mutual consent men would take\nin exchange for the truly useful, but perishable supports of life.\nSect. 48. And as different degrees of industry were apt to give men\npossessions in different proportions, so this invention of money gave\nthem the opportunity to continue and enlarge them: for supposing an\nisland, separate from all possible commerce with the rest of the world,\nwherein there were but an hundred families, but there were sheep, horses\nand cows, with other useful animals, wholsome fruits, and land enough\nfor corn for a hundred thousand times as many, but nothing in the\nisland, either because of its commonness, or perishableness, fit to\nsupply the place of money; what reason could any one have there to\nenlarge his possessions beyond the use of his family, and a plentiful\nsupply to its consumption, either in what their own industry produced,\nor they could barter for like perishable, useful commodities, with\nothers? Where there is not some thing, both lasting and scarce, and so\nvaluable to be hoarded up, there men will not be apt to enlarge their\npossessions of land, were it never so rich, never so free for them to\ntake: for I ask, what would a man value ten thousand, or an hundred\nthousand acres of excellent land, ready cultivated, and well stocked too\nwith cattle, in the middle of the inland parts of America, where he had\nno hopes of commerce with other parts of the world, to draw money to him\nby the sale of the product? It would not be worth the enclosing, and we\nshould see him give up again to the wild common of nature, whatever was\nmore than would supply the conveniencies of life to be had there for him\nand his family.\nSect. 49. Thus in the beginning all the world was America, and more so\nthan that is now; for no such thing as money was any where known. Find\nout something that hath the use and value of money amongst his\nneighbours, you shall see the same man will begin presently to enlarge\nhis possessions.\nSect. 50. But since gold and silver, being little useful to the life of\nman in proportion to food, raiment, and carriage, has its value only\nfrom the consent of men, whereof labour yet makes, in great part, the\nmeasure, it is plain, that men have agreed to a disproportionate and\nunequal possession of the earth, they having, by a tacit and voluntary\nconsent, found out, a way how a man may fairly possess more land than he\nhimself can use the product of, by receiving in exchange for the\noverplus gold and silver, which may be hoarded up without injury to any\none; these metals not spoiling or decaying in the hands of the\npossessor. This partage of things in an inequality of private\npossessions, men have made practicable out of the bounds of society, and\nwithout compact, only by putting a value on gold and silver, and tacitly\nagreeing in the use of money: for in governments, the laws regulate the\nright of property, and the possession of land is determined by positive\nconstitutions.\nSect. 51. And thus, I think, it is very easy to conceive, without any\ndifficulty, how labour could at first begin a title of property in the\ncommon things of nature, and how the spending it upon our uses bounded\nit. So that there could then be no reason of quarrelling about title,\nnor any doubt about the largeness of possession it gave. Right and\nconveniency went together; for as a man had a right to all he could\nemploy his labour upon, so he had no temptation to labour for more than\nhe could make use of. This left no room for controversy about the title,\nnor for encroachment on the right of others; what portion a man carved\nto himself, was easily seen; and it was useless, as well as dishonest,\nto carve himself too much, or take more than he needed.\nCHAPTER. VI.\nOF PATERNAL POWER.\nSect. 52. IT may perhaps be censured as an impertinent criticism, in a\ndiscourse of this nature, to find fault with words and names, that have\nobtained in the world: and yet possibly it may not be amiss to offer new\nones, when the old are apt to lead men into mistakes, as this of\npaternal power probably has done, which seems so to place the power of\nparents over their children wholly in the father, as if the mother had\nno share in it; whereas, if we consult reason or revelation, we shall\nfind, she hath an equal title. This may give one reason to ask, whether\nthis might not be more properly called parental power? for whatever\nobligation nature and the right of generation lays on children, it must\ncertainly bind them equal to both the concurrent causes of it. And\naccordingly we see the positive law of God every where joins them\ntogether, without distinction, when it commands the obedience of\nchildren, Honour thy father and thy mother, Exod. xx. 12. Whosoever\ncurseth his father or his mother, Lev. xx. 9. Ye shall fear every man\nhis mother and his father, Lev. xix. 3. Children, obey your parents, &c.\nEph. vi. 1. is the stile of the Old and New Testament.\nSect. 53. Had but this one thing been well considered, without looking\nany deeper into the matter, it might perhaps have kept men from running\ninto those gross mistakes, they have made, about this power of parents;\nwhich, however it might, without any great harshness, bear the name of\nabsolute dominion, and regal authority, when under the title of paternal\npower it seemed appropriated to the father, would yet have founded but\noddly, and in the very name shewn the absurdity, if this supposed\nabsolute power over children had been called parental; and thereby have\ndiscovered, that it belonged to the mother too: for it will but very ill\nserve the turn of those men, who contend so much for the absolute power\nand authority of the fatherhood, as they call it, that the mother should\nhave any share in it; and it would have but ill supported the monarchy\nthey contend for, when by the very name it appeared, that that\nfundamental authority, from whence they would derive their government of\na single person only, was not placed in one, but two persons jointly.\nBut to let this of names pass.\nSect. 54. Though I have said above, Chap. II. That all men by nature are\nequal, I cannot be supposed to understand all sorts of equality: age or\nvirtue may give men a just precedency: excellency of parts and merit may\nplace others above the common level: birth may subject some, and\nalliance or benefits others, to pay an observance to those to whom\nnature, gratitude, or other respects, may have made it due: and yet all\nthis consists with the equality, which all men are in, in respect of\njurisdiction or dominion one over another; which was the equality I\nthere spoke of, as proper to the business in hand, being that equal\nright, that every man hath, to his natural freedom, without being\nsubjected to the will or authority of any other man.\nSect. 55. Children, I confess, are not born in this full state of\nequality, though they are born to it. Their parents have a sort of rule\nand jurisdiction over them, when they come into the world, and for some\ntime after; but it is but a temporary one. The bonds of this subjection\nare like the swaddling clothes they are wrapt up in, and supported by,\nin the weakness of their infancy: age and reason as they grow up, loosen\nthem, till at length they drop quite off, and leave a man at his own\nfree disposal.\nSect. 56. Adam was created a perfect man, his body and mind in full\npossession of their strength and reason, and so was capable, from the\nfirst instant of his being to provide for his own support and\npreservation, and govern his actions according to the dictates of the\nlaw of reason which God had implanted in him. From him the world is\npeopled with his descendants, who are all born infants, weak and\nhelpless, without knowledge or understanding: but to supply the defects\nof this imperfect state, till the improvement of growth and age hath\nremoved them, Adam and Eve, and after them all parents were, by the law\nof nature, under an obligation to preserve, nourish, and educate the\nchildren they had begotten; not as their own workmanship, but the\nworkmanship of their own maker, the Almighty, to whom they were to be\naccountable for them.\nSect. 57. The law, that was to govern Adam, was the same that was to\ngovern all his posterity, the law of reason. But his offspring having\nanother way of entrance into the world, different from him, by a natural\nbirth, that produced them ignorant and without the use of reason, they\nwere not presently under that law; for no body can be under a law, which\nis not promulgated to him; and this law being promulgated or made known\nby reason only, he that is not come to the use of his reason, cannot be\nsaid to be under this law; and Adam\u2019s children, being not presently as\nsoon as born under this law of reason, were not presently free: for law,\nin its true notion, is not so much the limitation as the direction of a\nfree and intelligent agent to his proper interest, and prescribes no\nfarther than is for the general good of those under that law: could they\nbe happier without it, the law, as an useless thing, would of itself\nvanish; and that ill deserves the name of confinement which hedges us in\nonly from bogs and precipices. So that, however it may be mistaken, the\nend of law is not to abolish or restrain, but to preserve and enlarge\nfreedom: for in all the states of created beings capable of laws, where\nthere is no law, there is no freedom: for liberty is, to be free from\nrestraint and violence from others; which cannot be, where there is no\nlaw: but freedom is not, as we are told, a liberty for every man to do\nwhat he lists: (for who could be free, when every other man\u2019s humour\nmight domineer over him?) but a liberty to dispose, and order as he\nlists, his person, actions, possessions, and his whole property, within\nthe allowance of those laws under which he is, and therein not to be\nsubject to the arbitrary will of another, but freely follow his own.\nSect. 58. The power, then, that parents have over their children, arises\nfrom that duty which is incumbent on them, to take care of their\noff-spring, during the imperfect state of childhood. To inform the mind,\nand govern the actions of their yet ignorant nonage, till reason shall\ntake its place, and ease them of that trouble, is what the children\nwant, and the parents are bound to: for God having given man an\nunderstanding to direct his actions, has allowed him a freedom of will,\nand liberty of acting, as properly belonging thereunto, within the\nbounds of that law he is under. But whilst he is in an estate, wherein\nhe has not understanding of his own to direct his will, he is not to\nhave any will of his own to follow: he that understands for him, must\nwill for him too; he must prescribe to his will, and regulate his\nactions; but when he comes to the estate that made his father a freeman,\nthe son is a freeman too.\nSect. 59. This holds in all the laws a man is under, whether natural or\ncivil. Is a man under the law of nature? What made him free of that law?\nwhat gave him a free disposing of his property, according to his own\nwill, within the compass of that law? I answer, a state of maturity\nwherein he might be supposed capable to know that law, that so he might\nkeep his actions within the bounds of it. When he has acquired that\nstate, he is presumed to know how far that law is to be his guide, and\nhow far he may make use of his freedom, and so comes to have it; till\nthen, some body else must guide him, who is presumed to know how far the\nlaw allows a liberty. If such a state of reason, such an age of\ndiscretion made him free, the same shall make his son free too. Is a man\nunder the law of England? What made him free of that law? that is, to\nhave the liberty to dispose of his actions and possessions according to\nhis own will, within the permission of that law? A capacity of knowing\nthat law; which is supposed by that law, at the age of one and twenty\nyears, and in some cases sooner. If this made the father free, it shall\nmake the son free too. Till then we see the law allows the son to have\nno will, but he is to be guided by the will of his father or guardian,\nwho is to understand for him. And if the father die, and fail to\nsubstitute a deputy in his trust; if he hath not provided a tutor, to\ngovern his son, during his minority, during his want of understanding,\nthe law takes care to do it; some other must govern him, and be a will\nto him, till he hath attained to a state of freedom, and his\nunderstanding be fit to take the government of his will. But after that,\nthe father and son are equally free as much as tutor and pupil after\nnonage; equally subjects of the same law together, without any dominion\nleft in the father over the life, liberty, or estate of his son, whether\nthey be only in the state and under the law of nature, or under the\npositive laws of an established government.\nSect. 60. But if, through defects that may happen out of the ordinary\ncourse of nature, any one comes not to such a degree of reason, wherein\nhe might be supposed capable of knowing the law, and so living within\nthe rules of it, he is never capable of being a free man, he is never\nlet loose to the disposure of his own will (because he knows no bounds\nto it, has not understanding, its proper guide) but is continued under\nthe tuition and government of others, all the time his own understanding\nis uncapable of that charge. And so lunatics and ideots are never set\nfree from the government of their parents;\n/#\nchildren, who are not as yet come unto those years whereat they may\nhave; and innocents which are excluded by a natural defect from\never having; thirdly, madmen, which for the present cannot possibly\nhave the use of right reason to guide themselves, have for their\nguide, the reason that guideth other men which are tutors over\nthem, to seek and procure their good for them,\n#/\nsays Hooker, Eccl. Pol. lib. i. sec. 7. All which seems no more than\nthat duty, which God and nature has laid on man, as well as other\ncreatures, to preserve their offspring, till they can be able to shift\nfor themselves, and will scarce amount to an instance or proof of\nparents regal authority.\nSect. 61. Thus we are born free, as we are born rational; not that we\nhave actually the exercise of either: age, that brings one, brings with\nit the other too. And thus we see how natural freedom and subjection to\nparents may consist together, and are both founded on the same\nprinciple. A child is free by his father\u2019s title, by his father\u2019s\nunderstanding, which is to govern him till he hath it of his own. The\nfreedom of a man at years of discretion, and the subjection of a child\nto his parents, whilst yet short of that age, are so consistent, and so\ndistinguishable, that the most blinded contenders for monarchy, by right\nof fatherhood, cannot miss this difference; the most obstinate cannot\nbut allow their consistency: for were their doctrine all true, were the\nright heir of Adam now known, and by that title settled a monarch in his\nthrone, invested with all the absolute unlimited power Sir Robert Filmer\ntalks of; if he should die as soon as his heir were born, must not the\nchild, notwithstanding he were never so free, never so much sovereign,\nbe in subjection to his mother and nurse, to tutors and governors, till\nage and education brought him reason and ability to govern himself and\nothers? The necessities of his life, the health of his body, and the\ninformation of his mind, would require him to be directed by the will of\nothers, and not his own; and yet will any one think, that this restraint\nand subjection were inconsistent with, or spoiled him of that liberty or\nsovereignty he had a right to, or gave away his empire to those who had\nthe government of his nonage? This government over him only prepared him\nthe better and sooner for it. If any body should ask me, when my son is\nof age to be free? I shall answer, just when his monarch is of age to\ngovern. But at what time, says the judicious Hooker, Eccl. Pol. l. i.\nsect. 6. a man may be said to have attained so far forth the use of\nreason, as sufficeth to make him capable of those laws whereby he is\nthen bound to guide his actions: this is a great deal more easy for\nsense to discern, than for any one by skill and learning to determine.\nSect. 62. Common-wealths themselves take notice of, and allow, that\nthere is a time when men are to begin to act like free men, and\ntherefore till that time require not oaths of fealty, or allegiance, or\nother public owning of, or submission to the government of their\ncountries.\nSect. 63. The freedom then of man, and liberty of acting according to\nhis own will, is grounded on his having reason, which is able to\ninstruct him in that law he is to govern himself by, and make him know\nhow far he is left to the freedom of his own will. To turn him loose to\nan unrestrained liberty, before he has reason to guide him, is not the\nallowing him the privilege of his nature to be free; but to thrust him\nout amongst brutes, and abandon him to a state as wretched, and as much\nbeneath that of a man, as their\u2019s. This is that which puts the authority\ninto the parents hands to govern the minority of their children. God\nhath made it their business to employ this care on their offspring, and\nhath placed in them suitable inclinations of tenderness and concern to\ntemper this power, to apply it, as his wisdom designed it, to the\nchildren\u2019s good, as long as they should need to be under it.\nSect. 64. But what reason can hence advance this care of the parents due\nto their off-spring into an absolute arbitrary dominion of the father,\nwhose power reaches no farther, than by such a discipline, as he finds\nmost effectual, to give such strength and health to their bodies, such\nvigour and rectitude to their minds, as may best fit his children to be\nmost useful to themselves and others; and, if it be necessary to his\ncondition, to make them work, when they are able, for their own\nsubsistence. But in this power the mother too has her share with the\nfather.\nSect. 65. Nay, this power so little belongs to the father by any\npeculiar right of nature, but only as he is guardian of his children,\nthat when he quits his care of them, he loses his power over them, which\ngoes along with their nourishment and education, to which it is\ninseparably annexed; and it belongs as much to the foster-father of an\nexposed child, as to the natural father of another. So little power does\nthe bare act of begetting give a man over his issue; if all his care\nends there, and this be all the title he hath to the name and authority\nof a father. And what will become of this paternal power in that part of\nthe world, where one woman hath more than one husband at a time? or in\nthose parts of America, where, when the husband and wife part, which\nhappens frequently, the children are all left to the mother, follow her,\nand are wholly under her care and provision? If the father die whilst\nthe children are young, do they not naturally every where owe the same\nobedience to their mother, during their minority, as to their father\nwere he alive? and will any one say, that the mother hath a legislative\npower over her children? that she can make standing rules, which shall\nbe of perpetual obligation, by which they ought to regulate all the\nconcerns of their property, and bound their liberty all the course of\ntheir lives? or can she inforce the observation of them with capital\npunishments? for this is the proper power of the magistrate, of which\nthe father hath not so much as the shadow. His command over his children\nis but temporary, and reaches not their life or property: it is but a\nhelp to the weakness and imperfection of their nonage, a discipline\nnecessary to their education: and though a father may dispose of his own\npossessions as he pleases, when his children are out of danger of\nperishing for want, yet his power extends not to the lives or goods,\nwhich either their own industry, or another\u2019s bounty has made their\u2019s;\nnor to their liberty neither, when they are once arrived to the\ninfranchisement of the years of discretion. The father\u2019s empire then\nceases, and he can from thence forwards no more dispose of the liberty\nof his son, than that of any other man: and it must be far from an\nabsolute or perpetual jurisdiction, from which a man may withdraw\nhimself, having license from divine authority to leave father and\nmother, and cleave to his wife.\nSect. 66. But though there be a time when a child comes to be as free\nfrom subjection to the will and command of his father, as the father\nhimself is free from subjection to the will of any body else, and they\nare each under no other restraint, but that which is common to them\nboth, whether it be the law of nature, or municipal law of their\ncountry; yet this freedom exempts not a son from that honour which he\nought, by the law of God and nature, to pay his parents. God having made\nthe parents instruments in his great design of continuing the race of\nmankind, and the occasions of life to their children; as he hath laid on\nthem an obligation to nourish, preserve, and bring up their offspring;\nso he has laid on the children a perpetual obligation of honouring their\nparents, which containing in it an inward esteem and reverence to be\nshewn by all outward expressions, ties up the child from any thing that\nmay ever injure or affront, disturb or endanger, the happiness or life\nof those from whom he received his; and engages him in all actions of\ndefence, relief, assistance and comfort of those, by whose means he\nentered into being, and has been made capable of any enjoyments of life:\nfrom this obligation no state, no freedom can absolve children. But this\nis very far from giving parents a power of command over their children,\nor an authority to make laws and dispose as they please of their lives\nor liberties. It is one thing to owe honour, respect, gratitude and\nassistance; another to require an absolute obedience and submission. The\nhonour due to parents, a monarch in his throne owes his mother; and yet\nthis lessens not his authority, nor subjects him to her government.\nSect. 67. The subjection of a minor places in the father a temporary\ngovernment, which terminates with the minority of the child: and the\nhonour due from a child, places in the parents a perpetual right to\nrespect, reverence, support and compliance too, more or less, as the\nfather\u2019s care, cost, and kindness in his education, has been more or\nless. This ends not with minority, but holds in all parts and conditions\nof a man\u2019s life. The want of distinguishing these two powers, viz. that\nwhich the father hath in the right of tuition, during minority, and the\nright of honour all his life, may perhaps have caused a great part of\nthe mistakes about this matter: for to speak properly of them, the first\nof these is rather the privilege of children, and duty of parents, than\nany prerogative of paternal power. The nourishment and education of\ntheir children is a charge so incumbent on parents for their children\u2019s\ngood, that nothing can absolve them from taking care of it: and though\nthe power of commanding and chastising them go along with it, yet God\nhath woven into the principles of human nature such a tenderness for\ntheir off-spring, that there is little fear that parents should use\ntheir power with too much rigour; the excess is seldom on the severe\nside, the strong byass of nature drawing the other way. And therefore\nGod almighty when he would express his gentle dealing with the\nIsraelites, he tells them, that though he chastened them, he chastened\nthem as a man chastens his son, Deut. viii. 5. i.e. with tenderness and\naffection, and kept them under no severer discipline than what was\nabsolutely best for them, and had been less kindness to have slackened.\nThis is that power to which children are commanded obedience, that the\npains and care of their parents may not be increased, or ill rewarded.\nSect. 68. On the other side, honour and support, all that which\ngratitude requires to return for the benefits received by and from them,\nis the indispensable duty of the child, and the proper privilege of the\nparents. This is intended for the parents advantage, as the other is for\nthe child\u2019s; though education, the parents duty, seems to have most\npower, because the ignorance and infirmities of childhood stand in need\nof restraint and correction; which is a visible exercise of rule, and a\nkind of dominion. And that duty which is comprehended in the word\nhonour, requires less obedience, though the obligation be stronger on\ngrown, than younger children: for who can think the command, Children\nobey your parents, requires in a man, that has children of his own, the\nsame submission to his father, as it does in his yet young children to\nhim; and that by this precept he were bound to obey all his father\u2019s\ncommands, if, out of a conceit of authority, he should have the\nindiscretion to treat him still as a boy?\nSect. 69. The first part then of paternal power, or rather duty, which\nis education, belongs so to the father, that it terminates at a certain\nseason; when the business of education is over, it ceases of itself, and\nis also alienable before: for a man may put the tuition of his son in\nother hands; and he that has made his son an apprentice to another, has\ndischarged him, during that time, of a great part of his obedience both\nto himself and to his mother. But all the duty of honour, the other\npart, remains never the less entire to them; nothing can cancel that: it\nis so inseparable from them both, that the father\u2019s authority cannot\ndispossess the mother of this right, nor can any man discharge his son\nfrom honouring her that bore him. But both these are very far from a\npower to make laws, and enforcing them with penalties, that may reach\nestate, liberty, limbs and life. The power of commanding ends with\nnonage; and though, after that, honour and respect, support and defence,\nand whatsoever gratitude can oblige a man to, for the highest benefits\nhe is naturally capable of, be always due from a son to his parents; yet\nall this puts no scepter into the father\u2019s hand, no sovereign power of\ncommanding. He has no dominion over his son\u2019s property, or actions; nor\nany right, that his will should prescribe to his son\u2019s in all things;\nhowever it may become his son in many things, not very inconvenient to\nhim and his family, to pay a deference to it.\nSect. 70. A man may owe honour and respect to an ancient, or wise man;\ndefence to his child or friend; relief and support to the distressed;\nand gratitude to a benefactor, to such a degree, that all he has, all he\ncan do, cannot sufficiently pay it: but all these give no authority, no\nright to any one, of making laws over him from whom they are owing. And\nit is plain, all this is due not only to the bare title of father; not\nonly because, as has been said, it is owing to the mother too; but\nbecause these obligations to parents, and the degrees of what is\nrequired of children, may be varied by the different care and kindness,\ntrouble and expence, which is often employed upon one child more than\nanother.\nSect. 71. This shews the reason how it comes to pass, that parents in\nsocieties, where they themselves are subjects, retain a power over their\nchildren, and have as much right to their subjection, as those who are\nin the state of nature. Which could not possibly be, if all political\npower were only paternal, and that in truth they were one and the same\nthing: for then, all paternal power being in the prince, the subject\ncould naturally have none of it. But these two powers, political and\npaternal, are so perfectly distinct and separate; are built upon so\ndifferent foundations, and given to so different ends, that every\nsubject that is a father, has as much a paternal power over his\nchildren, as the prince has over his: and every prince, that has\nparents, owes them as much filial duty and obedience, as the meanest of\nhis subjects do to their\u2019s; and can therefore contain not any part or\ndegree of that kind of dominion, which a prince or magistrate has over\nhis subject.\nSect. 72. Though the obligation on the parents to bring up their\nchildren, and the obligation on children to honour their parents,\ncontain all the power on the one hand, and submission on the other,\nwhich are proper to this relation, yet there is another power ordinarily\nin the father, whereby he has a tie on the obedience of his children;\nwhich tho\u2019 it be common to him with other men, yet the occasions of\nshewing it, almost constantly happening to fathers in\ntheir private families, and the instances of it elsewhere being rare,\nand less taken notice of, it passes in the world for a part of paternal\njurisdiction. And this is the power men generally have to bestow their\nestates on those who please them best; the possession of the father\nbeing the expectation and inheritance of the children, ordinarily in\ncertain proportions, according to the law and custom of each country;\nyet it is commonly in the father\u2019s power to bestow it with a more\nsparing or liberal hand, according as the behaviour of this or that\nchild hath comported with his will and humour.\nSect. 73. This is no small tie on the obedience of children: and there\nbeing always annexed to the enjoyment of land, a submission to the\ngovernment of the country, of which that land is a part; it has been\ncommonly supposed, that a father could oblige his posterity to that\ngovernment, of which he himself was a subject, and that his compact held\nthem; whereas, it being only a necessary condition annexed to the land,\nand the inheritance of an estate which is under that government, reaches\nonly those who will take it on that condition, and so is no natural tie\nor engagement, but a voluntary submission: for every man\u2019s children\nbeing by nature as free as himself, or any of his ancestors ever were,\nmay, whilst they are in that freedom, choose what society they will join\nthemselves to, what commonwealth they will put themselves under. But if\nthey will enjoy the inheritance of their ancestors, they must take it on\nthe same terms their ancestors had it, and submit to all the conditions\nannexed to such a possession. By this power indeed fathers oblige their\nchildren to obedience to themselves, even when they are past minority,\nand most commonly too subject them to this or that political power: but\nneither of these by any peculiar right of fatherhood, but by the reward\nthey have in their hands to inforce and recompence such a compliance;\nand is no more power than what a French man has over an English man, who\nby the hopes of an estate he will leave him, will certainly have a\nstrong tie on his obedience: and if, when it is left him, he will enjoy\nit, he must certainly take it upon the conditions annexed to the\npossession of land in that country where it lies, whether it be France\nor England.\nSect. 74. To conclude then, tho\u2019 the father\u2019s power of commanding\nextends no farther than the minority of his children, and to a degree\nonly fit for the discipline and government of that age; and tho\u2019 that\nhonour and respect, and all that which the Latins called piety, which\nthey indispensably owe to their parents all their life-time, and in all\nestates, with all that support and defence is due to them, gives the\nfather no power of governing, i.e. making laws and enacting penalties on\nhis children; though by all this he has no dominion over the property or\nactions of his son: yet it is obvious to conceive how easy it was, in\nthe first ages of the world, and in places still, where the thinness of\npeople gives families leave to separate into unpossessed quarters, and\nthey have room to remove or plant themselves in yet vacant habitations,\nfor the father of the family to become the prince of it;* he had been a\nruler from the beginning of the infancy of his children: and since\nwithout some government it would be hard for them to live together, it\nwas likeliest it should, by the express or tacit consent of the children\nwhen they were grown up, be in the father, where it seemed without any\nchange barely to continue; when indeed nothing more was required to it,\nthan the permitting the father to exercise alone, in his family, that\nexecutive power of the law of nature, which every free man naturally\nhath, and by that permission resigning up to him a monarchical power,\nwhilst they remained in it. But that this was not by any paternal right,\nbut only by the consent of his children, is evident from hence, that no\nbody doubts, but if a stranger, whom chance or business had brought to\nhis family, had there killed any of his children, or committed any other\nfact, he might condemn and put him to death, or other-wise have punished\nhim, as well as any of his children; which it was impossible he should\ndo by virtue of any paternal authority over one who was not his child,\nbut by virtue of that executive power of the law of nature, which, as a\nman, he had a right to: and he alone could punish him in his family,\nwhere the respect of his children had laid by the exercise of such a\npower, to give way to the dignity and authority they were willing should\nremain in him, above the rest of his family.\n(*It is no improbable opinion therefore, which the archphilosopher was\nof, that the chief person in every houshold was always, as it were, a\nking: so when numbers of housholds joined themselves in civil societies\ntogether, kings were the first kind of governors amongst them, which is\nalso, as it seemeth, the reason why the name of fathers continued still\nin them, who, of fathers, were made rulers; as also the ancient custom\nof governors to do as Melchizedec, and being kings, to exercise the\noffice of priests, which fathers did at the first, grew perhaps by the\nsame occasion. Howbeit, this is not the only kind of regiment that has\nbeen received in the world. The inconveniences of one kind have caused\nsundry others to be devised; so that in a word, all public regiment, of\nwhat kind soever, seemeth evidently to have risen from the deliberate\nadvice, consultation and composition between men, judging it convenient\nand behoveful; there being no impossibility in nature considered by\nitself, but that man might have lived without any public regiment,\nHooker\u2019s Eccl. Pol. lib. i. sect. 10.)\nSect. 75. Thus it was easy, and almost natural for children, by a tacit,\nand scarce avoidable consent, to make way for the father\u2019s authority and\ngovernment. They had been accustomed in their childhood to follow his\ndirection, and to refer their little differences to him, and when they\nwere men, who fitter to rule them? Their little properties, and less\ncovetousness, seldom afforded greater controversies; and when any should\narise, where could they have a fitter umpire than he, by whose care they\nhad every one been sustained and brought up, and who had a tenderness\nfor them all? It is no wonder that they made no distinction betwixt\nminority and full age; nor looked after one and twenty, or any other age\nthat might make them the free disposers of themselves and fortunes, when\nthey could have no desire to be out of their pupilage: the government\nthey had been under, during it, continued still to be more their\nprotection than restraint; and they could no where find a greater\nsecurity to their peace, liberties, and fortunes, than in the rule of a\nfather.\nSect. 76. Thus the natural fathers of families, by an insensible change,\nbecame the politic monarchs of them too: and as they chanced to live\nlong, and leave able and worthy heirs, for several successions, or\notherwise; so they laid the foundations of hereditary, or elective\nkingdoms, under several constitutions and manners, according as chance,\ncontrivance, or occasions happened to mould them. But if princes have\ntheir titles in their fathers right, and it be a sufficient proof of the\nnatural right of fathers to political authority, because they commonly\nwere those in whose hands we find, de facto, the exercise of government:\nI say, if this argument be good, it will as strongly prove, that all\nprinces, nay princes only, ought to be priests, since it is as certain,\nthat in the beginning, the father of the family was priest, as that he\nwas ruler in his own houshold.\nCHAPTER. VII.\nOF POLITICAL OR CIVIL SOCIETY.\nSect. 77. GOD having made man such a creature, that in his own judgment,\nit was not good for him to be alone, put him under strong obligations of\nnecessity, convenience, and inclination to drive him into society, as\nwell as fitted him with understanding and language to continue and enjoy\nit. The first society was between man and wife, which gave beginning to\nthat between parents and children; to which, in time, that between\nmaster and servant came to be added: and though all these might, and\ncommonly did meet together, and make up but one family, wherein the\nmaster or mistress of it had some sort of rule proper to a family; each\nof these, or all together, came short of political society, as we shall\nsee, if we consider the different ends, ties, and bounds of each of\nthese.\nSect. 78. Conjugal society is made by a voluntary compact between man\nand woman; and tho\u2019 it consist chiefly in such a communion and right in\none another\u2019s bodies as is necessary to its chief end, procreation; yet\nit draws with it mutual support and assistance, and a communion of\ninterests too, as necessary not only to unite their care and affection,\nbut also necessary to their common off-spring, who have a right to be\nnourished, and maintained by them, till they are able to provide for\nthemselves.\nSect. 79. For the end of conjunction, between male and female, being not\nbarely procreation, but the continuation of the species; thisconjunction\nbetwixt male and female ought to last, even after procreation, so long\nas is necessary to the nourishment and support of the young ones, who\nare to be sustained by those that got them, till they are able to shift\nand provide for themselves. This rule, which the infinite wise maker\nhath set to the works of his hands, we find the inferior creatures\nsteadily obey. In those viviparous animals which feed on grass, the\nconjunction between male and female lasts no longer than the very act of\ncopulation; because the teat of the dam being sufficient to nourish the\nyoung, till it be able to feed on grass, the male only begets, but\nconcerns not himself for the female or young, to whose sustenance he can\ncontribute nothing. But in beasts of prey the conjunction lasts longer:\nbecause the dam not being able well to subsist herself, and nourish her\nnumerous off-spring by her own prey alone, a more laborious, as well as\nmore dangerous way of living, than by feeding on grass, the assistance\nof the male is necessary to the maintenance of their common family,\nwhich cannot subsist till they are able to prey for themselves, but by\nthe joint care of male and female. The same is to be observed in all\nbirds, (except some domestic ones, where plenty of food excuses the cock\nfrom feeding, and taking care of the young brood) whose young needing\nfood in the nest, the cock and hen continue mates, till the young are\nable to use their wing, and provide for themselves.\nSect. 80. And herein I think lies the chief, if not the only reason, why\nthe male and female in mankind are tied to a longer conjunction than\nother creatures, viz. because the female is capable of conceiving, and\nde facto is commonly with child again, and brings forth too a new birth,\nlong before the former is out of a dependency for support on his parents\nhelp, and able to shift for himself, and has all the assistance is due\nto him from his parents: whereby the father, who is bound to take care\nfor those he hath begot, is under an obligation to continue in conjugal\nsociety with the same woman longer than other creatures, whose young\nbeing able to subsist of themselves, before the time of procreation\nreturns again, the conjugal bond dissolves of itself, and they are at\nliberty, till Hymen at his usual anniversary season summons them again\nto chuse new mates. Wherein one cannot but admire the wisdom of the\ngreat Creator, who having given to man foresight, and an ability to lay\nup for the future, as well as to supply the present necessity, hath made\nit necessary, that society of man and wife should be more lasting, than\nof male and female amongst other creatures; that so their industry might\nbe encouraged, and their interest better united, to make provision and\nlay up goods for their common issue, which uncertain mixture, or easy\nand frequent solutions of conjugal society would mightily disturb.\nSect. 81. But tho\u2019 these are ties upon mankind, which make the conjugal\nbonds more firm and lasting in man, than the other species of animals;\nyet it would give one reason to enquire, why this compact, where\nprocreation and education are secured, and inheritance taken care for,\nmay not be made determinable, either by consent, or at a certain time,\nor upon certain conditions, as well as any other voluntary compacts,\nthere being no necessity in the nature of the thing, nor to the ends of\nit, that it should always be for life; I mean, to such as are under no\nrestraint of any positive law, which ordains all such contracts to be\nperpetual.\nSect. 82. But the husband and wife, though they have but one common\nconcern, yet having different understandings, will unavoidably sometimes\nhave different wills too; it therefore being necessary that the last\ndetermination, i. e. the rule, should be placed somewhere; it naturally\nfalls to the man\u2019s share, as the abler and the stronger. But this\nreaching but to the things of their common interest and property, leaves\nthe wife in the full and free possession of what by contract is her\npeculiar right, and gives the husband no more power over her life than\nshe has over his; the power of the husband being so far from that of an\nabsolute monarch, that the wife has in many cases a liberty to separate\nfrom him, where natural right, or their contract allows it; whether that\ncontract be made by themselves in the state of nature, or by the customs\nor laws of the country they live in; and the children upon such\nseparation fall to the father or mother\u2019s lot, as such contract does\ndetermine.\nSect. 83. For all the ends of marriage being to be obtained under\npolitic government, as well as in the state of nature, the civil\nmagistrate doth not abridge the right or power of either naturally\nnecessary to those ends, viz. procreation and mutual support and\nassistance whilst they are together; but only decides any controversy\nthat may arise between man and wife about them. If it were otherwise,\nand that absolute sovereignty and power of life and death naturally\nbelonged to the husband, and were necessary to the society between man\nand wife, there could be no matrimony in any of those countries where\nthe husband is allowed no such absolute authority. But the ends of\nmatrimony requiring no such power in the husband, the condition of\nconjugal society put it not in him, it being not at all necessary to\nthat state. Conjugal society could subsist and attain its ends without\nit; nay, community of goods, and the power over them, mutual assistance\nand maintenance, and other things belonging to conjugal society, might\nbe varied and regulated by that contract which unites man and wife in\nthat society, as far as may consist with procreation and the bringing up\nof children till they could shift for themselves; nothing being\nnecessary to any society, that is not necessary to the ends for which it\nis made.\nSect. 84. The society betwixt parents and children, and the distinct\nrights and powers belonging respectively to them, I have treated of so\nlargely, in the foregoing chapter, that I shall not here need to say any\nthing of it. And I think it is plain, that it is far different from a\npolitic society.\nSect. 85. Master and servant are names as old as history, but given to\nthose of far different condition; for a freeman makes himself a servant\nto another, by selling him, for a certain time, the service he\nundertakes to do, in exchange for wages he is to receive: and though\nthis commonly puts him into the family of his master, and under the\nordinary discipline thereof; yet it gives the master but a temporary\npower over him, and no greater than what is contained in the contract\nbetween them. But there is another sort of servants, which by a peculiar\nname we call slaves, who being captives taken in a just war, are by the\nright of nature subjected to the absolute dominion and arbitrary power\nof their masters. These men having, as I say, forfeited their lives, and\nwith it their liberties, and lost their estates; and being in the state\nof slavery, not capable of any property, cannot in that state be\nconsidered as any part of civil society; the chief end whereof is the\npreservation of property.\nSect. 86. Let us therefore consider a master of a family with all these\nsubordinate relations of wife, children, servants, and slaves, united\nunder the domestic rule of a family; which, what resemblance soever it\nmay have in its order, offices, and number too, with a little\ncommonwealth, yet is very far from it, both in its constitution, power\nand end: or if it must be thought a monarchy, and the paterfamilias the\nabsolute monarch in it, absolute monarchy will have but a very shattered\nand short power, when it is plain, by what has been said before, that\nthe master of the family has a very distinct and differently limited\npower, both as to time and extent, over those several persons that are\nin it; for excepting the slave (and the family is as much a family, and\nhis power as paterfamilias as great, whether there be any slaves in his\nfamily or no) he has no legislative power of life and death over any of\nthem, and none too but what a mistress of a family may have as well as\nhe. And he certainly can have no absolute power over the whole family,\nwho has but a very limited one over every individual in it. But how a\nfamily, or any other society of men, differ from that which is properly\npolitical society, we shall best see, by considering wherein political\nsociety itself consists.\nSect. 87. Man being born, as has been proved, with a title to perfect\nfreedom, and an uncontrouled enjoyment of all the rights and privileges\nof the law of nature, equally with any other man, or number of men in\nthe world, hath by nature a power, not only to preserve his property,\nthat is, his life, liberty and estate, against the injuries and attempts\nof other men; but to judge of, and punish the breaches of that law in\nothers, as he is persuaded the offence deserves, even with death itself,\nin crimes where the heinousness of the fact, in his opinion, requires\nit. But because no political society can be, nor subsist, without having\nin itself the power to preserve the property, and in order thereunto,\npunish the offences of all those of that society; there, and there only\nis political society, where every one of the members hath quitted this\nnatural power, resigned it up into the hands of the community in all\ncases that exclude him not from appealing for protection to the law\nestablished by it. And thus all private judgment of every particular\nmember being excluded, the community comes to be umpire, by settled\nstanding rules, indifferent, and the same to all parties; and by men\nhaving authority from the community, for the execution of those rules,\ndecides all the differences that may happen between any members of that\nsociety concerning any matter of right; and punishes those offences\nwhich any member hath committed against the society, with such penalties\nas the law has established: whereby it is easy to discern, who are, and\nwho are not, in political society together. Those who are united into\none body, and have a common established law and judicature to appeal to,\nwith authority to decide controversies between them, and punish\noffenders, are in civil society one with another: but those who have no\nsuch common appeal, I mean on earth, are still in the state of nature,\neach being, where there is no other, judge for himself, and executioner;\nwhich is, as I have before shewed it, the perfect state of nature.\nSect. 88. And thus the commonwealth comes by a power to set down what\npunishment shall belong to the several transgressions which they think\nworthy of it, committed amongst the members of that society, (which is\nthe power of making laws) as well as it has the power to punish any\ninjury done unto any of its members, by any one that is not of it,\n(which is the power of war and peace;) and all this for the preservation\nof the property of all the members of that society, as far as is\npossible. But though every man who has entered into civil society, and\nis become a member of any commonwealth, has thereby quitted his power to\npunish offences, against the law of nature, in prosecution of his own\nprivate judgment, yet with the judgment of offences, which he has given\nup to the legislative in all cases, where he can appeal to the\nmagistrate, he has given a right to the commonwealth to employ his\nforce, for the execution of the judgments of the commonwealth, whenever\nhe shall be called to it; which indeed are his own judgments, they being\nmade by himself, or his representative. And herein we have the original\nof the legislative and executive power of civil society, which is to\njudge by standing laws, how far offences are to be punished, when\ncommitted within the commonwealth; and also to determine, by occasional\njudgments founded on the present circumstances of the fact, how far\ninjuries from without are to be vindicated; and in both these to employ\nall the force of all the members, when there shall be need.\nSect. 89. Where-ever therefore any number of men are so united into one\nsociety, as to quit every one his executive power of the law of nature,\nand to resign it to the public, there and there only is a political, or\ncivil society. And this is done, where-ever any number of men, in the\nstate of nature, enter into society to make one people, one body\npolitic, under one supreme government; or else when any one joins\nhimself to, and incorporates with any government already made: for\nhereby he authorizes the society, or which is all one, the legislative\nthereof, to make laws for him, as the public good of the society shall\nrequire; to the execution whereof, his own assistance (as to his own\ndecrees) is due. And this puts men out of a state of nature into that of\na commonwealth, by setting up a judge on earth, with authority to\ndetermine all the controversies, and redress the injuries that may\nhappen to any member of the commonwealth; which judge is the\nlegislative, or magistrates appointed by it. And where-ever there are\nany number of men, however associated, that have no such decisive power\nto appeal to, there they are still in the state of nature.\nSect. 90. Hence it is evident, that absolute monarchy, which by some men\nis counted the only government in the world, is indeed inconsistent with\ncivil society, and so can be no form of civil-government at all: for the\nend of civil society, being to avoid, and remedy those inconveniencies\nof the state of nature, which necessarily follow from every man\u2019s being\njudge in his own case, by setting up a known authority, to which every\none of that society may appeal upon any injury received, or controversy\nthat may arise, and which every one of the society ought to obey;*\nwhere-ever any persons are, who have not such an authority to appeal to,\nfor the decision of any difference between them, there those persons are\nstill in the state of nature; and so is every absolute prince, in\nrespect of those who are under his dominion.\n(*The public power of all society is above every soul contained in the\nsame society; and the principal use of that power is, to give laws unto\nall that are under it, which laws in such cases we must obey, unless\nthere be reason shewed which may necessarily inforce, that the law of\nreason, or of God, doth enjoin the contrary, Hook. Eccl. Pol. l. i.\nsect. 16.)\nSect. 91. For he being supposed to have all, both legislative and\nexecutive power in himself alone, there is no judge to be found, no\nappeal lies open to any one, who may fairly, and indifferently, and with\nauthority decide, and from whose decision relief and redress may be\nexpected of any injury or inconviency, that may be suffered from the\nprince, or by his order: so that such a man, however intitled, Czar, or\nGrand Seignior, or how you please, is as much in the state of nature,\nwith all under his dominion, as he is with the rest of mankind: for\nwhere-ever any two men are, who have no standing rule, and common judge\nto appeal to on earth, for the determination of controversies of right\nbetwixt them, there they are still in the state of* nature, and under\nall the inconveniencies of it, with only this woful difference to the\nsubject, or rather slave of an absolute prince: that whereas, in the\nordinary state of nature, he has a liberty to judge of his right, and\naccording to the best of his power, to maintain it; now, whenever his\nproperty is invaded by the will and order of his monarch, he has not\nonly no appeal, as those in society ought to have, but as if he were\ndegraded from the common state of rational creatures, is denied a\nliberty to judge of, or to defend his right; and so is exposed to all\nthe misery and inconveniencies, that a man can fear from one, who being\nin the unrestrained state of nature, is yet corrupted with flattery, and\narmed with power.\n(*To take away all such mutual grievances, injuries and wrongs, i.e.\nsuch as attend men in the state of nature, there was no way but only by\ngrowing into composition and agreement amongst themselves, by ordaining\nsome kind of govemment public, and by yielding themselves subject\nthereunto, that unto whom they granted authority to rule and govem, by\nthem the peace, tranquillity and happy estate of the rest might be\nprocured. Men always knew that where force and injury was offered, they\nmight be defenders of themselves; they knew that however men may seek\ntheir own commodity, yet if this were done with injury unto others, it\nwas not to be suffered, but by all men, and all good means to be\nwithstood. Finally, they knew that no man might in reason take upon him\nto determine his own right, and according to his own determination\nproceed in maintenance thereof, in as much as every man is towards\nhimself, and them whom he greatly affects, partial; and therefore that\nstrifes and troubles would be endless, except they gave their common\nconsent, all to be ordered by some, whom they should agree upon, without\nwhich consent there would be no reason that one man should take upon him\nto be lord or judge over another, Hooker\u2019s Eccl. Pol. l. i. sect. 10.)\nSect. 92. For he that thinks absolute power purifies men\u2019s blood, and\ncorrects the baseness of human nature, need read but the history of\nthis, or any other age, to be convinced of the contrary. He that would\nhave been insolent and injurious in the woods of America, would not\nprobably be much better in a throne; where perhaps learning and religion\nshall be found out to justify all that he shall do to his subjects, and\nthe sword presently silence all those that dare question it: for what\nthe protection of absolute monarchy is, what kind of fathers of their\ncountries it makes princes to be and to what a degree of happiness and\nsecurity it carries civil society, where this sort of government is\ngrown to perfection, he that will look into the late relation of Ceylon,\nmay easily see.\nSect. 93. In absolute monarchies indeed, as well as other governments of\nthe world, the subjects have an appeal to the law, and judges to decide\nany controversies, and restrain any violence that may happen betwixt the\nsubjects themselves, one amongst another. This every one thinks\nnecessary, and believes he deserves to be thought a declared enemy to\nsociety and mankind, who should go about to take it away. But whether\nthis be from a true love of mankind and society, and such a charity as\nwe owe all one to another, there is reason to doubt: for this is no more\nthan what every man, who loves his own power, profit, or greatness, may\nand naturally must do, keep those animals from hurting, or destroying\none another, who labour and drudge only for his pleasure and advantage;\nand so are taken care of, not out of any love the master has for them,\nbut love of himself, and the profit they bring him: for if it be asked,\nwhat security, what fence is there, in such a state, against the\nviolence and oppression of this absolute ruler? the very question can\nscarce be borne. They are ready to tell you, that it deserves death only\nto ask after safety. Betwixt subject and subject, they will grant, there\nmust be measures, laws and judges, for their mutual peace and security:\nbut as for the ruler, he ought to be absolute, and is above all such\ncircumstances; because he has power to do more hurt and wrong, it is\nright when he does it. To ask how you may be guarded from harm, or\ninjury, on that side where the strongest hand is to do it, is presently\nthe voice of faction and rebellion: as if when men quitting the state of\nnature entered into society, they agreed that all of them but one,\nshould be under the restraint of laws, but that he should still retain\nall the liberty of the state of nature, increased with power, and made\nlicentious by impunity. This is to think, that men are so foolish, that\nthey take care to avoid what mischiefs may be done them by pole-cats, or\nfoxes; but are content, nay, think it safety, to be devoured by lions.\nSect. 94. But whatever flatterers may talk to amuse people\u2019s\nunderstandings, it hinders not men from feeling; and when they perceive,\nthat any man, in what station soever, is out of the bounds of the civil\nsociety which they are of, and that they have no appeal on earth against\nany harm, they may receive from him, they are apt to think themselves in\nthe state of nature, in respect of him whom they find to be so; and to\ntake care, as soon as they can, to have that safety and security in\ncivil society, for which it was first instituted, and for which only\nthey entered into it. And therefore, though perhaps at first, (as shall\nbe shewed more at large hereafter in the following part of this\ndiscourse) some one good and excellent man having got a pre-eminency\namongst the rest, had this deference paid to his goodness and virtue, as\nto a kind of natural authority, that the chief rule, with arbitration of\ntheir differences, by a tacit consent devolved into his hands, without\nany other caution, but the assurance they had of his uprightness and\nwisdom; yet when time, giving authority, and (as some men would persuade\nus) sacredness of customs, which the negligent, and unforeseeing\ninnocence of the first ages began, had brought in successors of another\nstamp, the people finding their properties not secure under the\ngovernment, as then it was, (whereas government has no other end but the\npreservation of* property) could never be safe nor at rest, nor think\nthemselves in civil society, till the legislature was placed in\ncollective bodies of men, call them senate, parliament, or what you\nplease. By which means every single person became subject, equally with\nother the meanest men, to those laws, which he himself, as part of the\nlegislative, had established; nor could any one, by his own authority;\navoid the force of the law, when once made; nor by any pretence of\nsuperiority plead exemption, thereby to license his own, or the\nmiscarriages of any of his dependents.** No man in civil society can be\nexempted from the laws of it: for if any man may do what he thinks fit,\nand there be no appeal on earth, for redress or security against any\nharm he shall do; I ask, whether he be not perfectly still in the state\nof nature, and so can be no part or member of that civil society; unless\nany one will say, the state of nature and civil society are one and the\nsame thing, which I have never yet found any one so great a patron of\nanarchy as to affirm.\n(*At the first, when some certain kind of regiment was once appointed,\nit may be that nothing was then farther thought upon for the manner of\ngoveming, but all permitted unto their wisdom and discretion, which were\nto rule, till by experience they found this for all parts very\ninconvenient, so as the thing which they had devised for a remedy, did\nindeed but increase the sore, which it should have cured. They saw, that\nto live by one man\u2019s will, became the cause of all men\u2019s misery. This\nconstrained them to come unto laws, wherein all men might see their duty\nbeforehand, and know the penalties of transgressing them. Hooker\u2019s Eccl.\nPol. l. i. sect. 10.)\n(**Civil law being the act of the whole body politic, doth therefore\nover-rule each several part of the same body. Hooker, ibid.)\nCHAPTER. VIII.\nOF THE BEGINNING OF POLITICAL SOCIETIES.\nSect. 95. MEN being, as has been said, by nature, all free, equal, and\nindependent, no one can be put out of this estate, and subjected to the\npolitical power of another, without his own consent. The only way\nwhereby any one divests himself of his natural liberty, and puts on the\nbonds of civil society, is by agreeing with other men to join and unite\ninto a community for their comfortable, safe, and peaceable living one\namongst another, in a secure enjoyment of their properties, and a\ngreater security against any, that are not of it. This any number of men\nmay do, because it injures not the freedom of the rest; they are left as\nthey were in the liberty of the state of nature. When any number of men\nhave so consented to make one community or government, they are thereby\npresently incorporated, and make one body politic, wherein the majority\nhave a right to act and conclude the rest.\nSect. 96. For when any number of men have, by the consent of every\nindividual, made a community, they have thereby made that community one\nbody, with a power to act as one body, which is only by the will and\ndetermination of the majority: for that which acts any community, being\nonly the consent of the individuals of it, and it being necessary to\nthat which is one body to move one way; it is necessary the body should\nmove that way whither the greater force carries it, which is the consent\nof the majority: or else it is impossible it should act or continue one\nbody, one community, which the consent of every individual that united\ninto it, agreed that it should; and so every one is bound by that\nconsent to be concluded by the majority. And therefore we see, that in\nassemblies, impowered to act by positive laws, where no number is set by\nthat positive law which impowers them, the act of the majority passes\nfor the act of the whole, and of course determines, as having, by the\nlaw of nature and reason, the power of the whole.\nSect. 97. And thus every man, by consenting with others to make one body\npolitic under one government, puts himself under an obligation, to every\none of that society, to submit to the determination of the majority, and\nto be concluded by it; or else this original compact, whereby he with\nothers incorporates into one society, would signify nothing, and be no\ncompact, if he be left free, and under no other ties than he was in\nbefore in the state of nature. For what appearance would there be of any\ncompact? what new engagement if he were no farther tied by any decrees\nof the society, than he himself thought fit, and did actually consent\nto? This would be still as great a liberty, as he himself had before his\ncompact, or any one else in the state of nature hath, who may submit\nhimself, and consent to any acts of it if he thinks fit.\nSect. 98. For if the consent of the majority shall not, in reason, be\nreceived as the act of the whole, and conclude every individual; nothing\nbut the consent of every individual can make any thing to be the act of\nthe whole: but such a consent is next to impossible ever to be had, if\nwe consider the infirmities of health, and avocations of business, which\nin a number, though much less than that of a commonwealth, will\nnecessarily keep many away from the public assembly. To which if we add\nthe variety of opinions, and contrariety of interests, which unavoidably\nhappen in all collections of men, the coming into society upon such\nterms would be only like Cato\u2019s coming into the theatre, only to go out\nagain. Such a constitution as this would make the mighty Leviathan of a\nshorter duration, than the feeblest creatures, and not let it outlast\nthe day it was born in: which cannot be supposed, till we can think,\nthat rational creatures should desire and constitute societies only to\nbe dissolved: for where the majority cannot conclude the rest, there\nthey cannot act as one body, and consequently will be immediately\ndissolved again.\nSect. 99. Whosoever therefore out of a state of nature unite into a\ncommunity, must be understood to give up all the power, necessary to the\nends for which they unite into society, to the majority of the\ncommunity, unless they expresly agreed in any number greater than the\nmajority. And this is done by barely agreeing to unite into one\npolitical society, which is all the compact that is, or needs be,\nbetween the individuals, that enter into, or make up a commonwealth. And\nthus that, which begins and actually constitutes any political society,\nis nothing but the consent of any number of freemen capable of a\nmajority to unite and incorporate into such a society. And this is that,\nand that only, which did, or could give beginning to any lawful\ngovernment in the world.\nSect. 100. To this I find two objections made. First, That there are no\ninstances to be found in story, of a company of men independent, and\nequal one amongst another, that met together, and in this way began and\nset up a government.\nSecondly, It is impossible of right, that men should do so, because all\nmen being born under government, they are to submit to that, and are not\nat liberty to begin a new one.\nSect. 101. To the first there is this to answer, That it is not at all\nto be wondered, that history gives us but a very little account of men,\nthat lived together in the state of nature. The inconveniences of that\ncondition, and the love and want of society, no sooner brought any\nnumber of them together, but they presently united and incorporated, if\nthey designed to continue together. And if we may not suppose men ever\nto have been in the state of nature, because we hear not much of them in\nsuch a state, we may as well suppose the armies of Salmanasser or Xerxes\nwere never children, because we hear little of them, till they were men,\nand imbodied in armies. Government is every where antecedent to records,\nand letters seldom come in amongst a people till a long continuation of\ncivil society has, by other more necessary arts, provided for their\nsafety, ease, and plenty: and then they begin to look after the history\nof their founders, and search into their original, when they have\noutlived the memory of it: for it is with commonwealths as with\nparticular persons, they are commonly ignorant of their own births and\ninfancies: and if they know any thing of their original, they are\nbeholden for it, to the accidental records that others have kept of it.\nAnd those that we have, of the beginning of any polities in the world,\nexcepting that of the Jews, where God himself immediately interposed,\nand which favours not at all paternal dominion, are all either plain\ninstances of such a beginning as I have mentioned, or at least have\nmanifest footsteps of it.\nSect. 102. He must shew a strange inclination to deny evident matter of\nfact, when it agrees not with his hypothesis, who will not allow, that\nthe beginning of Rome and Venice were by the uniting together of several\nmen free and independent one of another, amongst whom there was no\nnatural superiority or subjection. And if Josephus Acosta\u2019s word may be\ntaken, he tells us, that in many parts of America there was no\ngovernment at all.\nThere are great and apparent conjectures, says he, that these men,\nspeaking of those of Peru, for a long time had neither kings nor\ncommonwealths, but lived in troops, as they do this day in Florida, the\nCheriquanas, those of Brazil, and many other nations, which have no\ncertain kings, but as occasion is offered, in peace or war, they choose\ntheir captains as they please, 1. i. c. 25.\nIf it be said, that every man there was born subject to his father, or\nthe head of his family; that the subjection due from a child to a father\ntook not away his freedom of uniting into what political society he\nthought fit, has been already proved. But be that as it will, these men,\nit is evident, were actually free; and whatever superiority some\npoliticians now would place in any of them, they themselves claimed it\nnot, but by consent were all equal, till by the same consent they set\nrulers over themselves. So that their politic societies all began from a\nvoluntary union, and the mutual agreement of men freely acting in the\nchoice of their governors, and forms of government.\nSect. 103. And I hope those who went away from Sparta with Palantus,\nmentioned by Justin, 1. iii. c. 4. will be allowed to have been freemen\nindependent one of another, and to have set up a government over\nthemselves, by their own consent. Thus I have given several examples,\nout of history, of people free and in the state of nature, that being\nmet together incorporated and began a commonwealth. And if the want of\nsuch instances be an argument to prove that government were not, nor\ncould not be so begun, I suppose the contenders for paternal empire were\nbetter let it alone, than urge it against natural liberty: for if they\ncan give so many instances, out of history, of governments begun upon\npaternal right, I think (though at best an argument from what has been,\nto what should of right be, has no great force) one might, without any\ngreat danger, yield them the cause. But if I might advise them in the\ncase, they would do well not to search too much into the original of\ngovernments, as they have begun de facto, lest they should find, at the\nfoundation of most of them, something very little favourable to the\ndesign they promote, and such a power as they contend for.\nSect. 104. But to conclude, reason being plain on our side, that men are\nnaturally free, and the examples of history shewing, that the\ngovernments of the world, that were begun in peace, had their beginning\nlaid on that foundation, and were made by the consent of the people;\nthere can be little room for doubt, either where the right is, or what\nhas been the opinion, or practice of mankind, about the first erecting\nof governments.\nSect. 105. I will not deny, that if we look back as far as history will\ndirect us, towards the original of commonwealths, we shall generally\nfind them under the government and administration of one man. And I am\nalso apt to believe, that where a family was numerous enough to subsist\nby itself, and continued entire together, without mixing with others, as\nit often happens, where there is much land, and few people, the\ngovernment commonly began in the father: for the father having, by the\nlaw of nature, the same power with every man else to punish, as he\nthought fit, any offences against that law, might thereby punish his\ntransgressing children, even when they were men, and out of their\npupilage; and they were very likely to submit to his punishment, and all\njoin with him against the offender, in their turns, giving him thereby\npower to execute his sentence against any transgression, and so in\neffect make him the law-maker, and governor over all that remained in\nconjunction with his family. He was fittest to be trusted; paternal\naffection secured their property and interest under his care; and the\ncustom of obeying him, in their childhood, made it easier to submit to\nhim, rather than to any other. If therefore they must have one to rule\nthem, as government is hardly to be avoided amongst men that live\ntogether; who so likely to be the man as he that was their common\nfather; unless negligence, cruelty, or any other defect of mind or body\nmade him unfit for it? But when either the father died, and left his\nnext heir, for want of age, wisdom, courage, or any other qualities,\nless fit for rule; or where several families met, and consented to\ncontinue together; there, it is not to be doubted, but they used their\nnatural freedom, to set up him, whom they judged the ablest, and most\nlikely, to rule well over them. Conformable hereunto we find the people\nof America, who (living out of the reach of the conquering swords, and\nspreading domination of the two great empires of Peru and Mexico)\nenjoyed their own natural freedom, though, caeteris paribus, they\ncommonly prefer the heir of their deceased king; yet if they find him\nany way weak, or uncapable, they pass him by, and set up the stoutest\nand bravest man for their ruler.\nSect. 106. Thus, though looking back as far as records give us any\naccount of peopling the world, and the history of nations, we commonly\nfind the government to be in one hand; yet it destroys not that which I\naffirm, viz. that the beginning of politic society depends upon the\nconsent of the individuals, to join into, and make one society; who,\nwhen they are thus incorporated, might set up what form of government\nthey thought fit. But this having given occasion to men to mistake, and\nthink, that by nature government was monarchical, and belonged to the\nfather, it may not be amiss here to consider, why people in the\nbeginning generally pitched upon this form, which though perhaps the\nfather\u2019s pre-eminency might, in the first institution of some\ncommonwealths, give a rise to, and place in the beginning, the power in\none hand; yet it is plain that the reason, that continued the form of\ngovernment in a single person, was not any regard, or respect to\npaternal authority; since all petty monarchies, that is, almost all\nmonarchies, near their original, have been commonly, at least upon\noccasion, elective.\nSect. 107. First then, in the beginning of things, the father\u2019s\ngovernment of the childhood of those sprung from him, having accustomed\nthem to the rule of one man, and taught them that where it was exercised\nwith care and skill, with affection and love to those under it, it was\nsufficient to procure and preserve to men all the political happiness\nthey sought for in society. It was no wonder that they should pitch\nupon, and naturally run into that form of government, which from their\ninfancy they had been all accustomed to; and which, by experience, they\nhad found both easy and safe. To which, if we add, that monarchy being\nsimple, and most obvious to men, whom neither experience had instructed\nin forms of government, nor the ambition or insolence of empire had\ntaught to beware of the encroachments of prerogative, or the\ninconveniences of absolute power, which monarchy in succession was apt\nto lay claim to, and bring upon them, it was not at all strange, that\nthey should not much trouble themselves to think of methods of\nrestraining any exorbitances of those to whom they had given the\nauthority over them, and of balancing the power of government, by\nplacing several parts of it in different hands. They had neither felt\nthe oppression of tyrannical dominion, nor did the fashion of the age,\nnor their possessions, or way of living, (which afforded little matter\nfor covetousness or ambition) give them any reason to apprehend or\nprovide against it; and therefore it is no wonder they put themselves\ninto such a frame of government, as was not only, as I said, most\nobvious and simple, but also best suited to their present state and\ncondition; which stood more in need of defence against foreign invasions\nand injuries, than of multiplicity of laws. The equality of a simple\npoor way of living, confining their desires within the narrow bounds of\neach man\u2019s small property, made few controversies, and so no need of\nmany laws to decide them, or variety of officers to superintend the\nprocess, or look after the execution of justice, where there were but\nfew trespasses, and few offenders. Since then those, who like one\nanother so well as to join into society, cannot but be supposed to have\nsome acquaintance and friendship together, and some trust one in\nanother; they could not but have greater apprehensions of others, than\nof one another: and therefore their first care and thought cannot but be\nsupposed to be, how to secure themselves against foreign force. It was\nnatural for them to put themselves under a frame of government which\nmight best serve to that end, and chuse the wisest and bravest man to\nconduct them in their wars, and lead them out against their enemies, and\nin this chiefly be their ruler.\nSect. 108. Thus we see, that the kings of the Indians in America, which\nis still a pattern of the first ages in Asia and Europe, whilst the\ninhabitants were too few for the country, and want of people and money\ngave men no temptation to enlarge their possessions of land, or contest\nfor wider extent of ground, are little more than generals of their\narmies; and though they command absolutely in war, yet at home and in\ntime of peace they exercise very little dominion, and have but a very\nmoderate sovereignty, the resolutions of peace and war being ordinarily\neither in the people, or in a council. Tho\u2019 the war itself, which admits\nnot of plurality of governors, naturally devolves the command into the\nking\u2019s sole authority.\nSect. 109. And thus in Israel itself, the chief business of their\njudges, and first kings, seems to have been to be captains in war, and\nleaders of their armies; which (besides what is signified by going out\nand in before the people, which was, to march forth to war, and home\nagain in the heads of their forces) appears plainly in the story of\nJephtha. The Ammonites making war upon Israel, the Gileadites in fear\nsend to Jephtha, a bastard of their family whom they had cast off, and\narticle with him, if he will assist them against the Ammonites, to make\nhim their ruler; which they do in these words, And the people made him\nhead and captain over them, Judg. xi, 11. which was, as it seems, all\none as to be judge. And he judged Israel, judg. xii. 7. that is, was\ntheir captain-general six years. So when Jotham upbraids the Shechemites\nwith the obligation they had to Gideon, who had been their judge and\nruler, he tells them, He fought for you, and adventured his life far,\nand delivered you out of the hands of Midian, Judg. ix. 17. Nothing\nmentioned of him but what he did as a general: and indeed that is all is\nfound in his history, or in any of the rest of the judges. And Abimelech\nparticularly is called king, though at most he was but their general.\nAnd when, being weary of the ill conduct of Samuel\u2019s sons, the children\nof Israel desired a king, like all the nations to judge them, and to go\nout before them, and to fight their battles, I. Sam viii. 20. God\ngranting their desire, says to Samuel, I will send thee a man, and thou\nshalt anoint him to be captain over my people Israel, that he may save\nmy people out of the hands of the Philistines, ix. 16. As if the only\nbusiness of a king had been to lead out their armies, and fight in their\ndefence; and accordingly at his inauguration pouring a vial of oil upon\nhim, declares to Saul, that the Lord had anointed him to be captain over\nhis inheritance, x. 1. And therefore those, who after Saul\u2019s being\nsolemnly chosen and saluted king by the tribes at Mispah, were unwilling\nto have him their king, made no other objection but this, How shall this\nman save us? v. 27. as if they should have said, this man is unfit to be\nour king, not having skill and conduct enough in war, to be able to\ndefend us. And when God resolved to transfer the government to David, it\nis in these words, But now thy kingdom shall not continue: the Lord hath\nsought him a man after his own heart, and the Lord hath commanded him to\nbe captain over his people, xiii. 14. As if the whole kingly authority\nwere nothing else but to be their general: and therefore the tribes who\nhad stuck to Saul\u2019s family, and opposed David\u2019s reign, when they came to\nHebron with terms of submission to him, they tell him, amongst other\narguments they had to submit to him as to their king, that he was in\neffect their king in Saul\u2019s time, and therefore they had no reason but\nto receive him as their king now. Also (say they) in time past, when\nSaul was king over us, thou wast he that reddest out and broughtest in\nIsrael, and the Lord said unto thee, Thou shalt feed my people Israel,\nand thou shalt be a captain over Israel.\nSect. 110. Thus, whether a family by degrees grew up into a\ncommonwealth, and the fatherly authority being continued on to the\nelder son, every one in his turn growing up under it, tacitly submitted\nto it, and the easiness and equality of it not offending any one, every\none acquiesced, till time seemed to have confirmed it, and settled a\nright of succession by prescription: or whether several families, or the\ndescendants of several families, whom chance, neighbourhood, or business\nbrought together, uniting into society, the need of a general, whose\nconduct might defend them against their enemies in war, and the great\nconfidence the innocence and sincerity of that poor but virtuous age,\n(such as are almost all those which begin governments, that ever come to\nlast in the world) gave men one of another, made the first beginners of\ncommonwealths generally put the rule into one man\u2019s hand, without any\nother express limitation or restraint, but what the nature of the thing,\nand the end of government required: which ever of those it was that at\nfirst put the rule into the hands of a single person, certain it is no\nbody was intrusted with it but for the public good and safety, and to\nthose ends, in the infancies of commonwealths, those who had it commonly\nused it. And unless they had done so, young societies could not have\nsubsisted; without such nursing fathers tender and careful of the public\nweal, all governments would have sunk under the weakness and infirmities\nof their infancy, and the prince and the people had soon perished\ntogether.\nSect. 111. But though the golden age (before vain ambition, and amor\nsceleratus habendi, evil concupiscence, had corrupted men\u2019s minds into a\nmistake of true power and honour) had more virtue, and consequently\nbetter governors, as well as less vicious subjects, and there was then\nno stretching prerogative on the one side, to oppress the people; nor\nconsequently on the other, any dispute about privilege, to lessen or\nrestrain the power of the magistrate, and so no contest betwixt rulers\nand people about governors or government: yet, when ambition and luxury\nin future ages* would retain and increase the power, without doing the\nbusiness for which it was given; and aided by flattery, taught princes\nto have distinct and separate interests from their people, men found it\nnecessary to examine more carefully the original and rights of\ngovernment; and to find out ways to restrain the exorbitances, and\nprevent the abuses of that power, which they having intrusted in\nanother\u2019s hands only for their own good, they found was made use of to\nhurt them.\n(*At first, when some certain kind of regiment was once approved, it may\nbe nothing was then farther thought upon for the manner of governing,\nbut all permitted unto their wisdom and discretion which were to rule,\ntill by experience they found this for all parts very inconvenient, so\nas the thing which they had devised for a remedy, did indeed but\nincrease the sore which it should have cured. They saw, that to live by\none man\u2019s will, became the cause of all men\u2019s misery. This constrained\nthem to come unto laws wherein all men might see their duty before hand,\nand know the penalties of transgressing them. Hooker\u2019s Eccl. Pol. l. i.\nsect. 10.)\nSect. 112. Thus we may see how probable it is, that people that were\nnaturally free, and by their own consent either submitted to the\ngovernment of their father, or united together out of different families\nto make a government, should generally put the rule into one man\u2019s\nhands, and chuse to be under the conduct of a single person, without so\nmuch as by express conditions limiting or regulating his power, which\nthey thought safe enough in his honesty and prudence; though they never\ndreamed of monarchy being lure Divino, which we never heard of among\nmankind, till it was revealed to us by the divinity of this last age;\nnor ever allowed paternal power to have a right to dominion, or to be\nthe foundation of all government. And thus much may suffice to shew,\nthat as far as we have any light from history, we have reason to\nconclude, that all peaceful beginnings of government have been laid in\nthe consent of the people. I say peaceful, because I shall have occasion\nin another place to speak of conquest, which some esteem a way of\nbeginning of governments.\nThe other objection I find urged against the beginning of polities, in\nthe way I have mentioned, is this, viz.\nSect. 113. That all men being born under government, some or other, it\nis impossible any of them should ever be free, and at liberty to unite\ntogether, and begin a new one, or ever be able to erect a lawful\ngovernment.\nIf this argument be good; I ask, how came so many lawful monarchies into\nthe world? for if any body, upon this supposition, can shew me any one\nman in any age of the world free to begin a lawful monarchy, I will be\nbound to shew him ten other free men at liberty, at the same time to\nunite and begin a new government under a regal, or any other form; it\nbeing demonstration, that if any one, born under the dominion of\nanother, may be so free as to have a right to command others in a new\nand distinct empire, every one that is born under the dominion of\nanother may be so free too, and may become a ruler, or subject, of a\ndistinct separate government. And so by this their own principle, either\nall men, however born, are free, or else there is but one lawful prince,\none lawful government in the world. And then they have nothing to do,\nbut barely to shew us which that is; which when they have done, I doubt\nnot but all mankind will easily agree to pay obedience to him.\nSect. 114. Though it be a sufficient answer to their objection, to shew\nthat it involves them in the same difficulties that it doth those they\nuse it against; yet I shall endeavour to discover the weakness of this\nargument a little farther. All men, say they, are born under government,\nand therefore they cannot be at liberty to begin a new one. Every one is\nborn a subject to his father, or his prince, and is therefore under the\nperpetual tie of subjection and allegiance. It is plain mankind never\nowned nor considered any such natural subjection that they were born in,\nto one or to the other that tied them, without their own consents, to a\nsubjection to them and their heirs.\nSect. 115. For there are no examples so frequent in history, both sacred\nand profane, as those of men withdrawing themselves, and their\nobedience, from the jurisdiction they were born under, and the family or\ncommunity they were bred up in, and setting up new governments in other\nplaces; from whence sprang all that number of petty commonwealths in the\nbeginning of ages, and which always multiplied, as long as there was\nroom enough, till the stronger, or more fortunate, swallowed the weaker;\nand those great ones again breaking to pieces, dissolved into lesser\ndominions. All which are so many testimonies against paternal\nsovereignty, and plainly prove, that it was not the natural right of the\nfather descending to his heirs, that made governments in the beginning,\nsince it was impossible, upon that ground, there should have been so\nmany little kingdoms; all must have been but only one universal\nmonarchy, if men had not been at liberty to separate themselves from\ntheir families, and the government, be it what it will, that was set up\nin it, and go and make distinct commonwealths and other governments, as\nthey thought fit.\nSect. 116. This has been the practice of the world from its first\nbeginning to this day; nor is it now any more hindrance to the freedom\nof mankind, that they are born under constituted and ancient polities,\nthat have established laws, and set forms of government, than if they\nwere born in the woods, amongst the unconfined inhabitants, that run\nloose in them: for those, who would persuade us, that by being born\nunder any government, we are naturally subjects to it, and have no more\nany title or pretence to the freedom of the state of nature, have no\nother reason (bating that of paternal power, which we have already\nanswered) to produce for it, but only, because our fathers or\nprogenitors passed away their natural liberty, and thereby bound up\nthemselves and their posterity to a perpetual subjection to the\ngovernment, which they themselves submitted to. It is true, that\nwhatever engagements or promises any one has made for himself, he is\nunder the obligation of them, but cannot, by any compact whatsoever,\nbind his children or posterity: for his son, when a man, being\naltogether as free as the father, any act of the father can no more give\naway the liberty of the son, than it can of any body else: he may indeed\nannex such conditions to the land, he enjoyed as a subject of any\ncommonwealth, as may oblige his son to be of that community, if he will\nenjoy those possessions which were his father\u2019s; because that estate\nbeing his father\u2019s property, he may dispose, or settle it, as he\npleases.\nSect. 117. And this has generally given the occasion to mistake in this\nmatter; because commonwealths not permitting any part of their dominions\nto be dismembered, nor to be enjoyed by any but those of their\ncommunity, the son cannot ordinarily enjoy the possessions of his\nfather, but under the same terms his father did, by becoming a member of\nthe society; whereby he puts himself presently under the government he\nfinds there established, as much as any other subject of that\ncommonwealth. And thus the consent of freemen, born under government,\nwhich only makes them members of it, being given separately in their\nturns, as each comes to be of age, and not in a multitude together;\npeople take no notice of it, and thinking it not done at all, or not\nnecessary, conclude they are naturally subjects as they are men.\nSect. 118. But, it is plain, governments themselves understand it\notherwise; they claim no power over the son, because of that they had\nover the father; nor look on children as being their subjects, by their\nfathers being so. If a subject of England have a child, by an English\nwoman in France, whose subject is he? Not the king of England\u2019s; for he\nmust have leave to be admitted to the privileges of it: nor the king of\nFrance\u2019s; for how then has his father a liberty to bring him away, and\nbreed him as he pleases? and who ever was judged as a traytor or\ndeserter, if he left, or warred against a country, for being barely born\nin it of parents that were aliens there? It is plain then, by the\npractice of governments themselves, as well as by the law of right\nreason, that a child is born a subject of no country or government. He\nis under his father\u2019s tuition and authority, till he comes to age of\ndiscretion; and then he is a freeman, at liberty what government he will\nput himself under, what body politic he will unite himself to: for if an\nEnglishman\u2019s son, born in France, be at liberty, and may do so, it is\nevident there is no tie upon him by his father\u2019s being a subject of this\nkingdom; nor is he bound up by any compact of his ancestors. And why\nthen hath not his son, by the same reason, the same liberty, though he\nbe born any where else? Since the power that a father hath naturally\nover his children, is the same, where-ever they be born, and the ties of\nnatural obligations, are not bounded by the positive limits of kingdoms\nand commonwealths.\nSect. 119. Every man being, as has been shewed, naturally free, and\nnothing being able to put him into subjection to any earthly power, but\nonly his own consent; it is to be considered, what shall be understood\nto be a sufficient declaration of a man\u2019s consent, to make him subject\nto the laws of any government. There is a common distinction of an\nexpress and a tacit consent, which will concern our present case. No\nbody doubts but an express consent, of any man entering into any\nsociety, makes him a perfect member of that society, a subject of that\ngovernment. The difficulty is, what ought to be looked upon as a tacit\nconsent, and how far it binds, i.e. how far any one shall be looked on\nto have consented, and thereby submitted to any government, where he has\nmade no expressions of it at all. And to this I say, that every man,\nthat hath any possessions, or enjoyment, of any part of the dominions of\nany government, doth thereby give his tacit consent, and is as far\nforth obliged to obedience to the laws of that government, during such\nenjoyment, as any one under it; whether this his possession be of land,\nto him and his heirs for ever, or a lodging only for a week; or whether\nit be barely travelling freely on the highway; and in effect, it reaches\nas far as the very being of any one within the territories of that\ngovernment.\nSect. 120. To understand this the better, it is fit to consider, that\nevery man, when he at first incorporates himself into any commonwealth,\nhe, by his uniting himself thereunto, annexed also, and submits to the\ncommunity, those possessions, which he has, or shall acquire, that do\nnot already belong to any other government: for it would be a direct\ncontradiction, for any one to enter into society with others for the\nsecuring and regulating of property; and yet to suppose his land, whose\nproperty is to be regulated by the laws of the society, should be exempt\nfrom the jurisdiction of that government, to which he himself, the\nproprietor of the land, is a subject. By the same act therefore, whereby\nany one unites his person, which was before free, to any commonwealth,\nby the same he unites his possessions, which were before free, to it\nalso; and they become, both of them, person and possession, subject to\nthe government and dominion of that commonwealth, as long as it hath a\nbeing. Whoever therefore, from thenceforth, by inheritance, purchase,\npermission, or otherways, enjoys any part of the land, so annexed to,\nand under the government of that commonwealth, must take it with the\ncondition it is under; that is, of submitting to the government of the\ncommonwealth, under whose jurisdiction it is, as far forth as any\nsubject of it.\nSect. 121. But since the government has a direct jurisdiction only over\nthe land, and reaches the possessor of it, (before he has actually\nincorporated himself in the society) only as he dwells upon, and enjoys\nthat; the obligation any one is under, by virtue of such enjoyment, to\nsubmit to the government, begins and ends with the enjoyment; so that\nwhenever the owner, who has given nothing but such a tacit consent to\nthe government, will, by donation, sale, or otherwise, quit the said\npossession, he is at liberty to go and incorporate himself into any\nother commonwealth; or to agree with others to begin a new one, in\nvacuis locis, in any part of the world, they can find free and\nunpossessed: whereas he, that has once, by actual agreement, and any\nexpress declaration, given his consent to be of any commonwealth, is\nperpetually and indispensably obliged to be, and remain unalterably a\nsubject to it, and can never be again in the liberty of the state of\nnature; unless, by any calamity, the government he was under comes to be\ndissolved; or else by some public act cuts him off from being any longer\na member of it.\nSect. 122. But submitting to the laws of any country, living quietly,\nand enjoying privileges and protection under them, makes not a man a\nmember of that society: this is only a local protection and homage due\nto and from all those, who, not being in a state of war, come within the\nterritories belonging to any government, to all parts whereof the force\nof its laws extends. But this no more makes a man a member of that\nsociety, a perpetual subject of that commonwealth, than it would make a\nman a subject to another, in whose family he found it convenient to\nabide for some time; though, whilst he continued in it, he were obliged\nto comply with the laws, and submit to the government he found there.\nAnd thus we see, that foreigners, by living all their lives under\nanother government, and enjoying the privileges and protection of it,\nthough they are bound, even in conscience, to submit to its\nadministration, as far forth as any denison; yet do not thereby come to\nbe subjects or members of that commonwealth. Nothing can make any man\nso, but his actually entering into it by positive engagement, and\nexpress promise and compact. This is that, which I think, concerning the\nbeginning of political societies, and that consent which makes any one a\nmember of any commonwealth.\nCHAPTER. IX.\nOF THE ENDS OF POLITICAL SOCIETY AND GOVERNMENT.\nSect. 123. IF man in the state of nature be so free, as has been said;\nif he be absolute lord of his own person and possessions, equal to the\ngreatest, and subject to no body, why will he part with his freedom? why\nwill he give up this empire, and subject himself to the dominion and\ncontroul of any other power? To which it is obvious to answer, that\nthough in the state of nature he hath such a right, yet the enjoyment of\nit is very uncertain, and constantly exposed to the invasion of others:\nfor all being kings as much as he, every man his equal, and the greater\npart no strict observers of equity and justice, the enjoyment of the\nproperty he has in this state is very unsafe, very unsecure. This makes\nhim willing to quit a condition, which, however free, is full of fears\nand continual dangers: and it is not without reason, that he seeks out,\nand is willing to join in society with others, who are already united,\nor have a mind to unite, for the mutual preservation of their lives,\nliberties and estates, which I call by the general name, property.\nSect. 124. The great and chief end, therefore, of men\u2019s uniting into\ncommonwealths, and putting themselves under government, is the\npreservation of their property. To which in the state of nature there\nare many things wanting.\nFirst, There wants an established, settled, known law, received and\nallowed by common consent to be the standard of right and wrong, and the\ncommon measure to decide all controversies between them: for though the\nlaw of nature be plain and intelligible to all rational creatures; yet\nmen being biassed by their interest, as well as ignorant for want of\nstudy of it, are not apt to allow of it as a law binding to them in the\napplication of it to their particular cases.\nSect. 125. Secondly, In the state of nature there wants a known and\nindifferent judge, with authority to determine all differences according\nto the established law: for every one in that state being both judge and\nexecutioner of the law of nature, men being partial to themselves,\npassion and revenge is very apt to carry them too far, and with too much\nheat, in their own cases; as well as negligence, and unconcernedness, to\nmake them too remiss in other men\u2019s.\nSect. 126. Thirdly, In the state of nature there often wants power to\nback and support the sentence when right, and to give it due execution,\nThey who by any injustice offended, will seldom fail, where they are\nable, by force to make good their injustice; such resistance many times\nmakes the punishment dangerous, and frequently destructive, to those who\nattempt it.\nSect. 127. Thus mankind, notwithstanding all the privileges of the state\nof nature, being but in an ill condition, while they remain in it, are\nquickly driven into society. Hence it comes to pass, that we seldom find\nany number of men live any time together in this state. The\ninconveniencies that they are therein exposed to, by the irregular and\nuncertain exercise of the power every man has of punishing the\ntransgressions of others, make them take sanctuary under the established\nlaws of government, and therein seek the preservation of their property.\nIt is this makes them so willingly give up every one his single power of\npunishing, to be exercised by such alone, as shall be appointed to it\namongst them; and by such rules as the community, or those authorized by\nthem to that purpose, shall agree on. And in this we have the original\nright and rise of both the legislative and executive power, as well as\nof the governments and societies themselves.\nSect. 128. For in the state of nature, to omit the liberty he has of\ninnocent delights, a man has two powers.\nThe first is to do whatsoever he thinks fit for the preservation of\nhimself, and others within the permission of the law of nature: by which\nlaw, common to them all, he and all the rest of mankind are one\ncommunity, make up one society, distinct from all other creatures. And\nwere it not for the corruption and vitiousness of degenerate men, there\nwould be no need of any other; no necessity that men should separate\nfrom this great and natural community, and by positive agreements\ncombine into smaller and divided associations.\nThe other power a man has in the state of nature, is the power to punish\nthe crimes committed against that law. Both these he gives up, when he\njoins in a private, if I may so call it, or particular politic society,\nand incorporates into any commonwealth, separate from the rest of\nmankind.\nSect. 129. The first power, viz. of doing whatsoever he thought for the\npreservation of himself, and the rest of mankind, he gives up to be\nregulated by laws made by the society, so far forth as the preservation\nof himself, and the rest of that society shall require; which laws of\nthe society in many things confine the liberty he had by the law of\nnature.\nSect. 130. Secondly, The power of punishing he wholly gives up, and\nengages his natural force, (which he might before employ in the\nexecution of the law of nature, by his own single authority, as he\nthought fit) to assist the executive power of the society, as the law\nthereof shall require: for being now in a new state, wherein he is to\nenjoy many conveniencies, from the labour, assistance, and society of\nothers in the same community, as well as protection from its whole\nstrength; he is to part also with as much of his natural liberty, in\nproviding for himself, as the good, prosperity, and safety of the\nsociety shall require; which is not only necessary, but just, since the\nother members of the society do the like.\nSect. 131. But though men, when they enter into society, give up the\nequality, liberty, and executive power they had in the state of nature,\ninto the hands of the society, to be so far disposed of by the\nlegislative, as the good of the society shall require; yet it being only\nwith an intention in every one the better to preserve himself, his\nliberty and property; (for no rational creature can be supposed to\nchange his condition with an intention to be worse) the power of the\nsociety, or legislative constituted by them, can never be supposed to\nextend farther, than the common good; but is obliged to secure every\none\u2019s property, by providing against those three defects above\nmentioned, that made the state of nature so unsafe and uneasy. And so\nwhoever has the legislative or supreme power of any commonwealth, is\nbound to govern by established standing laws, promulgated and known to\nthe people, and not by extemporary decrees; by indifferent and upright\njudges, who are to decide controversies by those laws; and to employ the\nforce of the community at home, only in the execution of such laws, or\nabroad to prevent or redress foreign injuries, and secure the community\nfrom inroads and invasion. And all this to be directed to no other end,\nbut the peace, safety, and public good of the people.\nCHAPTER. X.\nOF THE FORMS OF A COMMON-WEALTH.\nSect. 132. THE majority having, as has been shewed, upon men\u2019s first\nuniting into society, the whole power of the community naturally in\nthem, may employ all that power in making laws for the community from\ntime to time, and executing those laws by officers of their own\nappointing; and then the form of the government is a perfect democracy:\nor else may put the power of making laws into the hands of a few select\nmen, and their heirs or successors; and then it is an oligarchy: or else\ninto the hands of one man, and then it is a monarchy: if to him and his\nheirs, it is an hereditary monarchy: if to him only for life, but upon\nhis death the power only of nominating a successor to return to them; an\nelective monarchy. And so accordingly of these the community may make\ncompounded and mixed forms of government, as they think good. And if the\nlegislative power be at first given by the majority to one or more\npersons only for their lives, or any limited time, and then the supreme\npower to revert to them again; when it is so reverted, the community may\ndispose of it again anew into what hands they please, and so constitute\na new form of government: for the form of government depending upon the\nplacing the supreme power, which is the legislative, it being impossible\nto conceive that an inferior power should prescribe to a superior, or\nany but the supreme make laws, according as the power of making laws is\nplaced, such is the form of the commonwealth.\nSect. 133. By commonwealth, I must be understood all along to mean, not\na democracy, or any form of government, but any independent community,\nwhich the Latines signified by the word civitas, to which the word which\nbest answers in our language, is commonwealth, and most properly\nexpresses such a society of men, which community or city in English does\nnot; for there may be subordinate communities in a government; and city\namongst us has a quite different notion from commonwealth: and\ntherefore, to avoid ambiguity, I crave leave to use the word\ncommonwealth in that sense, in which I find it used by king James the\nfirst; and I take it to be its genuine signification; which if any body\ndislike, I consent with him to change it for a better.\nCHAPTER. XI.\nOF THE EXTENT OF THE LEGISLATIVE POWER.\nSect. 134. THE great end of men\u2019s entering into society, being the\nenjoyment of their properties in peace and safety, and the great\ninstrument and means of that being the laws established in that society;\nthe first and fundamental positive law of all commonwealths is the\nestablishing of the legislative power; as the first and fundamental\nnatural law, which is to govern even the legislative itself, is the\npreservation of the society, and (as far as will consist with the public\ngood) of every person in it. This legislative is not only the supreme\npower of the commonwealth, but sacred and unalterable in the hands\nwhere the community have once placed it; nor can any edict of any body\nelse, in what form soever conceived, or by what power soever backed,\nhave the force and obligation of a law, which has not its sanction from\nthat legislative which the public has chosen and appointed: for without\nthis the law could not have that, which is absolutely necessary to its\nbeing a law,* the consent of the society, over whom no body can have a\npower to make laws, but by their own consent, and by authority received\nfrom them; and therefore all the obedience, which by the most solemn\nties any one can be obliged to pay, ultimately terminates in this\nsupreme power, and is directed by those laws which it enacts: nor can\nany oaths to any foreign power whatsoever, or any domestic subordinate\npower, discharge any member of the society from his obedience to the\nlegislative, acting pursuant to their trust; nor oblige him to any\nobedience contrary to the laws so enacted, or farther than they do\nallow; it being ridiculous to imagine one can be tied ultimately to obey\nany power in the society, which is not the supreme.\n(*The lawful power of making laws to command whole politic societies of\nmen, belonging so properly unto the same intire societies, that for any\nprince or potentate of what kind soever upon earth, to exercise the same\nof himself, and not by express commission immediately and personally\nreceived from God, or else by authority derived at the first from their\nconsent, upon whose persons they impose laws, it is no better than mere\ntyranny. Laws they are not therefore which public approbation hath not\nmade so. Hooker\u2019s Eccl. Pol. l. i. sect. 10.\nOf this point therefore we are to note, that such men naturally have no\nfull and perfect power to command whole politic multitudes of men,\ntherefore utterly without our consent, we could in such sort be at no\nman\u2019s commandment living. And to be commanded we do consent, when that\nsociety, whereof we be a part, hath at any time before consented,\nwithout revoking the same after by the like universal agreement. Laws\ntherefore human, of what kind so ever, are available by consent. Ibid.)\nSect. 135. Though the legislative, whether placed in one or more,\nwhether it be always in being, or only by intervals, though it be the\nsupreme power in every commonwealth; yet:\nFirst, It is not, nor can possibly be absolutely arbitrary over the\nlives and fortunes of the people: for it being but the joint power of\nevery member of the society given up to that person, or assembly, which\nis legislator; it can be no more than those persons had in a state of\nnature before they entered into society, and gave up to the community:\nfor no body can transfer to another more power than he has in himself;\nand no body has an absolute arbitrary power over himself, or over any\nother, to destroy his own life, or take away the life or property of\nanother. A man, as has been proved, cannot subject himself to the\narbitrary power of another; and having in the state of nature no\narbitrary power over the life, liberty, or possession of another, but\nonly so much as the law of nature gave him for the preservation of\nhimself, and the rest of mankind; this is all he doth, or can give up\nto the commonwealth, and by it to the legislative power, so that the\nlegislative can have no more than this. Their power, in the utmost\nbounds of it, is limited to the public good of the society. It is a\npower, that hath no other end but preservation, and therefore can never\nhave a right to destroy, enslave, or designedly to impoverish the\nsubjects.* The obligations of the law of nature cease not in society,\nbut only in many cases are drawn closer, and have by human laws known\npenalties annexed to them, to inforce their observation. Thus the law of\nnature stands as an eternal rule to all men, legislators as well as\nothers. The rules that they make for other men\u2019s actions, must, as well\nas their own and other men\u2019s actions, be conformable to the law of\nnature, i.e. to the will of God, of which that is a declaration, and the\nfundamental law of nature being the preservation of mankind, no human\nsanction can be good, or valid against it.\n(*Two foundations there are which bear up public societies; the one a\nnatural inclination, whereby all men desire sociable life and\nfellowship; the other an order, expresly or secretly agreed upon,\ntouching the manner of their union in living together: the latter is\nthat which we call the law of a common-weal, the very soul of a politic\nbody, the parts whereof are by law animated, held together, and set on\nwork in such actions as the common good requireth. Laws politic,\nordained for external order and regiment amongst men, are never framed\nas they should be, unless presuming the will of man to be inwardly\nobstinate, rebellious, and averse from all obedience to the sacred laws\nof his nature; in a word, unless presuming man to be, in regard of his\ndepraved mind, little better than a wild beast, they do accordingly\nprovide, notwithstanding, so to frame his outward actions, that they be\nno hindrance unto the common good, for which societies are instituted.\nUnless they do this, they are not perfect. Hooker\u2019s Eccl. Pol. l. i.\nsect. 10.)\nSect. 136. Secondly, The legislative, or supreme authority, cannot\nassume to its self a power to rule by extemporary arbitrary decrees, but\nis bound to dispense justice, and decide the rights of the subject by\npromulgated standing laws, and known authorized judges:* for the law of\nnature being unwritten, and so no where to be found but in the minds of\nmen, they who through passion or interest shall miscite, or misapply it,\ncannot so easily be convinced of their mistake where there is no\nestablished judge: and so it serves not, as it ought, to determine the\nrights, and fence the properties of those that live under it, especially\nwhere every one is judge, interpreter, and executioner of it too, and\nthat in his own case: and he that has right on his side, having\nordinarily but his own single strength, hath not force enough to defend\nhimself from injuries, or to punish delinquents. To avoid these\ninconveniences, which disorder men\u2019s propperties in the state of nature,\nmen unite into societies, that they may have the united strength of the\nwhole society to secure and defend their properties, and may have\nstanding rules to bound it, by which every one may know what is his. To\nthis end it is that men give up all their natural power to the society\nwhich they enter into, and the community put the legislative power into\nsuch hands as they think fit, with this trust, that they shall be\ngoverned by declared laws, or else their peace, quiet, and property will\nstill be at the same uncertainty, as it was in the state of nature.\n(*Human laws are measures in respect of men whose actions they must\ndirect, howbeit such measures they are as have also their higher rules\nto be measured by, which rules are two, the law of God, and the law of\nnature; so that laws human must be made according to the general laws of\nnature, and without contradiction to any positive law of scripture,\notherwise they are ill made. Hooker\u2019s Eccl. Pol. l. iii. sect. 9.\nTo constrain men to any thing inconvenient doth seem unreasonable.\nIbid. l. i. sect. 10.)\nSect. 137. Absolute arbitrary power, or governing without settled\nstanding laws, can neither of them consist with the ends of society and\ngovernment, which men would not quit the freedom of the state of nature\nfor, and tie themselves up under, were it not to preserve their lives,\nliberties and fortunes, and by stated rules of right and property to\nsecure their peace and quiet. It cannot be supposed that they should\nintend, had they a power so to do, to give to any one, or more, an\nabsolute arbitrary power over their persons and estates, and put a force\ninto the magistrate\u2019s hand to execute his unlimited will arbitrarily\nupon them. This were to put themselves into a worse condition than the\nstate of nature, wherein they had a liberty to defend their right\nagainst the injuries of others, and were upon equal terms of force to\nmaintain it, whether invaded by a single man, or many in combination.\nWhereas by supposing they have given up themselves to the absolute\narbitrary power and will of a legislator, they have disarmed themselves,\nand armed him, to make a prey of them when he pleases; he being in a\nmuch worse condition, who is exposed to the arbitrary power of one man,\nwho has the command of 100,000, than he that is exposed to the arbitrary\npower of 100,000 single men; no body being secure, that his will, who\nhas such a command, is better than that of other men, though his force\nbe 100,000 times stronger. And therefore, whatever form the\ncommonwealth is under, the ruling power ought to govern by declared and\nreceived laws, and not by extemporary dictates and undetermined\nresolutions: for then mankind will be in a far worse condition than in\nthe state of nature, if they shall have armed one, or a few men with the\njoint power of a multitude, to force them to obey at pleasure the\nexorbitant and unlimited decrees of their sudden thoughts, or\nunrestrained, and till that moment unknown wills, without having any\nmeasures set down which may guide and justify their actions: for all the\npower the government has, being only for the good of the society, as it\nought not to be arbitrary and at pleasure, so it ought to be exercised\nby established and promulgated laws; that both the people may know their\nduty, and be safe and secure within the limits of the law; and the\nrulers too kept within their bounds, and not be tempted, by the power\nthey have in their hands, to employ it to such purposes, and by such\nmeasures, as they would not have known, and own not willingly.\nSect. 138. Thirdly, The supreme power cannot take from any man any part\nof his property without his own consent: for the preservation of\nproperty being the end of government, and that for which men enter into\nsociety, it necessarily supposes and requires, that the people should\nhave property, without which they must be supposed to lose that, by\nentering into society, which was the end for which they entered into it;\ntoo gross an absurdity for any man to own. Men therefore in society\nhaving property, they have such a right to the goods, which by the law\nof the community are their\u2019s, that no body hath a right to take their\nsubstance or any part of it from them, without their own consent:\nwithout this they have no property at all; for I have truly no property\nin that, which another can by right take from me, when he pleases,\nagainst my consent. Hence it is a mistake to think, that the supreme or\nlegislative power of any commonwealth, can do what it will, and dispose\nof the estates of the subject arbitrarily, or take any part of them at\npleasure. This is not much to be feared in governments where the\nlegislative consists, wholly or in part, in assemblies which are\nvariable, whose members, upon the dissolution of the assembly, are\nsubjects under the common laws of their country, equally with the rest.\nBut in governments, where the legislative is in one lasting assembly\nalways in being, or in one man, as in absolute monarchies, there is\ndanger still, that they will think themselves to have a distinct\ninterest from the rest of the community; and so will be apt to increase\ntheir own riches and power, by taking what they think fit from the\npeople: for a man\u2019s property is not at all secure, tho\u2019 there be good\nand equitable laws to set the bounds of it between him and his fellow\nsubjects, if he who commands those subjects have power to take from any\nprivate man, what part he pleases of his property, and use and dispose\nof it as he thinks good.\nSect. 139. But government, into whatsoever hands it is put, being, as I\nhave before shewed, intrusted with this condition, and for this end,\nthat men might have and secure their properties; the prince, or senate,\nhowever it may have power to make laws, for the regulating of property\nbetween the subjects one amongst another, yet can never have a power to\ntake to themselves the whole, or any part of the subjects property,\nwithout their own consent: for this would be in effect to leave them no\nproperty at all. And to let us see, that even absolute power, where it\nis necessary, is not arbitrary by being absolute, but is still limited\nby that reason, and confined to those ends, which required it in some\ncases to be absolute, we need look no farther than the common practice\nof martial discipline: for the preservation of the army, and in it of\nthe whole commonwealth, requires an absolute obedience to the command\nof every superior officer, and it is justly death to disobey or dispute\nthe most dangerous or unreasonable of them; but yet we see, that neither\nthe serjeant, that could command a soldier to march up to the mouth of a\ncannon, or stand in a breach, where he is almost sure to perish, can\ncommand that soldier to give him one penny of his money; nor the\ngeneral, that can condemn him to death for deserting his post, or for\nnot obeying the most desperate orders, can yet, with all his absolute\npower of life and death, dispose of one farthing of that soldier\u2019s\nestate, or seize one jot of his goods; whom yet he can command any\nthing, and hang for the least disobedience; because such a blind\nobedience is necessary to that end, for which the commander has his\npower, viz. the preservation of the rest; but the disposing of his goods\nhas nothing to do with it.\nSect. 140. It is true, governments cannot be supported without great\ncharge, and it is fit every one who enjoys his share of the protection,\nshould pay out of his estate his proportion for the maintenance of it.\nBut still it must be with his own consent, i.e. the consent of the\nmajority, giving it either by themselves, or their representatives\nchosen by them: for if any one shall claim a power to lay and levy taxes\non the people, by his own authority, and without such consent of the\npeople, he thereby invades the fundamental law of property, and subverts\nthe end of government: for what property have I in that, which another\nmay by right take, when he pleases, to himself?\nSect. 141. Fourthly, The legislative cannot transfer the power of making\nlaws to any other hands: for it being but a delegated power from the\npeople, they who have it cannot pass it over to others. The people alone\ncan appoint the form of the commonwealth, which is by constituting the\nlegislative, and appointing in whose hands that shall be. And when the\npeople have said, We will submit to rules, and be governed by laws made\nby such men, and in such forms, no body else can say other men shall\nmake laws for them; nor can the people be bound by any laws, but such as\nare enacted by those whom they have chosen, and authorized to make laws\nfor them. The power of the legislative, being derived from the people by\na positive voluntary grant and institution, can be no other than what\nthat positive grant conveyed, which being only to make laws, and not to\nmake legislators, the legislative can have no power to transfer their\nauthority of making laws, and place it in other hands.\nSect. 142. These are the bounds which the trust, that is put in them by\nthe society, and the law of God and nature, have set to the legislative\npower of every commonwealth, in all forms of government.\nFirst, They are to govern by promulgated established laws, not to be\nvaried in particular cases, but to have one rule for rich and poor, for\nthe favourite at court, and the country man at plough.\nSecondly, These laws also ought to be designed for no other end\nultimately, but the good of the people.\nThirdly, They must not raise taxes on the property of the people,\nwithout the consent of the people, given by themselves, or their\ndeputies. And this properly concerns only such governments where the\nlegislative is always in being, or at least where the people have not\nreserved any part of the legislative to deputies, to be from time to\ntime chosen by themselves.\nFourthly, The legislative neither must nor can transfer the power of\nmaking laws to any body else, or place it any where, but where the\npeople have.\nCHAPTER. XII.\nOF THE LEGISLATIVE, EXECUTIVE, AND FEDERATIVE POWER OF THE\nCOMMON-WEALTH.\nSect. 143. THE legislative power is that, which has a right to direct\nhow the force of the commonwealth shall be employed for preserving the\ncommunity and the members of it. But because those laws which are\nconstantly to be executed, and whose force is always to continue, may be\nmade in a little time; therefore there is no need, that the legislative\nshould be always in being, not having always business to do. And because\nit may be too great a temptation to human frailty, apt to grasp at\npower, for the same persons, who have the power of making laws, to have\nalso in their hands the power to execute them, whereby they may exempt\nthemselves from obedience to the laws they make, and suit the law, both\nin its making, and execution, to their own private advantage, and\nthereby come to have a distinct interest from the rest of the community,\ncontrary to the end of society and government: therefore in wellordered\ncommonwealths, where the good of the whole is so considered, as it\nought, the legislative power is put into the hands of divers persons,\nwho duly assembled, have by themselves, or jointly with others, a power\nto make laws, which when they have done, being separated again, they are\nthemselves subject to the laws they have made; which is a new and near\ntie upon them, to take care, that they make them for the public good.\nSect. 144. But because the laws, that are at once, and in a short time\nmade, have a constant and lasting force, and need a perpetual execution,\nor an attendance thereunto; therefore it is necessary there should be a\npower always in being, which should see to the execution of the laws\nthat are made, and remain in force. And thus the legislative and\nexecutive power come often to be separated.\nSect. 145. There is another power in every commonwealth, which one may\ncall natural, because it is that which answers to the power every man\nnaturally had before he entered into society: for though in a\ncommonwealth the members of it are distinct persons still in reference\nto one another, and as such as governed by the laws of the society; yet\nin reference to the rest of mankind, they make one body, which is, as\nevery member of it before was, still in the state of nature with the\nrest of mankind. Hence it is, that the controversies that happen between\nany man of the society with those that are out of it, are managed by the\npublic; and an injury done to a member of their body, engages the whole\nin the reparation of it. So that under this consideration, the whole\ncommunity is one body in the state of nature, in respect of all other\nstates or persons out of its community.\nSect. 146. This therefore contains the power of war and peace, leagues\nand alliances, and all the transactions, with all persons and\ncommunities without the commonwealth, and may be called federative, if\nany one pleases. So the thing be understood, I am indifferent as to the\nname.\nSect. 147. These two powers, executive and federative, though they be\nreally distinct in themselves, yet one comprehending the execution of\nthe municipal laws of the society within its self, upon all that are\nparts of it; the other the management of the security and interest of\nthe public without, with all those that it may receive benefit or damage\nfrom, yet they are always almost united. And though this federative\npower in the well or ill management of it be of great moment to the\ncommonwealth, yet it is much less capable to be directed by antecedent,\nstanding, positive laws, than the executive; and so must necessarily be\nleft to the prudence and wisdom of those, whose hands it is in, to be\nmanaged for the public good: for the laws that concern subjects one\namongst another, being to direct their actions, may well enough precede\nthem. But what is to be done in reference to foreigners, depending much\nupon their actions, and the variation of designs and interests, must be\nleft in great part to the prudence of those, who have this power\ncommitted to them, to be managed by the best of their skill, for the\nadvantage of the commonwealth.\nSect. 148. Though, as I said, the executive and federative power of\nevery community be really distinct in themselves, yet they are hardly to\nbe separated, and placed at the same time, in the hands of distinct\npersons: for both of them requiring the force of the society for their\nexercise, it is almost impracticable to place the force of the\ncommonwealth in distinct, and not subordinate hands; or that the\nexecutive and federative power should be placed in persons, that might\nact separately, whereby the force of the public would be under different\ncommands: which would be apt some time or other to cause disorder and\nruin.\nCHAPTER. XIII.\nOF THE SUBORDINATION OF THE POWERS OF THE COMMON-WEALTH.\nSect. 149. THOUGH in a constituted commonwealth, standing upon its own\nbasis, and acting according to its own nature, that is, acting for the\npreservation of the community, there can be but one supreme power, which\nis the legislative, to which all the rest are and must be subordinate,\nyet the legislative being only a fiduciary power to act for certain\nends, there remains still in the people a supreme power to remove or\nalter the legislative, when they find the legislative act contrary to\nthe trust reposed in them: for all power given with trust for the\nattaining an end, being limited by that end, whenever that end is\nmanifestly neglected, or opposed, the trust must necessarily be\nforfeited, and the power devolve into the hands of those that gave it,\nwho may place it anew where they shall think best for their safety and\nsecurity. And thus the community perpetually retains a supreme power of\nsaving themselves from the attempts and designs of any body, even of\ntheir legislators, whenever they shall be so foolish, or so wicked, as\nto lay and carry on designs against the liberties and properties of the\nsubject: for no man or society of men, having a power to deliver up\ntheir preservation, or consequently the means of it, to the absolute\nwill and arbitrary dominion of another; when ever any one shall go about\nto bring them into such a slavish condition, they will always have a\nright to preserve, what they have not a power to part with; and to rid\nthemselves of those, who invade this fundamental, sacred, and\nunalterable law of self-preservation, for which they entered into\nsociety. And thus the community may be said in this respect to be always\nthe supreme power, but not as considered under any form of government,\nbecause this power of the people can never take place till the\ngovernment be dissolved.\nSect. 150. In all cases, whilst the government subsists, the legislative\nis the supreme power: for what can give laws to another, must needs be\nsuperior to him; and since the legislative is no otherwise legislative\nof the society, but by the right it has to make laws for all the parts,\nand for every member of the society, prescribing rules to their actions,\nand giving power of execution, where they are transgressed, the\nlegislative must needs be the supreme, and all other powers, in any\nmembers or parts of the society, derived from and subordinate to it.\nSect. 151. In some commonwealths, where the legislative is not always in\nbeing, and the executive is vested in a single person, who has also a\nshare in the legislative; there that single person in a very tolerable\nsense may also be called supreme: not that he has in himself all the\nsupreme power, which is that of law-making; but because he has in him\nthe supreme execution, from whom all inferior magistrates derive all\ntheir several subordinate powers, or at least the greatest part of them:\nhaving also no legislative superior to him, there being no law to be\nmade without his consent, which cannot be expected should ever subject\nhim to the other part of the legislative, he is properly enough in this\nsense supreme. But yet it is to be observed, that tho\u2019 oaths of\nallegiance and fealty are taken to him, it is not to him as supreme\nlegislator, but as supreme executor of the law, made by a joint power of\nhim with others; allegiance being nothing but an obedience according to\nlaw, which when he violates, he has no right to obedience, nor can claim\nit otherwise than as the public person vested with the power of the law,\nand so is to be considered as the image, phantom, or representative of\nthe commonwealth, acted by the will of the society, declared in its\nlaws; and thus he has no will, no power, but that of the law. But when\nhe quits this representation, this public will, and acts by his own\nprivate will, he degrades himself, and is but a single private person\nwithout power, and without will, that has any right to obedience; the\nmembers owing no obedience but to the public will of the society.\nSect. 152. The executive power, placed any where but in a person that\nhas also a share in the legislative, is visibly subordinate and\naccountable to it, and may be at pleasure changed and displaced; so that\nit is not the supreme executive power, that is exempt from\nsubordination, but the supreme executive power vested in one, who having\na share in the legislative, has no distinct superior legislative to be\nsubordinate and accountable to, farther than he himself shall join and\nconsent; so that he is no more subordinate than he himself shall think\nfit, which one may certainly conclude will be but very little. Of other\nministerial and subordinate powers in a commonwealth, we need not speak,\nthey being so multiplied with infinite variety, in the different customs\nand constitutions of distinct commonwealths, that it is impossible to\ngive a particular account of them all. Only thus much, which is\nnecessary to our present purpose, we may take notice of concerning them,\nthat they have no manner of authority, any of them, beyond what is by\npositive grant and commission delegated to them, and are all of them\naccountable to some other power in the commonwealth.\nSect. 153. It is not necessary, no, nor so much as convenient, that the\nlegislative should be always in being; but absolutely necessary that the\nexecutive power should, because there is not always need of new laws to\nbe made, but always need of execution of the laws that are made. When\nthe legislative hath put the execution of the laws, they make, into\nother hands, they have a power still to resume it out of those hands,\nwhen they find cause, and to punish for any maladministration against\nthe laws. The same holds also in regard of the federative power, that\nand the executive being both ministerial and subordinate to the\nlegislative, which, as has been shewed, in a constituted commonwealth\nis the supreme. The legislative also in this case being supposed to\nconsist of several persons, (for if it be a single person, it cannot but\nbe always in being, and so will, as supreme, naturally have the supreme\nexecutive power, together with the legislative) may assemble, and\nexercise their legislature, at the times that either their original\nconstitution, or their own adjournment, appoints, or when they please;\nif neither of these hath appointed any time, or there be no other way\nprescribed to convoke them: for the supreme power being placed in them\nby the people, it is always in them, and they may exercise it when they\nplease, unless by their original constitution they are limited to\ncertain seasons, or by an act of their supreme power they have adjourned\nto a certain time; and when that time comes, they have a right to\nassemble and act again.\nSect. 154. If the legislative, or any part of it, be made up of\nrepresentatives chosen for that time by the people, which afterwards\nreturn into the ordinary state of subjects, and have no share in the\nlegislature but upon a new choice, this power of chusing must also be\nexercised by the people, either at certain appointed seasons, or else\nwhen they are summoned to it; and in this latter case the power of\nconvoking the legislative is ordinarily placed in the executive, and has\none of these two limitations in respect of time: that either the\noriginal constitution requires their assembling and acting at certain\nintervals, and then the executive power does nothing but ministerially\nissue directions for their electing and assembling, according to due\nforms; or else it is left to his prudence to call them by new elections,\nwhen the occasions or exigencies of the public require the amendment of\nold, or making of new laws, or the redress or prevention of any\ninconveniencies, that lie on, or threaten the people.\nSect. 155. It may be demanded here, What if the executive power, being\npossessed of the force of the commonwealth, shall make use of that\nforce to hinder the meeting and acting of the legislative, when the\noriginal constitution, or the public exigencies require it? I say, using\nforce upon the people without authority, and contrary to the trust put\nin him that does so, is a state of war with the people, who have a right\nto reinstate their legislative in the exercise of their power: for\nhaving erected a legislative, with an intent they should exercise the\npower of making laws, either at certain set times, or when there is need\nof it, when they are hindered by any force from what is so necessary to\nthe society, and wherein the safety and preservation of the people\nconsists, the people have a right to remove it by force. In all states\nand conditions, the true remedy of force without authority, is to oppose\nforce to it. The use of force without authority, always puts him that\nuses it into a state of war, as the aggressor, and renders him liable to\nbe treated accordingly.\nSect. 156. The power of assembling and dismissing the legislative,\nplaced in the executive, gives not the executive a superiority over it,\nbut is a fiduciary trust placed in him, for the safety of the people, in\na case where the uncertainty and variableness of human affairs could not\nbear a steady fixed rule: for it not being possible, that the first\nframers of the government should, by any foresight, be so much masters\nof future events, as to be able to prefix so just periods of return and\nduration to the assemblies of the legislative, in all times to come,\nthat might exactly answer all the exigencies of the commonwealth; the\nbest remedy could be found for this defect, was to trust this to the\nprudence of one who was always to be present, and whose business it was\nto watch over the public good. Constant frequent meetings of the\nlegislative, and long continuations of their assemblies, without\nnecessary occasion, could not but be burdensome to the people, and must\nnecessarily in time produce more dangerous inconveniencies, and yet the\nquick turn of affairs might be sometimes such as to need their present\nhelp: any delay of their convening might endanger the public; and\nsometimes too their business might be so great, that the limited time of\ntheir sitting might be too short for their work, and rob the public of\nthat benefit which could be had only from their mature deliberation.\nWhat then could be done in this case to prevent the community from being\nexposed some time or other to eminent hazard, on one side or the other,\nby fixed intervals and periods, set to the meeting and acting of the\nlegislative, but to intrust it to the prudence of some, who being\npresent, and acquainted with the state of public affairs, might make use\nof this prerogative for the public good? and where else could this be so\nwell placed as in his hands, who was intrusted with the execution of the\nlaws for the same end? Thus supposing the regulation of times for the\nassembling and sitting of the legislative, not settled by the original\nconstitution, it naturally fell into the hands of the executive, not as\nan arbitrary power depending on his good pleasure, but with this trust\nalways to have it exercised only for the public weal, as the occurrences\nof times and change of affairs might require. Whether settled periods of\ntheir convening, or a liberty left to the prince for convoking the\nlegislative, or perhaps a mixture of both, hath the least inconvenience\nattending it, it is not my business here to inquire, but only to shew,\nthat though the executive power may have the prerogative of convoking\nand dissolving such conventions of the legislative, yet it is not\nthereby superior to it.\nSect. 157. Things of this world are in so constant a flux, that nothing\nremains long in the same state. Thus people, riches, trade, power,\nchange their stations, flourishing mighty cities come to ruin, and prove\nin times neglected desolate corners, whilst other unfrequented places\ngrow into populous countries, filled with wealth and inhabitants. But\nthings not always changing equally, and private interest often keeping\nup customs and privileges, when the reasons of them are ceased, it often\ncomes to pass, that in governments, where part of the legislative\nconsists of representatives chosen by the people, that in tract of time\nthis representation becomes very unequal and disproportionate to the\nreasons it was at first established upon. To what gross absurdities the\nfollowing of custom, when reason has left it, may lead, we may be\nsatisfied, when we see the bare name of a town, of which there remains\nnot so much as the ruins, where scarce so much housing as a sheepcote,\nor more inhabitants than a shepherd is to be found, sends as many\nrepresentatives to the grand assembly of law-makers, as a whole county\nnumerous in people, and powerful in riches. This strangers stand amazed\nat, and every one must confess needs a remedy; tho\u2019 most think it hard\nto find one, because the constitution of the legislative being the\noriginal and supreme act of the society, antecedent to all positive laws\nin it, and depending wholly on the people, no inferior power can alter\nit. And therefore the people, when the legislative is once constituted,\nhaving, in such a government as we have been speaking of, no power to\nact as long as the government stands; this inconvenience is thought\nincapable of a remedy.\nSect. 158. Salus populi suprema lex, is certainly so just and\nfundamental a rule, that he, who sincerely follows it, cannot\ndangerously err. If therefore the executive, who has the power of\nconvoking the legislative, observing rather the true proportion, than\nfashion of representation, regulates, not by old custom, but true\nreason, the number of members, in all places that have a right to be\ndistinctly represented, which no part of the people however incorporated\ncan pretend to, but in proportion to the assistance which it affords to\nthe public, it cannot be judged to have set up a new legislative, but to\nhave restored the old and true one, and to have rectified the disorders\nwhich succession of time had insensibly, as well as inevitably\nintroduced: For it being the interest as well as intention of the\npeople, to have a fair and equal representative; whoever brings it\nnearest to that, is an undoubted friend to, and establisher of the\ngovernment, and cannot miss the consent and approbation of the\ncommunity; prerogative being nothing but a power, in the hands of the\nprince, to provide for the public good, in such cases, which depending\nupon unforeseen and uncertain occurrences, certain and unalterable laws\ncould not safely direct; whatsoever shall be done manifestly for the\ngood of the people, and the establishing the government upon its true\nfoundations, is, and always will be, just prerogative, The power of\nerecting new corporations, and therewith new representatives, carries\nwith it a supposition, that in time the measures of representation might\nvary, and those places have a just right to be represented which before\nhad none; and by the same reason, those cease to have a right, and be\ntoo inconsiderable for such a privilege, which before had it. \u2019Tis not a\nchange from the present state, which perhaps corruption or decay has\nintroduced, that makes an inroad upon the government, but the tendency\nof it to injure or oppress the people, and to set up one part or party,\nwith a distinction from, and an unequal subjection of the rest.\nWhatsoever cannot but be acknowledged to be of advantage to the society,\nand people in general, upon just and lasting measures, will always, when\ndone, justify itself; and whenever the people shall chuse their\nrepresentatives upon just and undeniably equal measures, suitable to the\noriginal frame of the government, it cannot be doubted to be the will\nand act of the society, whoever permitted or caused them so to do.\nCHAPTER. XIV.\nOF PREROGATIVE.\nSect. 159. WHERE the legislative and executive power are in distinct\nhands, (as they are in all moderated monarchies, and well-framed\ngovernments) there the good of the society requires, that several things\nshould be left to the discretion of him that has the executive power:\nfor the legislators not being able to foresee, and provide by laws, for\nall that may be useful to the community, the executor of the laws having\nthe power in his hands, has by the common law of nature a right to make\nuse of it for the good of the society, in many cases, where the\nmunicipal law has given no direction, till the legislative can\nconveniently be assembled to provide for it. Many things there are,\nwhich the law can by no means provide for; and those must necessarily be\nleft to the discretion of him that has the executive power in his hands,\nto be ordered by him as the public good and advantage shall require:\nnay, it is fit that the laws themselves should in some cases give way to\nthe executive power, or rather to this fundamental law of nature and\ngovernment, viz. That as much as may be, all the members of the society\nare to be preserved: for since many accidents may happen, wherein a\nstrict and rigid observation of the laws may do harm; (as not to pull\ndown an innocent man\u2019s house to stop the fire, when the next to it is\nburning) and a man may come sometimes within the reach of the law, which\nmakes no distinction of persons, by an action that may deserve reward\nand pardon; \u2019tis fit the ruler should have a power, in many cases, to\nmitigate the severity of the law, and pardon some offenders: for the end\nof government being the preservation of all, as much as may be, even the\nguilty are to be spared, where it can prove no prejudice to the\ninnocent.\nSect. 160. This power to act according to discretion, for the public\ngood, without the prescription of the law, and sometimes even against\nit, is that which is called prerogative: for since in some governments\nthe lawmaking power is not always in being, and is usually too numerous,\nand so too slow, for the dispatch requisite to execution; and because\nalso it is impossible to foresee, and so by laws to provide for, all\naccidents and necessities that may concern the public, or to make such\nlaws as will do no harm, if they are executed with an inflexible rigour,\non all occasions, and upon all persons that may come in their way;\ntherefore there is a latitude left to the executive power, to do many\nthings of choice which the laws do not prescribe.\nSect. 161. This power, whilst employed for the benefit of the community,\nand suitably to the trust and ends of the government, is undoubted\nprerogative, and never is questioned: for the people are very seldom or\nnever scrupulous or nice in the point; they are far from examining\nprerogative, whilst it is in any tolerable degree employed for the use\nit was meant, that is, for the good of the people, and not manifestly\nagainst it: but if there comes to be a question between the executive\npower and the people, about a thing claimed as a prerogative; the\ntendency of the exercise of such prerogative to the good or hurt of the\npeople, will easily decide that question.\nSect. 162. It is easy to conceive, that in the infancy of governments,\nwhen commonwealths differed little from families in number of people,\nthey differed from them too but little in number of laws: and the\ngovernors, being as the fathers of them, watching over them for their\ngood, the government was almost all prerogative. A few established laws\nserved the turn, and the discretion and care of the ruler supplied the\nrest. But when mistake or flattery prevailed with weak princes to make\nuse of this power for private ends of their own, and not for the public\ngood, the people were fain by express laws to get prerogative determined\nin those points wherein they found disadvantage from it: and thus\ndeclared limitations of prerogative were by the people found necessary\nin cases which they and their ancestors had left, in the utmost\nlatitude, to the wisdom of those princes who made no other but a right\nuse of it, that is, for the good of their people.\nSect. 163. And therefore they have a very wrong notion of government,\nwho say, that the people have encroached upon the prerogative, when they\nhave got any part of it to be defined by positive laws: for in so doing\nthey have not pulled from the prince any thing that of right belonged to\nhim, but only declared, that that power which they indefinitely left in\nhis or his ancestors hands, to be exercised for their good, was not a\nthing which they intended him when he used it otherwise: for the end of\ngovernment being the good of the community, whatsoever alterations are\nmade in it, tending to that end, cannot be an encroachment upon any\nbody, since no body in government can have a right tending to any other\nend: and those only are encroachments which prejudice or hinder the\npublic good. Those who say otherwise, speak as if the prince had a\ndistinct and separate interest from the good of the community, and was\nnot made for it; the root and source from which spring almost all those\nevils and disorders which happen in kingly governments. And indeed, if\nthat be so, the people under his government are not a society of\nrational creatures, entered into a community for their mutual good; they\nare not such as have set rulers over themselves, to guard, and promote\nthat good; but are to be looked on as an herd of inferior creatures\nunder the dominion of a master, who keeps them and works them for his\nown pleasure or profit. If men were so void of reason, and brutish, as\nto enter into society upon such terms, prerogative might indeed be, what\nsome men would have it, an arbitrary power to do things hurtful to the\npeople.\nSect. 164. But since a rational creature cannot be supposed, when free,\nto put himself into subjection to another, for his own harm; (though,\nwhere he finds a good and wise ruler, he may not perhaps think it either\nnecessary or useful to set precise bounds to his power in all things)\nprerogative can be nothing but the people\u2019s permitting their rulers to\ndo several things, of their own free choice, where the law was silent,\nand sometimes too against the direct letter of the law, for the public\ngood; and their acquiescing in it when so done: for as a good prince,\nwho is mindful of the trust put into his hands, and careful of the good\nof his people, cannot have too much prerogative, that is, power to do\ngood; so a weak and ill prince, who would claim that power which his\npredecessors exercised without the direction of the law, as a\nprerogative belonging to him by right of his office, which he may\nexercise at his pleasure, to make or promote an interest distinct from\nthat of the public, gives the people an occasion to claim their right,\nand limit that power, which, whilst it was exercised for their good,\nthey were content should be tacitly allowed.\nSect. 165. And therefore he that will look into the history of England,\nwill find, that prerogative was always largest in the hands of our\nwisest and best princes; because the people, observing the whole\ntendency of their actions to be the public good, contested not what was\ndone without law to that end: or, if any human frailty or mistake (for\nprinces are but men, made as others) appeared in some small declinations\nfrom that end; yet \u2019twas visible, the main of their conduct tended to\nnothing but the care of the public. The people therefore, finding reason\nto be satisfied with these princes, whenever they acted without, or\ncontrary to the letter of the law, acquiesced in what they did, and,\nwithout the least complaint, let them inlarge their prerogative as they\npleased, judging rightly, that they did nothing herein to the prejudice\nof their laws, since they acted conformable to the foundation and end of\nall laws, the public good.\nSect. 166. Such god-like princes indeed had some title to arbitrary\npower by that argument, that would prove absolute monarchy the best\ngovernment, as that which God himself governs the universe by; because\nsuch kings partake of his wisdom and goodness. Upon this is founded that\nsaying, That the reigns of good princes have been always most dangerous\nto the liberties of their people: for when their successors, managing\nthe government with different thoughts, would draw the actions of those\ngood rulers into precedent, and make them the standard of their\nprerogative, as if what had been done only for the good of the people\nwas a right in them to do, for the harm of the people, if they so\npleased; it has often occasioned contest, and sometimes public\ndisorders, before the people could recover their original right, and get\nthat to be declared not to be prerogative, which truly was never so;\nsince it is impossible that any body in the society should ever have a\nright to do the people harm; though it be very possible, and reasonable,\nthat the people should not go about to set any bounds to the prerogative\nof those kings, or rulers, who themselves transgressed not the bounds of\nthe public good: for prerogative is nothing but the power of doing\npublic good without a rule.\nSect. 167. The power of calling parliaments in England, as to precise\ntime, place, and duration, is certainly a prerogative of the king, but\nstill with this trust, that it shall be made use of for the good of the\nnation, as the exigencies of the times, and variety of occasions, shall\nrequire: for it being impossible to foresee which should always be the\nfittest place for them to assemble in, and what the best season; the\nchoice of these was left with the executive power, as might be most\nsubservient to the public good, and best suit the ends of parliaments.\nSect. 168. The old question will be asked in this matter of prerogative,\nBut who shall be judge when this power is made a right use of one\nanswer: between an executive power in being, with such a prerogative,\nand a legislative that depends upon his will for their convening, there\ncan be no judge on earth; as there can be none between the legislative\nand the people, should either the executive, or the legislative, when\nthey have got the power in their hands, design, or go about to enslave\nor destroy them. The people have no other remedy in this, as in all\nother cases where they have no judge on earth, but to appeal to heaven:\nfor the rulers, in such attempts, exercising a power the people never\nput into their hands, (who can never be supposed to consent that any\nbody should rule over them for their harm) do that which they have not a\nright to do. And where the body of the people, or any single man, is\ndeprived of their right, or is under the exercise of a power without\nright, and have no appeal on earth, then they have a liberty to appeal\nto heaven, whenever they judge the cause of sufficient moment. And\ntherefore, though the people cannot be judge, so as to have, by the\nconstitution of that society, any superior power, to determine and give\neffective sentence in the case; yet they have, by a law antecedent and\nparamount to all positive laws of men, reserved that ultimate\ndetermination to themselves which belongs to all mankind, where there\nlies no appeal on earth, viz. to judge, whether they have just cause to\nmake their appeal to heaven. And this judgment they cannot part with, it\nbeing out of a man\u2019s power so to submit himself to another, as to give\nhim a liberty to destroy him; God and nature never allowing a man so to\nabandon himself, as to neglect his own preservation: and since he cannot\ntake away his own life, neither can he give another power to take it.\nNor let any one think, this lays a perpetual foundation for disorder;\nfor this operates not, till the inconveniency is so great, that the\nmajority feel it, and are weary of it, and find a necessity to have it\namended. But this the executive power, or wise princes, never need come\nin the danger of: and it is the thing, of all others, they have most\nneed to avoid, as of all others the most perilous.\nCHAPTER. XV.\nOF PATERNAL, POLITICAL, AND DESPOTICAL POWER, CONSIDERED TOGETHER.\nSect. 169. THOUGH I have had occasion to speak of these separately\nbefore, yet the great mistakes of late about government, having, as I\nsuppose, arisen from confounding these distinct powers one with another,\nit may not, perhaps, be amiss to consider them here together.\nSect. 170. First, then, Paternal or parental power is nothing but that\nwhich parents have over their children, to govern them for the\nchildren\u2019s good, till they come to the use of reason, or a state of\nknowledge, wherein they may be supposed capable to understand that rule,\nwhether it be the law of nature, or the municipal law of their country,\nthey are to govern themselves by: capable, I say, to know it, as well as\nseveral others, who live as freemen under that law. The affection and\ntenderness which God hath planted in the breast of parents towards their\nchildren, makes it evident, that this is not intended to be a severe\narbitrary government, but only for the help, instruction, and\npreservation of their offspring. But happen it as it will, there is, as\nI have proved, no reason why it should be thought to extend to life and\ndeath, at any time, over their children, more than over any body else;\nneither can there be any pretence why this parental power should keep\nthe child, when grown to a man, in subjection to the will of his\nparents, any farther than having received life and education from his\nparents, obliges him to respect, honour, gratitude, assistance and\nsupport, all his life, to both father and mother. And thus, \u2019tis true,\nthe paternal is a natural government, but not at all extending itself to\nthe ends and jurisdictions of that which is political. The power of the\nfather doth not reach at all to the property of the child, which is only\nin his own disposing.\nSect. 171. Secondly, Political power is that power, which every man\nhaving in the state of nature, has given up into the hands of the\nsociety, and therein to the governors, whom the society hath set over\nitself, with this express or tacit trust, that it shall be employed for\ntheir good, and the preservation of their property: now this power,\nwhich every man has in the state of nature, and which he parts with to\nthe society in all such cases where the society can secure him, is to\nuse such means, for the preserving of his own property, as he thinks\ngood, and nature allows him; and to punish the breach of the law of\nnature in others, so as (according to the best of his reason) may most\nconduce to the preservation of himself, and the rest of mankind. So that\nthe end and measure of this power, when in every man\u2019s hands in the\nstate of nature, being the preservation of all of his society, that is,\nall mankind in general, it can have no other end or measure, when in the\nhands of the magistrate, but to preserve the members of that society in\ntheir lives, liberties, and possessions; and so cannot be an absolute,\narbitrary power over their lives and fortunes, which are as much as\npossible to be preserved; but a power to make laws, and annex such\npenalties to them, as may tend to the preservation of the whole, by\ncutting off those parts, and those only, which are so corrupt, that they\nthreaten the sound and healthy, without which no severity is lawful. And\nthis power has its original only from compact and agreement, and the\nmutual consent of those who make up the community.\nSect. 172. Thirdly, Despotical power is an absolute, arbitrary power one\nman has over another, to take away his life, whenever he pleases. This\nis a power, which neither nature gives, for it has made no such\ndistinction between one man and another; nor compact can convey: for man\nnot having such an arbitrary power over his own life, cannot give\nanother man such a power over it; but it is the effect only of\nforfeiture, which the aggressor makes of his own life, when he puts\nhimself into the state of war with another: for having quitted reason,\nwhich God hath given to be the rule betwixt man and man, and the common\nbond whereby human kind is united into one fellowship and society; and\nhaving renounced the way of peace which that teaches, and made use of\nthe force of war, to compass his unjust ends upon another, where he has\nno right; and so revolting from his own kind to that of beasts, by\nmaking force, which is their\u2019s, to be his rule of right, he renders\nhimself liable to be destroyed by the injured person, and the rest of\nmankind, that will join with him in the execution of justice, as any\nother wild beast, or noxious brute, with whom mankind can have neither\nsociety nor security*. And thus captives, taken in a just and lawful\nwar, and such only, are subject to a despotical power, which, as it\narises not from compact, so neither is it capable of any, but is the\nstate of war continued: for what compact can be made with a man that is\nnot master of his own life? what condition can he perform? and if he be\nonce allowed to be master of his own life, the despotical, arbitrary\npower of his master ceases. He that is master of himself, and his own\nlife, has a right too to the means of preserving it; so that as soon as\ncompact enters, slavery ceases, and he so far quits his absolute power,\nand puts an end to the state of war, who enters into conditions with his\ncaptive.\n(*Another copy corrected by Mr. Locke, has it thus, Noxious brute that\nis destructive to their being.)\nSect. 173. Nature gives the first of these, viz. paternal power to\nparents for the benefit of their children during their minority, to\nsupply their want of ability, and understanding how to manage their\nproperty. (By property I must be understood here, as in other places, to\nmean that property which men have in their persons as well as goods.)\nVoluntary agreement gives the second, viz. political power to governors\nfor the benefit of their subjects, to secure them in the possession and\nuse of their properties. And forfeiture gives the third despotical power\nto lords for their own benefit, over those who are stripped of all\nproperty.\nSect. 174. He, that shall consider the distinct rise and extent, and the\ndifferent ends of these several powers, will plainly see, that paternal\npower comes as far short of that of the magistrate, as despotical\nexceeds it; and that absolute dominion, however placed, is so far from\nbeing one kind of civil society, that it is as inconsistent with it, as\nslavery is with property. Paternal power is only where minority makes\nthe child incapable to manage his property; political, where men have\nproperty in their own disposal; and despotical, over such as have no\nproperty at all.\nCHAPTER. XVI.\nOF CONQUEST.\nSect. 175. THOUGH governments can originally have no other rise than\nthat before mentioned, nor polities be founded on any thing but the\nconsent of the people; yet such have been the disorders ambition has\nfilled the world with, that in the noise of war, which makes so great a\npart of the history of mankind, this consent is little taken notice of:\nand therefore many have mistaken the force of arms for the consent of\nthe people, and reckon conquest as one of the originals of government.\nBut conquest is as far from setting up any government, as demolishing an\nhouse is from building a new one in the place. Indeed, it often makes\nway for a new frame of a commonwealth, by destroying the former; but,\nwithout the consent of the people, can never erect a new one.\nSect. 176. That the aggressor, who puts himself into the state of war\nwith another, and unjustly invades another man\u2019s right, can, by such an\nunjust war, never come to have a right over the conquered, will be\neasily agreed by all men, who will not think, that robbers and pyrates\nhave a right of empire over whomsoever they have force enough to master;\nor that men are bound by promises, which unlawful force extorts from\nthem. Should a robber break into my house, and with a dagger at my\nthroat make me seal deeds to convey my estate to him, would this give\nhim any title? Just such a title, by his sword, has an unjust conqueror,\nwho forces me into submission. The injury and the crime is equal,\nwhether committed by the wearer of a crown, or some petty villain. The\ntitle of the offender, and the number of his followers, make no\ndifference in the offence, unless it be to aggravate it. The only\ndifference is, great robbers punish little ones, to keep them in their\nobedience; but the great ones are rewarded with laurels and triumphs,\nbecause they are too big for the weak hands of justice in this world,\nand have the power in their own possession, which should punish\noffenders. What is my remedy against a robber, that so broke into my\nhouse? Appeal to the law for justice. But perhaps justice is denied, or\nI am crippled and cannot stir, robbed and have not the means to do it.\nIf God has taken away all means of seeking remedy, there is nothing left\nbut patience. But my son, when able, may seek the relief of the law,\nwhich I am denied: he or his son may renew his appeal, till he recover\nhis right. But the conquered, or their children, have no court, no\narbitrator on earth to appeal to. Then they may appeal, as Jephtha did,\nto heaven, and repeat their appeal till they have recovered the native\nright of their ancestors, which was, to have such a legislative over\nthem, as the majority should approve, and freely acquiesce in. If it be\nobjected, This would cause endless trouble; I answer, no more than\njustice does, where she lies open to all that appeal to her. He that\ntroubles his neighbour without a cause, is punished for it by the\njustice of the court he appeals to: and he that appeals to heaven must\nbe sure he has right on his side; and a right too that is worth the\ntrouble and cost of the appeal, as he will answer at a tribunal that\ncannot be deceived, and will be sure to retribute to every one according\nto the mischiefs he hath created to his fellow subjects; that is, any\npart of mankind: from whence it is plain, that he that conquers in an\nunjust war can thereby have no title to the subjection and obedience of\nthe conquered.\nSect. 177. But supposing victory favours the right side, let us consider\na conqueror in a lawful war, and see what power he gets, and over whom.\nFirst, It is plain he gets no power by his conquest over those that\nconquered with him. They that fought on his side cannot suffer by the\nconquest, but must at least be as much freemen as they were before. And\nmost commonly they serve upon terms, and on condition to share with\ntheir leader, and enjoy a part of the spoil, and other advantages that\nattend the conquering sword; or at least have a part of the subdued\ncountry bestowed upon them. And the conquering people are not, I hope,\nto be slaves by conquest, and wear their laurels only to shew they are\nsacrifices to their leaders triumph. They that found absolute monarchy\nupon the title of the sword, make their heroes, who are the founders of\nsuch monarchies, arrant Draw-can-sirs, and forget they had any officers\nand soldiers that fought on their side in the battles they won, or\nassisted them in the subduing, or shared in possessing, the countries\nthey mastered. We are told by some, that the English monarchy is founded\nin the Norman conquest, and that our princes have thereby a title to\nabsolute dominion: which if it were true, (as by the history it appears\notherwise) and that William had a right to make war on this island; yet\nhis dominion by conquest could reach no farther than to the Saxons and\nBritons, that were then inhabitants of this country. The Normans that\ncame with him, and helped to conquer, and all descended from them, are\nfreemen, and no subjects by conquest; let that give what dominion it\nwill. And if I, or any body else, shall claim freedom, as derived from\nthem, it will be very hard to prove the contrary: and it is plain, the\nlaw, that has made no distinction between the one and the other, intends\nnot there should be any difference in their freedom or privileges.\nSect. 178. But supposing, which seldom happens, that the conquerors and\nconquered never incorporate into one people, under the same laws and\nfreedom; let us see next what power a lawful conqueror has over the\nsubdued: and that I say is purely despotical. He has an absolute power\nover the lives of those who by an unjust war have forfeited them; but\nnot over the lives or fortunes of those who engaged not in the war, nor\nover the possessions even of those who were actually engaged in it.\nSect. 179. Secondly, I say then the conqueror gets no power but only\nover those who have actually assisted, concurred, or consented to that\nunjust force that is used against him: for the people having given to\ntheir governors no power to do an unjust thing, such as is to make an\nunjust war, (for they never had such a power in themselves) they ought\nnot to be charged as guilty of the violence and unjustice that is\ncommitted in an unjust war, any farther than they actually abet it; no\nmore than they are to be thought guilty of any violence or oppression\ntheir governors should use upon the people themselves, or any part of\ntheir fellow subjects, they having empowered them no more to the one\nthan to the other. Conquerors, it is true, seldom trouble themselves to\nmake the distinction, but they willingly permit the confusion of war to\nsweep all together: but yet this alters not the right; for the\nconquerors power over the lives of the conquered, being only because\nthey have used force to do, or maintain an injustice, he can have that\npower only over those who have concurred in that force; all the rest are\ninnocent; and he has no more title over the people of that country, who\nhave done him no injury, and so have made no forfeiture of their lives,\nthan he has over any other, who, without any injuries or provocations,\nhave lived upon fair terms with him.\nSect. 180. Thirdly, The power a conqueror gets over those he overcomes\nin a just war, is perfectly despotical: he has an absolute power over\nthe lives of those, who, by putting themselves in a state of war, have\nforfeited them; but he has not thereby a right and title to their\npossessions. This I doubt not, but at first sight will seem a strange\ndoctrine, it being so quite contrary to the practice of the world; there\nbeing nothing more familiar in speaking of the dominion of countries,\nthan to say such an one conquered it; as if conquest, without any more\nado, conveyed a right of possession. But when we consider, that the\npractice of the strong and powerful, how universal soever it may be, is\nseldom the rule of right, however it be one part of the subjection of\nthe conquered, not to argue against the conditions cut out to them by\nthe conquering sword.\nSect. 181. Though in all war there be usually a complication of force\nand damage, and the aggressor seldom fails to harm the estate, when he\nuses force against the persons of those he makes war upon; yet it is the\nuse of force only that puts a man into the state of war: for whether by\nforce he begins the injury, or else having quietly, and by fraud, done\nthe injury, he refuses to make reparation, and by force maintains it,\n(which is the same thing, as at first to have done it by force) it is\nthe unjust use of force that makes the war: for he that breaks open my\nhouse, and violently turns me out of doors; or having peaceably got in,\nby force keeps me out, does in effect the same thing; supposing we are\nin such a state, that we have no common judge on earth, whom I may\nappeal to, and to whom we are both obliged to submit: for of such I am\nnow speaking. It is the unjust use of force then, that puts a man into\nthe state of war with another; and thereby he that is guilty of it makes\na forfeiture of his life: for quitting reason, which is the rule given\nbetween man and man, and using force, the way of beasts, he becomes\nliable to be destroyed by him he uses force against, as any savage\nravenous beast, that is dangerous to his being.\nSect. 182. But because the miscarriages of the father are no faults of\nthe children, and they may be rational and peaceable, notwithstanding\nthe brutishness and injustice of the father; the father, by his\nmiscarriages and violence, can forfeit but his own life, but involves\nnot his children in his guilt or destruction. His goods, which nature,\nthat willeth the preservation of all mankind as much as is possible,\nhath made to belong to the children to keep them from perishing, do\nstill continue to belong to his children: for supposing them not to have\njoined in the war, either thro\u2019 infancy, absence, or choice, they have\ndone nothing to forfeit them: nor has the conqueror any right to take\nthem away, by the bare title of having subdued him that by force\nattempted his destruction; though perhaps he may have some right to\nthem, to repair the damages he has sustained by the war, and the defence\nof his own right; which how far it reaches to the possessions of the\nconquered, we shall see by and by. So that he that by conquest has a\nright over a man\u2019s person to destroy him if he pleases, has not thereby\na right over his estate to possess and enjoy it: for it is the brutal\nforce the aggressor has used, that gives his adversary a right to take\naway his life, and destroy him if he pleases, as a noxious creature; but\nit is damage sustained that alone gives him title to another man\u2019s\ngoods: for though I may kill a thief that sets on me in the highway, yet\nI may not (which seems less) take away his money, and let him go: this\nwould be robbery on my side. His force, and the state of war he put\nhimself in, made him forfeit his life, but gave me no title to his\ngoods. The right then of conquest extends only to the lives of those who\njoined in the war, not to their estates, but only in order to make\nreparation for the damages received, and the charges of the war, and\nthat too with reservation of the right of the innocent wife and\nchildren.\nSect. 183. Let the conqueror have as much justice on his side, as could\nbe supposed, he has no right to seize more than the vanquished could\nforfeit: his life is at the victor\u2019s mercy; and his service and goods he\nmay appropriate, to make himself reparation; but he cannot take the\ngoods of his wife and children; they too had a title to the goods he\nenjoyed, and their shares in the estate he possessed: for example, I in\nthe state of nature (and all commonwealths are in the state of nature\none with another) have injured another man, and refusing to give\nsatisfaction, it comes to a state of war, wherein my defending by force\nwhat I had gotten unjustly, makes me the aggressor. I am conquered: my\nlife, it is true, as forfeit, is at mercy, but not my wife\u2019s and\nchildren\u2019s. They made not the war, nor assisted in it. I could not\nforfeit their lives; they were not mine to forfeit. My wife had a share\nin my estate; that neither could I forfeit. And my children also, being\nborn of me, had a right to be maintained out of my labour or substance.\nHere then is the case: the conqueror has a title to reparation for\ndamages received, and the children have a title to their father\u2019s estate\nfor their subsistence: for as to the wife\u2019s share, whether her own\nlabour, or compact, gave her a title to it, it is plain, her husband\ncould not forfeit what was her\u2019s. What must be done in the case? I\nanswer; the fundamental law of nature being, that all, as much as may\nbe, should be preserved, it follows, that if there be not enough fully\nto satisfy both, viz, for the conqueror\u2019s losses, and children\u2019s\nmaintenance, he that hath, and to spare, must remit something of his\nfull satisfaction, and give way to the pressing and preferable title of\nthose who are in danger to perish without it.\nSect. 184. But supposing the charge and damages of the war are to be\nmade up to the conqueror, to the utmost farthing; and that the children\nof the vanquished, spoiled of all their father\u2019s goods, are to be left\nto starve and perish; yet the satisfying of what shall, on this score,\nbe due to the conqueror, will scarce give him a title to any country he\nshall conquer: for the damages of war can scarce amount to the value of\nany considerable tract of land, in any part of the world, where all the\nland is possessed, and none lies waste. And if I have not taken away the\nconqueror\u2019s land, which, being vanquished, it is impossible I should;\nscarce any other spoil I have done him can amount to the value of mine,\nsupposing it equally cultivated, and of an extent any way coming near\nwhat I had overrun of his. The destruction of a year\u2019s product or two\n(for it seldom reaches four or five) is the utmost spoil that usually\ncan be done: for as to money, and such riches and treasure taken away,\nthese are none of nature\u2019s goods, they have but a fantastical imaginary\nvalue: nature has put no such upon them: they are of no more account by\nher standard, than the wampompeke of the Americans to an European\nprince, or the silver money of Europe would have been formerly to an\nAmerican. And five years product is not worth the perpetual inheritance\nof land, where all is possessed, and none remains waste, to be taken up\nby him that is disseized: which will be easily granted, if one do but\ntake away the imaginary value of money, the disproportion being more\nthan between five and five hundred; though, at the same time, half a\nyear\u2019s product is more worth than the inheritance, where there being\nmore land than the inhabitants possess and make use of, any one has\nliberty to make use of the waste: but there conquerors take little care\nto possess themselves of the lands of the vanquished, No damage\ntherefore, that men in the state of nature (as all princes and\ngovernments are in reference to one another) suffer from one another,\ncan give a conqueror power to dispossess the posterity of the\nvanquished, and turn them out of that inheritance, which ought to be the\npossession of them and their descendants to all generations. The\nconqueror indeed will be apt to think himself master: and it is the very\ncondition of the subdued not to be able to dispute their right. But if\nthat be all, it gives no other title than what bare force gives to the\nstronger over the weaker: and, by this reason, he that is strongest will\nhave a right to whatever he pleases to seize on.\nSect. 185. Over those then that joined with him in the war, and over\nthose of the subdued country that opposed him not, and the posterity\neven of those that did, the conqueror, even in a just war, hath, by his\nconquest, no right of dominion: they are free from any subjection to\nhim, and if their former government be dissolved, they are at liberty to\nbegin and erect another to themselves.\nSect. 186. The conqueror, it is true, usually, by the force he has over\nthem, compels them, with a sword at their breasts, to stoop to his\nconditions, and submit to such a government as he pleases to afford\nthem; but the enquiry is, what right he has to do so? If it be said,\nthey submit by their own consent, then this allows their own consent to\nbe necessary to give the conqueror a title to rule over them. It remains\nonly to be considered, whether promises extorted by force, without\nright, can be thought consent, and how far they bind. To which I shall\nsay, they bind not at all; because whatsoever another gets from me by\nforce, I still retain the right of, and he is obliged presently to\nrestore. He that forces my horse from me, ought presently to restore\nhim, and I have still a right to retake him. By the same reason, he that\nforced a promise from me, ought presently to restore it, i.e. quit me of\nthe obligation of it; or I may resume it myself, i.e. chuse whether I\nwill perform it: for the law of nature laying an obligation on me only\nby the rules she prescribes, cannot oblige me by the violation of her\nrules: such is the extorting any thing from me by force. Nor does it at\nall alter the case to say, I gave my promise, no more than it excuses\nthe force, and passes the right, when I put my hand in my pocket, and\ndeliver my purse myself to a thief, who demands it with a pistol at my\nbreast.\nSect. 187. From all which it follows, that the government of a\nconqueror, imposed by force on the subdued, against whom he had no right\nof war, or who joined not in the war against him, where he had right,\nhas no obligation upon them.\nSect. 188. But let us suppose, that all the men of that community, being\nall members of the same body politic, may be taken to have joined in\nthat unjust war wherein they are subdued, and so their lives are at the\nmercy of the conqueror.\nSect. 189. I say this concerns not their children who are in their\nminority: for since a father hath not, in himself, a power over the life\nor liberty of his child, no act of his can possibly forfeit it. So that\nthe children, whatever may have happened to the fathers, are freemen,\nand the absolute power of the conqueror reaches no farther than the\npersons of the men that were subdued by him, and dies with them: and\nshould he govern them as slaves, subjected to his absolute arbitrary\npower, he has no such right of dominion over their children. He can have\nno power over them but by their own consent, whatever he may drive them\nto say or do; and he has no lawfull authority, whilst force, and not\nchoice, compels them to submission.\nSect. 190. Every man is born with a double right: first, a right of\nfreedom to his person, which no other man has a power over, but the free\ndisposal of it lies in himself. Secondly, a right, before any other man,\nto inherit with his brethren his father\u2019s goods.\nSect. 191. By the first of these, a man is naturally free from\nsubjection to any government, tho\u2019 he be born in a place under its\njurisdiction; but if he disclaim the lawful government of the country he\nwas born in, he must also quit the right that belonged to him by the\nlaws of it, and the possessions there descending to him from his\nancestors, if it were a government made by their consent.\nSect. 192. By the second, the inhabitants of any country, who are\ndescended, and derive a title to their estates from those who are\nsubdued, and had a government forced upon them against their free\nconsents, retain a right to the possession of their ancestors, though\nthey consent not freely to the government, whose hard conditions were by\nforce imposed on the possessors of that country: for the first conqueror\nnever having had a title to the land of that country, the people who are\nthe descendants of, or claim under those who were forced to submit to\nthe yoke of a government by constraint, have always a right to shake it\noff, and free themselves from the usurpation or tyranny which the sword\nhath brought in upon them, till their rulers put them under such a frame\nof government as they willingly and of choice consent to. Who doubts but\nthe Grecian Christians, descendants of the ancient possessors of that\ncountry, may justly cast off the Turkish yoke, which they have so long\ngroaned under, whenever they have an opportunity to do it? For no\ngovernment can have a right to obedience from a people who have not\nfreely consented to it; which they can never be supposed to do, till\neither they are put in a full state of liberty to chuse their government\nand governors, or at least till they have such standing laws, to which\nthey have by themselves or their representatives given their free\nconsent, and also till they are allowed their due property, which is so\nto be proprietors of what they have, that no body can take away any part\nof it without their own consent, without which, men under any government\nare not in the state of freemen, but are direct slaves under the force\nof war.\nSect. 193. But granting that the conqueror in a just war has a right to\nthe estates, as well as power over the persons, of the conquered; which,\nit is plain, he hath not: nothing of absolute power will follow from\nhence, in the continuance of the government; because the descendants of\nthese being all freemen, if he grants them estates and possessions to\ninhabit his country, (without which it would be worth nothing)\nwhatsoever he grants them, they have, so far as it is granted, property\nin. The nature whereof is, that without a man\u2019s own consent it cannot be\ntaken from him.\nSect. 194. Their persons are free by a native right, and their\nproperties, be they more or less, are their own, and at their own\ndispose, and not at his; or else it is no property. Supposing the\nconqueror gives to one man a thousand acres, to him and his heirs for\never; to another he lets a thousand acres for his life, under the rent\nof 50_l_. or 500_l_. per ann. has not the one of these a right to his\nthousand acres for ever, and the other, during his life, paying the said\nrent? and hath not the tenant for life a property in all that he gets\nover and above his rent, by his labour and industry during the said\nterm, supposing it be double the rent? Can any one say, the king, or\nconqueror, after his grant, may by his power of conqueror take away all,\nor part of the land from the heirs of one, or from the other during his\nlife, he paying the rent? or can he take away from either the goods or\nmoney they have got upon the said land, at his pleasure? If he can, then\nall free and voluntary contracts cease, and are void in the world; there\nneeds nothing to dissolve them at any time, but power enough: and all\nthe grants and promises of men in power are but mockery and collusion:\nfor can there be any thing more ridiculous than to say, I give you and\nyour\u2019s this for ever, and that in the surest and most solemn way of\nconveyance can be devised; and yet it is to be understood, that I have\nright, if I please, to take it away from you again to morrow?\nSect. 195. I will not dispute now whether princes are exempt from the\nlaws of their country; but this I am sure, they owe subjection to the\nlaws of God and nature. No body, no power, can exempt them from the\nobligations of that eternal law. Those are so great, and so strong, in\nthe case of promises, that omnipotency itself can be tied by them.\nGrants, promises, and oaths, are bonds that hold the Almighty: whatever\nsome flatterers say to princes of the world, who all together, with all\ntheir people joined to them, are, in comparison of the great God, but as\na drop of the bucket, or a dust on the balance, inconsiderable, nothing!\nSect. 196. The short of the case in conquest is this: the conqueror, if\nhe have a just cause, has a despotical right over the persons of all,\nthat actually aided, and concurred in the war against him, and a right\nto make up his damage and cost out of their labour and estates, so he\ninjure not the right of any other. Over the rest of the people, if there\nwere any that consented not to the war, and over the children of the\ncaptives themselves, or the possessions of either, he has no power; and\nso can have, by virtue of conquest, no lawful title himself to dominion\nover them, or derive it to his posterity; but is an aggressor, if he\nattempts upon their properties, and thereby puts himself in a state of\nwar against them, and has no better a right of principality, he, nor any\nof his successors, than Hingar, or Hubba, the Danes, had here in\nEngland; or Spartacus, had he conquered Italy, would have had; which is\nto have their yoke cast off, as soon as God shall give those under their\nsubjection courage and opportunity to do it. Thus, notwithstanding\nwhatever title the kings of Assyria had over Judah, by the sword, God\nassisted Hezekiah to throw off the dominion of that conquering empire.\nAnd the lord was with Hezekiah, and he prospered; wherefore he went\nforth, and he rebelled against the king of Assyria, and served him not,\n2 Kings xviii. 7. Whence it is plain, that shaking off a power, which\nforce, and not right, hath set over any one, though it hath the name of\nrebellion, yet is no offence before God, but is that which he allows and\ncountenances, though even promises and covenants, when obtained by\nforce, have intervened: for it is very probable, to any one that reads\nthe story of Ahaz and Hezekiah attentively, that the Assyrians subdued\nAhaz, and deposed him, and made Hezekiah king in his father\u2019s lifetime;\nand that Hezekiah by agreement had done him homage, and paid him tribute\nall this time.\nCHAPTER. XVII.\nOF USURPATION.\nSect. 197. AS conquest may be called a foreign usurpation, so usurpation\nis a kind of domestic conquest, with this difference, that an usurper\ncan never have right on his side, it being no usurpation, but where one\nis got into the possession of what another has right to. This, so far as\nit is usurpation, is a change only of persons, but not of the forms and\nrules of the government: for if the usurper extend his power beyond what\nof right belonged to the lawful princes, or governors of the\ncommonwealth, it is tyranny added to usurpation.\nSect. 198. In all lawful governments, the designation of the persons,\nwho are to bear rule, is as natural and necessary a part as the form of\nthe government itself, and is that which had its establishment\noriginally from the people; the anarchy being much alike, to have no\nform of government at all; or to agree, that it shall be monarchical,\nbut to appoint no way to design the person that shall have the power,\nand be the monarch. Hence all commonwealths, with the form of government\nestablished, have rules also of appointing those who are to have any\nshare in the public authority, and settled methods of conveying the\nright to them: for the anarchy is much alike, to have no form of\ngovernment at all; or to agree that it shall be monarchical, but to\nappoint no way to know or design the person that shall have the power,\nand be the monarch. Whoever gets into the exercise of any part of the\npower, by other ways than what the laws of the community have\nprescribed, hath no right to be obeyed, though the form of the\ncommonwealth be still preserved; since he is not the person the laws\nhave appointed, and consequently not the person the people have\nconsented to. Nor can such an usurper, or any deriving from him, ever\nhave a title, till the people are both at liberty to consent, and have\nactually consented to allow, and confirm in him the power he hath till\nthen usurped.\nCHAPTER. XVIII.\nOF TYRANNY.\nSect. 199. AS usurpation is the exercise of power, which another hath a\nright to; so tyranny is the exercise of power beyond right, which no\nbody can have a right to. And this is making use of the power any one\nhas in his hands, not for the good of those who are under it, but for\nhis own private separate advantage. When the governor, however intitled,\nmakes not the law, but his will, the rule; and his commands and actions\nare not directed to the preservation of the properties of his people,\nbut the satisfaction of his own ambition, revenge, covetousness, or any\nother irregular passion.\nSect. 200. If one can doubt this to be truth, or reason, because it\ncomes from the obscure hand of a subject, I hope the authority of a king\nwill make it pass with him. King James the first, in his speech to the\nparliament, 1603, tells them thus,\n/#\nI will ever prefer the weal of the public, and of the whole\ncommonwealth, in making of good laws and constitutions, to any\nparticular and private ends of mine; thinking ever the wealth and\nweal of the commonwealth to be my greatest weal and worldly\nfelicity; a point wherein a lawful king doth directly differ from a\ntyrant: for I do acknowledge, that the special and greatest point\nof difference that is between a rightful king and an usurping\ntyrant, is this, that whereas the proud and ambitious tyrant doth\nthink his kingdom and people are only ordained for satisfaction of\nhis desires and unreasonable appetites, the righteous and just king\ndoth by the contrary acknowledge himself to be ordained for the\nprocuring of the wealth and property of his people.\n#/\nAnd again, in his speech to the parliament, 1609, he hath these words:\n/#\nThe king binds himself by a double oath, to the observation of the\nfundamental laws of his kingdom; tacitly, as by being a king, and\nso bound to protect as well the people, as the laws of his kingdom;\nand expressly, by his oath at his coronation, so as every just\nking, in a settled kingdom, is bound to observe that paction made\nto his people, by his laws, in framing his government agreeable\nthereunto, according to that paction which God made with Noah after\nthe deluge. Hereafter, seed-time and harvest, and cold and heat,\nand summer and winter, and day and night, shall not cease while the\nearth remaineth. And therefore a king governing in a settled\nkingdom, leaves to be a king, and degenerates into a tyrant, as\nsoon as he leaves off to rule according to his laws.\n#/\nAnd a little after,\n/#\nTherefore all kings that are not tyrants, or perjured, will be glad\nto bound themselves within the limits of their laws; and they that\npersuade them the contrary, are vipers, and pests both against them\nand the commonwealth.\n#/\nThus that learned king, who well understood the notion of things, makes\nthe difference betwixt a king and a tyrant to consist only in this, that\none makes the laws the bounds of his power, and the good of the public,\nthe end of his government; the other makes all give way to his own will\nand appetite.\nSect. 201. It is a mistake, to think this fault is proper only to\nmonarchies; other forms of government are liable to it, as well as that:\nfor wherever the power, that is put in any hands for the government of\nthe people, and the preservation of their properties, is applied to\nother ends, and made use of to impoverish, harass, or subdue them to the\narbitrary and irregular commands of those that have it; there it\npresently becomes tyranny, whether those that thus use it are one or\nmany. Thus we read of the thirty tyrants at Athens, as well as one at\nSyracuse; and the intolerable dominion of the Decemviri at Rome was\nnothing better.\nSect. 202. Where-ever law ends, tyranny begins, if the law be\ntransgressed to another\u2019s harm; and whosoever in authority exceeds the\npower given him by the law, and makes use of the force he has under his\ncommand, to compass that upon the subject, which the law allows not,\nceases in that to be a magistrate; and, acting without authority, may be\nopposed, as any other man, who by force invades the right of another.\nThis is acknowledged in subordinate magistrates. He that hath authority\nto seize my person in the street, may be opposed as a thief and a\nrobber, if he endeavours to break into my house to execute a writ,\nnotwithstanding that I know he has such a warrant, and such a legal\nauthority, as will impower him to arrest me abroad. And why this should\nnot hold in the highest, as well as in the most inferior magistrate, I\nwould gladly be informed. Is it reasonable, that the eldest brother,\nbecause he has the greatest part of his father\u2019s estate, should thereby\nhave a right to take away any of his younger brothers portions? or that\na rich man, who possessed a whole country, should from thence have a\nright to seize, when he pleased, the cottage and garden of his poor\nneighbour? The being rightfully possessed of great power and riches,\nexceedingly beyond the greatest part of the sons of Adam, is so far from\nbeing an excuse, much less a reason, for rapine and oppression, which\nthe endamaging another without authority is, that it is a great\naggravation of it: for the exceeding the bounds of authority is no more\na right in a great, than in a petty officer; no more justifiable in a\nking than a constable; but is so much the worse in him, in that he has\nmore trust put in him, has already a much greater share than the rest of\nhis brethren, and is supposed, from the advantages of his education,\nemployment, and counsellors, to be more knowing in the measures of right\nand wrong.\nSect. 203. May the commands then of a prince be opposed? may he be\nresisted as often as any one shall find himself aggrieved, and but\nimagine he has not right done him? This will unhinge and overturn all\npolities, and, instead of government and order, leave nothing but\nanarchy and confusion.\nSect. 204. To this I answer, that force is to be opposed to nothing, but\nto unjust and unlawful force; whoever makes any opposition in any other\ncase, draws on himself a just condemnation both from God and man; and so\nno such danger or confusion will follow, as is often suggested: for,\nSect. 205. First, As, in some countries, the person of the prince by the\nlaw is sacred; and so, whatever he commands or does, his person is still\nfree from all question or violence, not liable to force, or any judicial\ncensure or condemnation. But yet opposition may be made to the illegal\nacts of any inferior officer, or other commissioned by him; unless he\nwill, by actually putting himself into a state of war with his people,\ndissolve the government, and leave them to that defence which belongs to\nevery one in the state of nature: for of such things who can tell what\nthe end will be? and a neighbour kingdom has shewed the world an odd\nexample. In all other cases the sacredness of the person exempts him\nfrom all inconveniencies, whereby he is secure, whilst the government\nstands, from all violence and harm whatsoever; than which there cannot\nbe a wiser constitution: for the harm he can do in his own person not\nbeing likely to happen often, nor to extend itself far; nor being able\nby his single strength to subvert the laws, nor oppress the body of the\npeople, should any prince have so much weakness, and ill nature as to be\nwilling to do it, the inconveniency of some particular mischiefs, that\nmay happen sometimes, when a heady prince comes to the throne, are well\nrecompensed by the peace of the public, and security of the government,\nin the person of the chief magistrate, thus set out of the reach of\ndanger: it being safer for the body, that some few private men should be\nsometimes in danger to suffer, than that the head of the republic should\nbe easily, and upon slight occasions, exposed.\nSect. 206. Secondly, But this privilege, belonging only to the king\u2019s\nperson, hinders not, but they may be questioned, opposed, and resisted,\nwho use unjust force, though they pretend a commission from him, which\nthe law authorizes not; as is plain in the case of him that has the\nking\u2019s writ to arrest a man, which is a full commission from the king;\nand yet he that has it cannot break open a man\u2019s house to do it, nor\nexecute this command of the king upon certain days, nor in certain\nplaces, though this commission have no such exception in it; but they\nare the limitations of the law, which if any one transgress, the king\u2019s\ncommission excuses him not: for the king\u2019s authority being given him\nonly by the law, he cannot impower any one to act against the law, or\njustify him, by his commission, in so doing; the commission, or command\nof any magistrate, where he has no authority, being as void and\ninsignificant, as that of any private man; the difference between the\none and the other, being that the magistrate has some authority so far,\nand to such ends, and the private man has none at all: for it is not the\ncommission, but the authority, that gives the right of acting; and\nagainst the laws there can be no authority. But, notwithstanding such\nresistance, the king\u2019s person and authority are still both secured, and\nso no danger to governor or government.\nSect. 207. Thirdly, Supposing a government wherein the person of the\nchief magistrate is not thus sacred; yet this doctrine of the lawfulness\nof resisting all unlawful exercises of his power, will not upon every\nslight occasion indanger him, or imbroil the government: for where the\ninjured party may be relieved, and his damages repaired by appeal to the\nlaw, there can be no pretence for force, which is only to be used where\na man is intercepted from appealing to the law: for nothing is to be\naccounted hostile force, but where it leaves not the remedy of such an\nappeal; and it is such force alone, that puts him that uses it into a\nstate of war, and makes it lawful to resist him. A man with a sword in\nhis hand demands my purse in the high-way, when perhaps I have not\ntwelve pence in my pocket: this man I may lawfully kill. To another I\ndeliver 100 pounds to hold only whilst I alight, which he refuses to\nrestore me, when I am got up again, but draws his sword to defend the\npossession of it by force, if I endeavour to retake it. The mischief\nthis man does me is a hundred, or possibly a thousand times more than\nthe other perhaps intended me (whom I killed before he really did me\nany); and yet I might lawfully kill the one, and cannot so much as hurt\nthe other lawfully. The reason whereof is plain; because the one using\nforce, which threatened my life, I could not have time to appeal to the\nlaw to secure it: and when it was gone, it was too late to appeal. The\nlaw could not restore life to my dead carcass: the loss was irreparable;\nwhich to prevent, the law of nature gave me a right to destroy him, who\nhad put himself into a state of war with me, and threatened my\ndestruction. But in the other case, my life not being in danger, I may\nhave the benefit of appealing to the law, and have reparation for my 100\npounds that way.\nSect. 208. Fourthly, But if the unlawful acts done by the magistrate be\nmaintained (by the power he has got), and the remedy which is due by\nlaw, be by the same power obstructed; yet the right of resisting, even\nin such manifest acts of tyranny, will not suddenly, or on slight\noccasions, disturb the government: for if it reach no farther than some\nprivate men\u2019s cases, though they have a right to defend themselves, and\nto recover by force what by unlawful force is taken from them; yet the\nright to do so will not easily engage them in a contest, wherein they\nare sure to perish; it being as impossible for one, or a few oppressed\nmen to disturb the government, where the body of the people do not think\nthemselves concerned in it, as for a raving mad-man, or heady malcontent\nto overturn a well settled state; the people being as little apt to\nfollow the one, as the other.\nSect. 209. But if either these illegal acts have extended to the\nmajority of the people; or if the mischief and oppression has lighted\nonly on some few, but in such cases, as the precedent, and consequences\nseem to threaten all; and they are persuaded in their consciences, that\ntheir laws, and with them their estates, liberties, and lives are in\ndanger, and perhaps their religion too; how they will be hindered from\nresisting illegal force, used against them, I cannot tell. This is an\ninconvenience, I confess, that attends all governments whatsoever, when\nthe governors have brought it to this pass, to be generally suspected of\ntheir people; the most dangerous state which they can possibly put\nthemselves in, wherein they are the less to be pitied, because it is so\neasy to be avoided; it being as impossible for a governor, if he really\nmeans the good of his people, and the preservation of them, and their\nlaws together, not to make them see and feel it, as it is for the father\nof a family, not to let his children see he loves, and takes care of\nthem.\nSect. 210. But if all the world shall observe pretences of one kind, and\nactions of another; arts used to elude the law, and the trust of\nprerogative (which is an arbitrary power in some things left in the\nprince\u2019s hand to do good, not harm to the people) employed contrary to\nthe end for which it was given: if the people shall find the ministers\nand subordinate magistrates chosen suitable to such ends, and favoured,\nor laid by, proportionably as they promote or oppose them: if they see\nseveral experiments made of arbitrary power, and that religion underhand\nfavoured, (tho\u2019 publicly proclaimed against) which is readiest to\nintroduce it; and the operators in it supported, as much as may be; and\nwhen that cannot be done, yet approved still, and liked the better: if a\nlong train of actions shew the councils all tending that way; how can a\nman any more hinder himself from being persuaded in his own mind, which\nway things are going; or from casting about how to save himself, than he\ncould from believing the captain of the ship he was in, was carrying\nhim, and the rest of the company, to Algiers, when he found him always\nsteering that course, though cross winds, leaks in his ship, and want of\nmen and provisions did often force him to turn his course another way\nfor some time, which he steadily returned to again, as soon as the wind,\nweather, and other circumstances would let him?\nCHAPTER. XIX.\nOF THE DISSOLUTION OF GOVERNMENT.\nSect. 211. HE that will with any clearness speak of the dissolution of\ngovernment, ought in the first place to distinguish between the\ndissolution of the society and the dissolution of the government. That\nwhich makes the community, and brings men out of the loose state of\nnature, into one politic society, is the agreement which every one has\nwith the rest to incorporate, and act as one body, and so be one\ndistinct commonwealth. The usual, and almost only way whereby this\nunion is dissolved, is the inroad of foreign force making a conquest\nupon them: for in that case, (not being able to maintain and support\nthemselves, as one intire and independent body) the union belonging to\nthat body which consisted therein, must necessarily cease, and so every\none return to the state he was in before, with a liberty to shift for\nhimself, and provide for his own safety, as he thinks fit, in some other\nsociety. Whenever the society is dissolved, it is certain the government\nof that society cannot remain. Thus conquerors swords often cut up\ngovernments by the roots, and mangle societies to pieces, separating the\nsubdued or scattered multitude from the protection of, and dependence\non, that society which ought to have preserved them from violence. The\nworld is too well instructed in, and too forward to allow of, this way\nof dissolving of governments, to need any more to be said of it; and\nthere wants not much argument to prove, that where the society is\ndissolved, the government cannot remain; that being as impossible, as\nfor the frame of an house to subsist when the materials of it are\nscattered and dissipated by a whirl-wind, or jumbled into a confused\nheap by an earthquake.\nSect. 212. Besides this over-turning from without, governments are\ndissolved from within.\nFirst, When the legislative is altered. Civil society being a state of\npeace, amongst those who are of it, from whom the state of war is\nexcluded by the umpirage, which they have provided in their legislative,\nfor the ending all differences that may arise amongst any of them, it is\nin their legislative, that the members of a commonwealth are united, and\ncombined together into one coherent living body. This is the soul that\ngives form, life, and unity, to the commonwealth: from hence the\nseveral members have their mutual influence, sympathy, and connexion:\nand therefore, when the legislative is broken, or dissolved, dissolution\nand death follows: for the essence and union of the society consisting\nin having one will, the legislative, when once established by the\nmajority, has the declaring, and as it were keeping of that will. The\nconstitution of the legislative is the first and fundamental act of\nsociety, whereby provision is made for the continuation of their union,\nunder the direction of persons, and bonds of laws, made by persons\nauthorized thereunto, by the consent and appointment of the people,\nwithout which no one man, or number of men, amongst them, can have\nauthority of making laws that shall be binding to the rest. When any\none, or more, shall take upon them to make laws, whom the people have\nnot appointed so to do, they make laws without authority, which the\npeople are not therefore bound to obey; by which means they come again\nto be out of subjection, and may constitute to themselves a new\nlegislative, as they think best, being in full liberty to resist the\nforce of those, who without authority would impose any thing upon them.\nEvery one is at the disposure of his own will, when those who had, by\nthe delegation of the society, the declaring of the public will, are\nexcluded from it, and others usurp the place, who have no such authority\nor delegation.\nSect. 213. This being usually brought about by such in the commonwealth\nwho misuse the power they have; it is hard to consider it aright, and\nknow at whose door to lay it, without knowing the form of government in\nwhich it happens. Let us suppose then the legislative placed in the\nconcurrence of three distinct persons.\n(<i>1</i>). A single hereditary person, having the constant, supreme,\nexecutive power, and with it the power of convoking and dissolving the\nother two within certain periods of time.\n(<i>2</i>). An assembly of hereditary nobility.\n(<i>3</i>). An assembly of representatives chosen, pro tempore, by the\npeople. Such a form of government supposed, it is evident,\nSect. 214. First, That when such a single person, or prince, sets up his\nown arbitrary will in place of the laws, which are the will of the\nsociety, declared by the legislative, then the legislative is changed:\nfor that being in effect the legislative, whose rules and laws are put\nin execution, and required to be obeyed; when other laws are set up, and\nother rules pretended, and inforced, than what the legislative,\nconstituted by the society, have enacted, it is plain that the\nlegislative is changed. Whoever introduces new laws, not being thereunto\nauthorized by the fundamental appointment of the society, or subverts\nthe old, disowns and overturns the power by which they were made, and so\nsets up a new legislative.\nSect. 215. Secondly, When the prince hinders the legislative from\nassembling in its due time, or from acting freely, pursuant to those\nends for which it was constituted, the legislative is altered: for it is\nnot a certain number of men, no, nor their meeting, unless they have\nalso freedom of debating, and leisure of perfecting, what is for the\ngood of the society, wherein the legislative consists: when these are\ntaken away or altered, so as to deprive the society of the due exercise\nof their power, the legislative is truly altered; for it is not names\nthat constitute governments, but the use and exercise of those powers\nthat were intended to accompany them; so that he, who takes away the\nfreedom, or hinders the acting of the legislative in its due seasons, in\neffect takes away the legislative, and puts an end to the government.\nSect. 216. Thirdly, When, by the arbitrary power of the prince, the\nelectors, or ways of election, are altered, without the consent, and\ncontrary to the common interest of the people, there also the\nlegislative is altered: for, if others than those whom the society hath\nauthorized thereunto, do chuse, or in another way than what the society\nhath prescribed, those chosen are not the legislative appointed by the\npeople.\nSect. 217. Fourthly, The delivery also of the people into the subjection\nof a foreign power, either by the prince, or by the legislative, is\ncertainly a change of the legislative, and so a dissolution of the\ngovernment: for the end why people entered into society being to be\npreserved one intire, free, independent society, to be governed by its\nown laws; this is lost, whenever they are given up into the power of\nanother.\nSect. 218. Why, in such a constitution as this, the dissolution of the\ngovernment in these cases is to be imputed to the prince, is evident;\nbecause he, having the force, treasure and offices of the state to\nemploy, and often persuading himself, or being flattered by others, that\nas supreme magistrate he is uncapable of controul; he alone is in a\ncondition to make great advances toward such changes, under pretence of\nlawful authority, and has it in his hands to terrify or suppress\nopposers, as factious, seditious, and enemies to the government: whereas\nno other part of the legislative, or people, is capable by themselves to\nattempt any alteration of the legislative, without open and visible\nrebellion, apt enough to be taken notice of, which, when it prevails,\nproduces effects very little different from foreign conquest. Besides,\nthe prince in such a form of government, having the power of dissolving\nthe other parts of the legislative, and thereby rendering them private\npersons, they can never in opposition to him, or without his\nconcurrence, alter the legislative by a law, his consent being necessary\nto give any of their decrees that sanction. But yet, so far as the other\nparts of the legislative any way contribute to any attempt upon the\ngovernment, and do either promote, or not, what lies in them, hinder\nsuch designs, they are guilty, and partake in this, which is certainly\nthe greatest crime which men can partake of one towards another.\nSec. 219.There is one way more whereby such a government may be\ndissolved, and that is: When he who has the supreme executive power,\nneglects and abandons that charge, so that the laws already made can no\nlonger be put in execution. This is demonstratively to reduce all to\nanarchy, and so effectually to dissolve the government: for laws not\nbeing made for themselves, but to be, by their execution, the bonds of\nthe society, to keep every part of the body politic in its due place and\nfunction; when that totally ceases, the government visibly ceases, and\nthe people become a confused multitude, without order or connexion.\nWhere there is no longer the administration of justice, for the securing\nof men\u2019s rights, nor any remaining power within the community to direct\nthe force, or provide for the necessities of the public, there certainly\nis no government left. Where the laws cannot be executed, it is all one\nas if there were no laws; and a government without laws is, I suppose, a\nmystery in politics, unconceivable to human capacity, and inconsistent\nwith human society.\nSect. 220. In these and the like cases, when the government is\ndissolved, the people are at liberty to provide for themselves, by\nerecting a new legislative, differing from the other, by the change of\npersons, or form, or both, as they shall find it most for their safety\nand good: for the society can never, by the fault of another, lose the\nnative and original right it has to preserve itself, which can only be\ndone by a settled legislative, and a fair and impartial execution of the\nlaws made by it. But the state of mankind is not so miserable that they\nare not capable of using this remedy, till it be too late to look for\nany. To tell people they may provide for themselves, by erecting a new\nlegislative, when by oppression, artifice, or being delivered over to a\nforeign power, their old one is gone, is only to tell them, they may\nexpect relief when it is too late, and the evil is past cure. This is in\neffect no more than to bid them first be slaves, and then to take care\nof their liberty; and when their chains are on, tell them, they may act\nlike freemen. This, if barely so, is rather mockery than relief; and men\ncan never be secure from tyranny, if there be no means to escape it till\nthey are perfectly under it: and therefore it is, that they have not\nonly a right to get out of it, but to prevent it.\nSect. 221. There is therefore, secondly, another way whereby governments\nare dissolved, and that is, when the legislative, or the prince, either\nof them, act contrary to their trust.\nFirst, The legislative acts against the trust reposed in them, when they\nendeavour to invade the property of the subject, and to make themselves,\nor any part of the community, masters, or arbitrary disposers of the\nlives, liberties, or fortunes of the people.\nSect. 222. The reason why men enter into society, is the preservation of\ntheir property; and the end why they chuse and authorize a legislative,\nis, that there may be laws made, and rules set, as guards and fences to\nthe properties of all the members of the society, to limit the power,\nand moderate the dominion, of every part and member of the society: for\nsince it can never be supposed to be the will of the society, that the\nlegislative should have a power to destroy that which every one designs\nto secure, by entering into society, and for which the people submitted\nthemselves to legislators of their own making; whenever the legislators\nendeavour to take away, and destroy the property of the people, or to\nreduce them to slavery under arbitrary power, they put themselves into a\nstate of war with the people, who are thereupon absolved from any\nfarther obedience, and are left to the common refuge, which God hath\nprovided for all men, against force and violence. Whensoever therefore\nthe legislative shall transgress this fundamental rule of society; and\neither by ambition, fear, folly or corruption, endeavour to grasp\nthemselves, or put into the hands of any other, an absolute power over\nthe lives, liberties, and estates of the people; by this breach of trust\nthey forfeit the power the people had put into their hands for quite\ncontrary ends, and it devolves to the people, who have a right to resume\ntheir original liberty, and, by the establishment of a new legislative,\n(such as they shall think fit) provide for their own safety and\nsecurity, which is the end for which they are in society. What I have\nsaid here, concerning the legislative in general, holds true also\nconcerning the supreme executor, who having a double trust put in him,\nboth to have a part in the legislative, and the supreme execution of the\nlaw, acts against both, when he goes about to set up his own arbitrary\nwill as the law of the society. He acts also contrary to his trust, when\nhe either employs the force, treasure, and offices of the society, to\ncorrupt the representatives, and gain them to his purposes; or openly\npreengages the electors, and prescribes to their choice, such, whom he\nhas, by sollicitations, threats, promises, or otherwise, won to his\ndesigns; and employs them to bring in such, who have promised\nbefore-hand what to vote, and what to enact. Thus to regulate candidates\nand electors, and new-model the ways of election, what is it but to cut\nup the government by the roots, and poison the very fountain of public\nsecurity? for the people having reserved to themselves the choice of\ntheir representatives, as the fence to their properties, could do it for\nno other end, but that they might always be freely chosen, and so\nchosen, freely act, and advise, as the necessity of the commonwealth,\nand the public good should, upon examination, and mature debate, be\njudged to require. This, those who give their votes before they hear the\ndebate, and have weighed the reasons on all sides, are not capable of\ndoing. To prepare such an assembly as this, and endeavour to set up the\ndeclared abettors of his own will, for the true representatives of the\npeople, and the law-makers of the society, is certainly as great a\nbreach of trust, and as perfect a declaration of a design to subvert the\ngovernment, as is possible to be met with. To which, if one shall add\nrewards and punishments visibly employed to the same end, and all the\narts of perverted law made use of, to take off and destroy all that\nstand in the way of such a design, and will not comply and consent to\nbetray the liberties of their country, it will be past doubt what is\ndoing. What power they ought to have in the society, who thus employ it\ncontrary to the trust went along with it in its first institution, is\neasy to determine; and one cannot but see, that he, who has once\nattempted any such thing as this, cannot any longer be trusted.\nSect. 223. To this perhaps it will be said, that the people being\nignorant, and always discontented, to lay the foundation of government\nin the unsteady opinion and uncertain humour of the people, is to expose\nit to certain ruin; and no government will be able long to subsist, if\nthe people may set up a new legislative, whenever they take offence at\nthe old one. To this I answer, Quite the contrary. People are not so\neasily got out of their old forms, as some are apt to suggest. They are\nhardly to be prevailed with to amend the acknowledged faults in the\nframe they have been accustomed to. And if there be any original\ndefects, or adventitious ones introduced by time, or corruption; it is\nnot an easy thing to get them changed, even when all the world sees\nthere is an opportunity for it. This slowness and aversion in the people\nto quit their old constitutions, has, in the many revolutions which have\nbeen seen in this kingdom, in this and former ages, still kept us to,\nor, after some interval of fruitless attempts, still brought us back\nagain to our old legislative of king, lords and commons: and whatever\nprovocations have made the crown be taken from some of our princes\nheads, they never carried the people so far as to place it in another\nline.\nSect. 224. But it will be said, this hypothesis lays a ferment for\nfrequent rebellion. To which I answer,\nFirst, No more than any other hypothesis: for when the people are made\nmiserable, and find themselves exposed to the ill usage of arbitrary\npower, cry up their governors, as much as you will, for sons of Jupiter;\nlet them be sacred and divine, descended, or authorized from heaven;\ngive them out for whom or what you please, the same will happen. The\npeople generally ill treated, and contrary to right, will be ready upon\nany occasion to ease themselves of a burden that sits heavy upon them.\nThey will wish, and seek for the opportunity, which in the change,\nweakness and accidents of human affairs, seldom delays long to offer\nitself. He must have lived but a little while in the world, who has not\nseen examples of this in his time; and he must have read very little,\nwho cannot produce examples of it in all sorts of governments in the\nworld.\nSect. 225. Secondly, I answer, such revolutions happen not upon every\nlittle mismanagement in public affairs. Great mistakes in the ruling\npart, many wrong and inconvenient laws, and all the slips of human\nfrailty, will be born by the people without mutiny or murmur. But if a\nlong train of abuses, prevarications and artifices, all tending the same\nway, make the design visible to the people, and they cannot but feel\nwhat they lie under, and see whither they are going; it is not to be\nwondered, that they should then rouze themselves, and endeavour to put\nthe rule into such hands which may secure to them the ends for which\ngovernment was at first erected; and without which, ancient names, and\nspecious forms, are so far from being better, that they are much worse,\nthan the state of nature, or pure anarchy; the inconveniencies being all\nas great and as near, but the remedy farther off and more difficult.\nSect. 226. Thirdly, I answer, that this doctrine of a power in the\npeople of providing for their safety a-new, by a new legislative, when\ntheir legislators have acted contrary to their trust, by invading their\nproperty, is the best fence against rebellion, and the probablest means\nto hinder it: for rebellion being an opposition, not to persons, but\nauthority, which is founded only in the constitutions and laws of the\ngovernment; those, whoever they be, who by force break through, and by\nforce justify their violation of them, are truly and properly rebels:\nfor when men, by entering into society and civil-government, have\nexcluded force, and introduced laws for the preservation of property,\npeace, and unity amongst themselves, those who set up force again in\nopposition to the laws, do rebellare, that is, bring back again the\nstate of war, and are properly rebels: which they who are in power, (by\nthe pretence they have to authority, the temptation of force they have\nin their hands, and the flattery of those about them) being likeliest to\ndo; the properest way to prevent the evil, is to shew them the danger\nand injustice of it, who are under the greatest temptation to run into\nit.\nSect. 227. In both the fore-mentioned cases, when either the legislative\nis changed, or the legislators act contrary to the end for which they\nwere constituted; those who are guilty are guilty of rebellion: for if\nany one by force takes away the established legislative of any society,\nand the laws by them made, pursuant to their trust, he thereby takes\naway the umpirage, which every one had consented to, for a peaceable\ndecision of all their controversies, and a bar to the state of war\namongst them. They, who remove, or change the legislative, take away\nthis decisive power, which no body can have, but by the appointment and\nconsent of the people; and so destroying the authority which the people\ndid, and no body else can set up, and introducing a power which the\npeople hath not authorized, they actually introduce a state of war,\nwhich is that of force without authority: and thus, by removing the\nlegislative established by the society, (in whose decisions the people\nacquiesced and united, as to that of their own will) they untie the\nknot, and expose the people a-new to the state of war, And if those, who\nby force take away the legislative, are rebels, the legislators\nthemselves, as has been shewn, can be no less esteemed so; when they,\nwho were set up for the protection, and preservation of the people,\ntheir liberties and properties, shall by force invade and endeavour to\ntake them away; and so they putting themselves into a state of war with\nthose who made them the protectors and guardians of their peace, are\nproperly, and with the greatest aggravation, rebellantes, rebels.\nSect. 228. But if they, who say it lays a foundation for rebellion, mean\nthat it may occasion civil wars, or intestine broils, to tell the people\nthey are absolved from obedience when illegal attempts are made upon\ntheir liberties or properties, and may oppose the unlawful violence of\nthose who were their magistrates, when they invade their properties\ncontrary to the trust put in them; and that therefore this doctrine is\nnot to be allowed, being so destructive to the peace of the world: they\nmay as well say, upon the same ground, that honest men may not oppose\nrobbers or pirates, because this may occasion disorder or bloodshed. If\nany mischief come in such cases, it is not to be charged upon him who\ndefends his own right, but on him that invades his neighbours. If the\ninnocent honest man must quietly quit all he has, for peace sake, to him\nwho will lay violent hands upon it, I desire it may be considered, what\na kind of peace there will be in the world, which consists only in\nviolence and rapine; and which is to be maintained only for the benefit\nof robbers and oppressors. Who would not think it an admirable peace\nbetwix the mighty and the mean, when the lamb, without resistance,\nyielded his throat to be torn by the imperious wolf? Polyphemus\u2019s den\ngives us a perfect pattern of such a peace, and such a government,\nwherein Ulysses and his companions had nothing to do, but quietly to\nsuffer themselves to be devoured. And no doubt Ulysses, who was a\nprudent man, preached up passive obedience, and exhorted them to a quiet\nsubmission, by representing to them of what concernment peace was to\nmankind; and by shewing the inconveniences might happen, if they should\noffer to resist Polyphemus, who had now the power over them.\nSect. 229. The end of government is the good of mankind; and which is\nbest for mankind, that the people should be always exposed to the\nboundless will of tyranny, or that the rulers should be sometimes liable\nto be opposed, when they grow exorbitant in the use of their power, and\nemploy it for the destruction, and not the preservation of the\nproperties of their people?\nSect. 230. Nor let any one say, that mischief can arise from hence, as\noften as it shall please a busy head, or turbulent spirit, to desire the\nalteration of the government. It is true, such men may stir, whenever\nthey please; but it will be only to their own just ruin and perdition:\nfor till the mischief be grown general, and the ill designs of the\nrulers become visible, or their attempts sensible to the greater part,\nthe people, who are more disposed to suffer than right themselves by\nresistance, are not apt to stir. The examples of particular injustice,\nor oppression of here and there an unfortunate man, moves them not. But\nif they universally have a persuation, grounded upon manifest evidence,\nthat designs are carrying on against their liberties, and the general\ncourse and tendency of things cannot but give them strong suspicions of\nthe evil intention of their governors, who is to be blamed for it? Who\ncan help it, if they, who might avoid it, bring themselves into this\nsuspicion? Are the people to be blamed, if they have the sense of\nrational creatures, and can think of things no otherwise than as they\nfind and feel them? And is it not rather their fault, who put things\ninto such a posture, that they would not have them thought to be as they\nare? I grant, that the pride, ambition, and turbulency of private men\nhave sometimes caused great disorders in commonwealths, and factions\nhave been fatal to states and kingdoms. But whether the mischief hath\noftener begun in the peoples wantonness, and a desire to cast off the\nlawful authority of their rulers, or in the rulers insolence, and\nendeavours to get and exercise an arbitrary power over their people;\nwhether oppression, or disobedience, gave the first rise to the\ndisorder, I leave it to impartial history to determine. This I am sure,\nwhoever, either ruler or subject, by force goes about to invade the\nrights of either prince or people, and lays the foundation for\noverturning the constitution and frame of any just government, is highly\nguilty of the greatest crime, I think, a man is capable of, being to\nanswer for all those mischiefs of blood, rapine, and desolation, which\nthe breaking to pieces of governments bring on a country. And he who\ndoes it, is justly to be esteemed the common enemy and pest of mankind,\nand is to be treated accordingly.\nSect. 231. That subjects or foreigners, attempting by force on the\nproperties of any people, may be resisted with force, is agreed on all\nhands. But that magistrates, doing the same thing, may be resisted, hath\nof late been denied: as if those who had the greatest privileges and\nadvantages by the law, had thereby a power to break those laws, by which\nalone they were set in a better place than their brethren: whereas their\noffence is thereby the greater, both as being ungrateful for the greater\nshare they have by the law, and breaking also that trust, which is put\ninto their hands by their brethren.\nSect. 232. Whosoever uses force without right, as every one does in\nsociety, who does it without law, puts himself into a state of war with\nthose against whom he so uses it; and in that state all former ties are\ncancelled, all other rights cease, and every one has a right to defend\nhimself, and to resist the aggressor. This is so evident, that Barclay\nhimself, that great assertor of the power and sacredness of kings, is\nforced to confess, That it is lawful for the people, in some cases, to\nresist their king; and that too in a chapter, wherein he pretends to\nshew, that the divine law shuts up the people from all manner of\nrebellion. Whereby it is evident, even by his own doctrine, that, since\nthey may in some cases resist, all resisting of princes is not\nrebellion. His words are these. Quod siquis dicat, Ergone populus\ntyrannicae crudelitati & furori jugulum semper praebebit? Ergone\nmultitude civitates suas fame, ferro, & flamma vastari, seque, conjuges,\n& liberos fortunae ludibrio & tyranni libidini exponi, inque omnia vitae\npericula omnesque miserias & molestias a rege deduci patientur? Num\nillis quod omni animantium generi est a natura tributum, denegari debet,\nut sc. vim vi repellant, seseq; ab injuria, tueantur? Huic breviter\nresponsum sit, Populo universo negari defensionem, quae juris naturalis\nest, neque ultionem quae praeter naturam est adversus regem concedi\ndebere. Quapropter si rex non in singulares tantum personas aliquot\nprivatum odium exerceat, sed corpus etiam reipublicae, cujus ipse caput\nest, i.e. totum populum, vel insignem aliquam ejus partem immani &\nintoleranda saevitia seu tyrannide divexet; populo, quidem hoc casu\nresistendi ac tuendi se ab injuria potestas competit, sed tuendi se\ntantum, non enim in principem invadendi: & restituendae injuriae\nillatae, non recedendi a debita reverentia propter acceptam injuriam.\nPraesentem denique impetum propulsandi non vim praeteritam ulciscenti\njus habet. Horum enim alterum a natura est, ut vitam scilicet corpusque\ntueamur. Alterum vero contra naturam, ut inferior de superiori\nsupplicium sumat. Quod itaque populus malum, antequam factum sit,\nimpedire potest, ne fiat, id postquam factum est, in regem authorem\nsceleris vindicare non potest: populus igitur hoc amplius quam privatus\nquispiam habet: quod huic, vel ipsis adversariis judicibus, excepto\nBuchanano, nullum nisi in patientia remedium superest. Cum ille si\nintolerabilis tyrannus est (modicum enim ferre omnino debet) resistere\ncum reverentia possit, Barclay contra Monarchom. 1. iii. c. 8.\nIn English thus:\nSect. 233. But if any one should ask, Must the people then always lay\nthemselves open to the cruelty and rage of tyranny? Must they see their\ncities pillaged, and laid in ashes, their wives and children exposed to\nthe tyrant\u2019s lust and fury, and themselves and families reduced by their\nking to ruin, and all the miseries of want and oppression, and yet sit\nstill? Must men alone be debarred the common privilege of opposing force\nwith force, which nature allows so freely to all other creatures for\ntheir preservation from injury? I answer: Self-defence is a part of the\nlaw of nature; nor can it be denied the community, even against the king\nhimself: but to revenge themselves upon him, must by no means be allowed\nthem; it being not agreeable to that law. Wherefore if the king shall\nshew an hatred, not only to some particular persons, but sets himself\nagainst the body of the commonwealth, whereof he is the head, and\nshall, with intolerable ill usage, cruelly tyrannize over the whole, or\na considerable part of the people, in this case the people have a right\nto resist and defend themselves from injury: but it must be with this\ncaution, that they only defend themselves, but do not attack their\nprince: they may repair the damages received, but must not for any\nprovocation exceed the bounds of due reverence and respect. They may\nrepulse the present attempt, but must not revenge past violences: for it\nis natural for us to defend life and limb, but that an inferior should\npunish a superior, is against nature. The mischief which is designed\nthem, the people may prevent before it be done; but when it is done,\nthey must not revenge it on the king, though author of the villany. This\ntherefore is the privilege of the people in general, above what any\nprivate person hath; that particular men are allowed by our adversaries\nthemselves (Buchanan only excepted) to have no other remedy but\npatience; but the body of the people may with respect resist intolerable\ntyranny; for when it is but moderate, they ought to endure it.\nSect. 234. Thus far that great advocate of monarchical power allows of\nresistance.\nSect. 235. It is true, he has annexed two limitations to it, to no\npurpose:\nFirst, He says, it must be with reverence.\nSecondly, It must be without retribution, or punishment; and the reason\nhe gives is, because an inferior cannot punish a superior. First, How to\nresist force without striking again, or how to strike with reverence,\nwill need some skill to make intelligible. He that shall oppose an\nassault only with a shield to receive the blows, or in any more\nrespectful posture, without a sword in his hand, to abate the confidence\nand force of the assailant, will quickly be at an end of his resistance,\nand will find such a defence serve only to draw on himself the worse\nusage. This is as ridiculous a way of resisting, as juvenal thought it\nof fighting; ubi tu pulsas, ego vapulo tantum. And the success of the\ncombat will be unavoidably the same he there describes it:\n/*[4]\n-----Libertas pauperis haec est:\nPulsatus rogat, et pugnis concisus, adorat,\nUt liceat paucis cum dentibus inde reverti.\n*/\nThis will always be the event of such an imaginary resistance, where men\nmay not strike again. He therefore who may resist, must be allowed to\nstrike. And then let our author, or any body else, join a knock on the\nhead, or a cut on the face, with as much reverence and respect as he\nthinks fit. He that can reconcile blows and reverence, may, for aught I\nknow, desire for his pains, a civil, respectful cudgeling where-ever he\ncan meet with it.\nSecondly, As to his second, An inferior cannot punish a superior; that\nis true, generally speaking, whilst he is his superior. But to resist\nforce with force, being the state of war that levels the parties,\ncancels all former relation of reverence, respect, and superiority: and\nthen the odds that remains, is, that he, who opposes the unjust\nagressor, has this superiority over him, that he has a right, when he\nprevails, to punish the offender, both for the breach of the peace, and\nall the evils that followed upon it. Barclay therefore, in another\nplace, more coherently to himself, denies it to be lawful to resist a\nking in any case. But he there assigns two cases, whereby a king may\nun-king himself. His words are,\nQuid ergo, nulline casus incidere possunt quibus populo sese erigere\natque in regem impotentius dominantem arma capere & invadere jure suo\nsuaque authoritate liceat? Nulli certe quamdiu rex manet. Semper enim ex\ndivinis id obstat, Regem honorificato; & qui potestati resistit, Dei\nordinationi resisit: non alias igitur in eum populo potestas est quam si\nid committat propter quod ipso jure rex esse desinat. Tunc enim se ipse\nprincipatu exuit atque in privatis constituit liber: hoc modo populus &\nsuperior efficitur, reverso ad eum sc. jure illo quod ante regem\ninauguratum in interregno habuit. At sunt paucorum generum commissa\nejusmodi quae hunc effectum pariunt. At ego cum plurima animo\nperlustrem, duo tantum invenio, duos, inquam, casus quibus rex ipso\nfacto ex rege non regem se facit & omni honore & dignitate regali atque\nin subditos potestate destituit; quorum etiam meminit Winzerus. Horum\nunus est, Si regnum disperdat, quemadmodum de Nerone fertur, quod is\nnempe senatum populumque Romanum, atque adeo urbem ipsam ferro flammaque\nvastare, ac novas sibi sedes quaerere decrevisset. Et de Caligula, quod\npalam denunciarit se neque civem neque principem senatui amplius fore,\ninque animo habuerit interempto utriusque ordinis electissimo quoque\nAlexandriam commigrare, ac ut populum uno ictu interimeret, unam ei\ncervicem optavit. Talia cum rex aliquis meditator & molitur serio, omnem\nregnandi curam & animum ilico abjicit, ac proinde imperium in subditos\namittit, ut dominus servi pro derelicto habiti dominium.\nSect. 236. Alter casus est, Si rex in alicujus clientelam se contulit,\nac regnum quod liberum a majoribus & populo traditum accepit, alienae\nditioni mancipavit. Nam tunc quamvis forte non ea mente id agit populo\nplane ut incommodet: tamen quia quod praecipuum est regiae dignitatis\namifit, ut summus scilicet in regno secundum Deum sit, & solo Deo\ninferior, atque populum etiam totum ignorantem vel invitum, cujus\nlibertatem sartam & tectam conservare debuit, in alterius gentis\nditionem & potestatem dedidit; hac velut quadam regni ab alienatione\neffecit, ut nec quod ipse in regno imperium habuit retineat, nec in eum\ncui collatum voluit, juris quicquam transferat; atque ita eo facto\nliberum jam & suae potestatis populum relinquit, cujus rei exemplum unum\nannales Scotici suppeditant. Barclay contra Monarchom. 1. iii. c. 16.\nWhich in English runs thus:\nSect. 237. What then, can there no case happen wherein the people may of\nright, and by their own authority, help themselves, take arms, and set\nupon their king, imperiously domineering over them? None at all, whilst\nhe remains a king. Honour the king, and he that resists the power,\nresists the ordinance of God; are divine oracles that will never permit\nit, The people therefore can never come by a power over him, unless he\ndoes something that makes him cease to be a king: for then he divests\nhimself of his crown and dignity, and returns to the state of a private\nman, and the people become free and superior, the power which they had\nin the interregnum, before they crowned him king, devolving to them\nagain. But there are but few miscarriages which bring the matter to this\nstate. After considering it well on all sides, I can find but two. Two\ncases there are, I say, whereby a king, ipso facto, becomes no king, and\nloses all power and regal authority over his people; which are also\ntaken notice of by Winzerus.\nThe first is, If he endeavour to overturn the government, that is, if he\nhave a purpose and design to ruin the kingdom and commonwealth, as it is\nrecorded of Nero, that he resolved to cut off the senate and people of\nRome, lay the city waste with fire and sword, and then remove to some\nother place. And of Caligula, that he openly declared, that he would be\nno longer a head to the people or senate, and that he had it in his\nthoughts to cut off the worthiest men of both ranks, and then retire to\nAlexandria: and he wisht that the people had but one neck, that he might\ndispatch them all at a blow, Such designs as these, when any king\nharbours in his thoughts, and seriously promotes, he immediately gives\nup all care and thought of the commonwealth; and consequently forfeits\nthe power of governing his subjects, as a master does the dominion over\nhis slaves whom he hath abandoned.\nSect. 238. The other case is, When a king makes himself the dependent of\nanother, and subjects his kingdom which his ancestors left him, and the\npeople put free into his hands, to the dominion of another: for however\nperhaps it may not be his intention to prejudice the people; yet because\nhe has hereby lost the principal part of regal dignity, viz. to be next\nand immediately under God, supreme in his kingdom; and also because he\nbetrayed or forced his people, whose liberty he ought to have carefully\npreserved, into the power and dominion of a foreign nation. By this, as\nit were, alienation of his kingdom, he himself loses the power he had in\nit before, without transferring any the least right to those on whom he\nwould have bestowed it; and so by this act sets the people free, and\nleaves them at their own disposal. One example of this is to be found in\nthe Scotch Annals.\nSect. 239. In these cases Barclay, the great champion of absolute\nmonarchy, is forced to allow, that a king may be resisted, and ceases to\nbe a king. That is, in short, not to multiply cases, in whatsoever he\nhas no authority, there he is no king, and may be resisted: for\nwheresoever the authority ceases, the king ceases too, and becomes like\nother men who have no authority. And these two cases he instances in,\ndiffer little from those above mentioned, to be destructive to\ngovernments, only that he has omitted the principle from which his\ndoctrine flows: and that is, the breach of trust, in not preserving the\nform of government agreed on, and in not intending the end of government\nitself, which is the public good and preservation of property. When a\nking has dethroned himself, and put himself in a state of war with his\npeople, what shall hinder them from prosecuting him who is no king, as\nthey would any other man, who has put himself into a state of war with\nthem, Barclay, and those of his opinion, would do well to tell us. This\nfarther I desire may be taken notice of out of Barclay, that he says,\nThe mischief that is designed them, the people may prevent before it be\ndone: whereby he allows resistance when tyranny is but in design. Such\ndesigns as these (says he) when any king harbours in his thoughts and\nseriously promotes, he immediately gives up all care and thought of the\ncommonwealth; so that, according to him, the neglect of the public good\nis to be taken as an evidence of such design, or at least for a\nsufficient cause of resistance. And the reason of all, he gives in these\nwords, Because he betrayed or forced his people, whose liberty he ought\ncarefully to have preserved. What he adds, into the power and dominion\nof a foreign nation, signifies nothing, the fault and forfeiture lying\nin the loss of their liberty, which he ought to have preserved, and not\nin any distinction of the persons to whose dominion they were subjected.\nThe peoples right is equally invaded, and their liberty lost, whether\nthey are made slaves to any of their own, or a foreign nation; and in\nthis lies the injury, and against this only have they the right of\ndefence. And there are instances to be found in all countries, which\nshew, that it is not the change of nations in the persons of their\ngovernors, but the change of government, that gives the offence. Bilson,\na bishop of our church, and a great stickler for the power and\nprerogative of princes, does, if I mistake not, in his treatise of\nChristian subjection, acknowledge, that princes may forfeit their power,\nand their title to the obedience of their subjects; and if there needed\nauthority in a case where reason is so plain, I could send my reader to\nBracton, Fortescue, and the author of the Mirrour, and others, writers\nthat cannot be suspected to be ignorant of our government, or enemies to\nit. But I thought Hooker alone might be enough to satisfy those men, who\nrelying on him for their ecclesiastical polity, are by a strange fate\ncarried to deny those principles upon which he builds it. Whether they\nare herein made the tools of cunninger workmen, to pull down their own\nfabric, they were best look. This I am sure, their civil policy is so\nnew, so dangerous, and so destructive to both rulers and people, that as\nformer ages never could bear the broaching of it; so it may be hoped,\nthose to come, redeemed from the impositions of these Egyptian\nunder-task-masters, will abhor the memory of such servile flatterers,\nwho, whilst it seemed to serve their turn, resolved all government into\nabsolute tyranny, and would have all men born to, what their mean souls\nfitted them for, slavery.\nSect. 240. Here, it is like, the common question will be made, Who shall\nbe judge, whether the prince or legislative act contrary to their trust?\nThis, perhaps, ill-affected and factious men may spread amongst the\npeople, when the prince only makes use of his due prerogative. To this I\nreply, The people shall be judge; for who shall be judge whether his\ntrustee or deputy acts well, and according to the trust reposed in him,\nbut he who deputes him, and must, by having deputed him, have still a\npower to discard him, when he fails in his trust? If this be reasonable\nin particular cases of private men, why should it be otherwise in that\nof the greatest moment, where the welfare of millions is concerned, and\nalso where the evil, if not prevented, is greater, and the redress very\ndifficult, dear, and dangerous?\nSect. 241. But farther, this question, (Who shall be judge?) cannot\nmean, that there is no judge at all: for where there is no judicature on\nearth, to decide controversies amongst men, God in heaven is judge. He\nalone, it is true, is judge of the right. But every man is judge for\nhimself, as in all other cases, so in this, whether another hath put\nhimself into a state of war with him, and whether he should appeal to\nthe Supreme Judge, as Jeptha did.\nSect. 242. If a controversy arise betwixt a prince and some of the\npeople, in a matter where the law is silent, or doubtful, and the thing\nbe of great consequence, I should think the proper umpire, in such a\ncase, should be the body of the people: for in cases where the prince\nhath a trust reposed in him, and is dispensed from the common ordinary\nrules of the law; there, if any men find themselves aggrieved, and think\nthe prince acts contrary to, or beyond that trust, who so proper to\njudge as the body of the people, (who, at first, lodged that trust in\nhim) how far they meant it should extend? But if the prince, or whoever\nthey be in the administration, decline that way of determination, the\nappeal then lies no where but to heaven; force between either persons,\nwho have no known superior on earth, or which permits no appeal to a\njudge on earth, being properly a state of war, wherein the appeal lies\nonly to heaven; and in that state the injured party must judge for\nhimself, when he will think fit to make use of that appeal, and put\nhimself upon it.\nSect. 243. To conclude, The power that every individual gave the\nsociety, when he entered into it, can never revert to the individuals\nagain, as long as the society lasts, but will always remain in the\ncommunity; because without this there can be no community, no\ncommonwealth, which is contrary to the original agreement: so also when\nthe society hath placed the legislative in any assembly of men, to\ncontinue in them and their successors, with direction and authority for\nproviding such successors, the legislative can never revert to the\npeople whilst that government lasts; because having provided a\nlegislative with power to continue for ever, they have given up their\npolitical power to the legislative, and cannot resume it. But if they\nhave set limits to the duration of their legislative, and made this\nsupreme power in any person, or assembly, only temporary; or else, when\nby the miscarriages of those in authority, it is forfeited; upon the\nforfeiture, or at the determination of the time set, it reverts to the\nsociety, and the people have a right to act as supreme, and continue the\nlegislative in themselves; or erect a new form, or under the old form\nplace it in new hands, as they think good.\nFINIS.", "source": "second_treatise.txt"}

To use these sounds as Signs of Ideas.\nBesides articulate sounds, therefore, it was further necessary that he\nshould be able to use these sounds as signs of internal conceptions; and\nto make them stand as marks for the ideas within his own mind, whereby\nthey might be made known to others, and the thoughts of men's minds be\nconveyed from one to another.\n3. To make them general Signs.\nBut neither was this sufficient to make words so useful as they ought to\nbe. It is not enough for the perfection of language, that sounds can\nbe made signs of ideas, unless those signs can be so made use of as to\ncomprehend several particular things: for the multiplication of words\nwould have perplexed their use, had every particular thing need of\na distinct name to be signified by. [To remedy this inconvenience,\nlanguage had yet a further improvement in the use of GENERAL TERMS,\nwhereby one word was made to mark a multitude of particular existences:\nwhich advantageous use of sounds was obtained only by the difference of\nthe ideas they were made signs of: those names becoming general, which\nare made to stand for GENERAL IDEAS, and those remaining particular,\nwhere the IDEAS they are used for are PARTICULAR.]\n4. To make them signify the absence of positive Ideas.\nBesides these names which stand for ideas, there be other words which\nmen make use of, not to signify any idea, but the want or absence of\nsome ideas, simple or complex, or all ideas together; such as are NIHIL\nin Latin, and in English, IGNORANCE and BARRENNESS. All which negative\nor privative words cannot be said properly to belong to, or signify no\nideas: for then they would be perfectly insignificant sounds; but they\nrelate to positive ideas, and signify their absence.\n5. Words ultimately derived from such as signify sensible Ideas.\nIt may also lead us a little towards the original of all our notions and\nknowledge, if we remark how great a dependence our words have on common\nsensible ideas; and how those which are made use of to stand for actions\nand notions quite removed from sense, have their rise from thence, and\nfrom obvious sensible ideas are transferred to more abstruse\nsignifications, and made to stand for ideas that come not under the\ncognizance of our senses; v.g. to IMAGINE, APPREHEND, COMPREHEND,\nADHERE, CONCEIVE, INSTIL, DISGUST, DISTURBANCE, TRANQUILLITY, &c., are\nall words taken from the operations of sensible things, and applied to\ncertain modes of thinking. SPIRIT, in its primary signification, is\nbreath; ANGEL, a messenger: and I doubt not but, if we could trace them\nto their sources, we should find, in all languages, the names which\nstand for things that fall not under our senses to have had their first\nrise from sensible ideas. By which we may give some kind of guess what\nkind of notions they were, and whence derived, which filled their minds\nwho were the first beginners of languages, and how nature, even in the\nnaming of things, unawares suggested to men the originals and principles\nof all their knowledge: whilst, to give names that might make known to\nothers any operations they felt in themselves, or any other ideas that\ncame not under their senses, they were fain to borrow words from\nordinary known ideas of sensation, by that means to make others the more\neasily to conceive those operations they experimented in themselves,\nwhich made no outward sensible appearances; and then, when they had got\nknown and agreed names to signify those internal operations of their own\nminds, they were sufficiently furnished to make known by words all their\nother ideas; since they could consist of nothing but either of outward\nsensible perceptions, or of the inward operations of their minds about\nthem; we having, as has been proved, no ideas at all, but what\noriginally come either from sensible objects without, or what we feel\nwithin ourselves, from the inward workings of our own spirits, of which\nwe are conscious to ourselves within.\n6. Distribution of subjects to be treated of.\nBut to understand better the use and force of Language, as subservient\nto instruction and knowledge, it will be convenient to consider:\nFirst, TO WHAT IT IS THAT NAMES, IN THE USE OF LANGUAGE, ARE IMMEDIATELY\nAPPLIED.\nSecondly, Since all (except proper) names are general, and so stand not\nparticularly for this or that single thing, but for sorts and ranks of\nthings, it will be necessary to consider, in the next place, what the\nsorts and kinds, or, if you rather like the Latin names, WHAT THE\nSPECIES AND GENERA OF THINGS ARE, WHEREIN THEY CONSIST, AND HOW THEY\nCOME TO BE MADE. These being (as they ought) well looked into, we shall\nthe better come to find the right use of words; the natural advantages\nand defects of language; and the remedies that ought to be used,\nto avoid the inconveniences of obscurity or uncertainty in the\nsignification of words: without which it is impossible to discourse with\nany clearness or order concerning knowledge: which, being conversant\nabout propositions, and those most commonly universal ones, has greater\nconnexion with words than perhaps is suspected. These considerations,\ntherefore, shall be the matter of the following chapters.\nCHAPTER II.\nOF THE SIGNIFICATION OF WORDS.\n1. Words are sensible Signs, necessary for Communication of Ideas.\nMan, though he have great variety of thoughts, and such from which\nothers as well as himself might receive profit and delight; yet they are\nall within his own breast, invisible and hidden from others, nor can of\nthemselves be made to appear. The comfort and advantage of society not\nbeing to be had without communication of thoughts, it was necessary\nthat man should find out some external sensible signs, whereof those\ninvisible ideas, which his thoughts are made up of, might be made known\nto others. For this purpose nothing was so fit, either for plenty or\nquickness, as those articulate sounds, which with so much ease and\nvariety he found himself able to make. Thus we may conceive how WORDS,\nwhich were by nature so well adapted to that purpose, came to be made\nuse of by men as the signs of their ideas; not by any natural connexion\nthat there is between particular articulate sounds and certain ideas,\nfor then there would be but one language amongst all men; but by a\nvoluntary imposition, whereby such a word is made arbitrarily the mark\nof such an idea. The use, then, of words, is to be sensible marks of\nideas; and the ideas they stand for are their proper and immediate\nsignification.\n2. Words, in their immediate Signification, are the sensible Signs of\nhis Ideas who uses them.\nThe use men have of these marks being either to record their own\nthoughts, for the assistance of their own memory; or, as it were, to\nbring out their ideas, and lay them before the view of others: words,\nin their primary or immediate signification, stand for nothing but THE\nIDEAS IN THE MIND OF HIM THAT USES THEM, how imperfectly soever or\ncarelessly those ideas are collected from the things which they are\nsupposed to represent. When a man speaks to another, it is that he may\nbe understood: and the end of speech is, that those sounds, as marks,\nmay make known his ideas to the hearer. That then which words are the\nmarks of are the ideas of the speaker: nor can any one apply them as\nmarks, immediately, to anything else but the ideas that he himself hath:\nfor this would be to make them signs of his own conceptions, and yet\napply them to other ideas; which would be to make them signs and not\nsigns of his ideas at the same time; and so in effect to have no\nsignification at all. Words being voluntary signs, they cannot be\nvoluntary signs imposed by him on things he knows not. That would be to\nmake them signs of nothing, sounds without signification. A man\ncannot make his words the signs either of qualities in things, or of\nconceptions in the mind of another, whereof he has none in his own. Till\nhe has some ideas of his own, he cannot suppose them to correspond with\nthe conceptions of another man; nor can he use any signs for them: for\nthus they would be the signs of he knows not what, which is in truth to\nbe the signs of nothing. But when he represents to himself other men's\nideas by some of his own, if he consent to give them the same names that\nother men do, it is still to his own ideas; to ideas that he has, and\nnot to ideas that he has not.\n3. Examples of this.\nThis is so necessary in the use of language, that in this respect the\nknowing and the ignorant, the learned and the unlearned, use the words\nthey speak (with any meaning) all alike. They, in every man's mouth,\nstand for the ideas he has, and which he would express by them. A child\nhaving taken notice of nothing in the metal he hears called GOLD, but\nthe bright shining yellow colour, he applies the word gold only to his\nown idea of that colour, and nothing else; and therefore calls the same\ncolour in a peacock's tail gold. Another that hath better observed, adds\nto shining yellow great weight: and then the sound gold, when he uses\nit, stands for a complex idea of a shining yellow and a very weighty\nsubstance. Another adds to those qualities fusibility: and then the word\ngold signifies to him a body, bright, yellow, fusible, and very heavy.\nAnother adds malleability. Each of these uses equally the word gold,\nwhen they have occasion to express the idea which they have applied it\nto: but it is evident that each can apply it only to his own idea; nor\ncan he make it stand as a sign of such a complex idea as he has not.\n4. Words are often secretly referred, First to the Ideas supposed to be\nin other men's minds.\nBut though words, as they are used by men, can properly and immediately\nsignify nothing but the ideas that are in the mind of the speaker; yet\nthey in their thoughts give them a secret reference to two other things.\nFirst, THEY SUPPOSE THEIR WORDS TO BE MARKS OF THE IDEAS IN THE MINDS\nALSO OF OTHER MEN, WITH WHOM THEY COMMUNICATE; for else they should talk\nin vain, and could not be understood, if the sounds they applied to one\nidea were such as by the hearer were applied to another, which is to\nspeak two languages. But in this men stand not usually to examine,\nwhether the idea they, and those they discourse with have in their\nminds be the same: but think it enough that they use the word, as they\nimagine, in the common acceptation of that language; in which they\nsuppose that the idea they make it a sign of is precisely the same to\nwhich the understanding men of that country apply that name.\n5. Secondly, to the Reality of Things.\nSecondly, Because men would not be thought to talk barely of their own\nimagination, but of things as really they are; therefore they often\nsuppose the WORDS TO STAND ALSO FOR THE REALITY OF THINGS. But this\nrelating more particularly to substances and their names, as perhaps\nthe former does to simple ideas and modes, we shall speak of these two\ndifferent ways of applying words more at large, when we come to treat of\nthe names of mixed modes and substances in particular: though give me\nleave here to say, that it is a perverting the use of words, and brings\nunavoidable obscurity and confusion into their signification, whenever\nwe make them stand for anything but those ideas we have in our own\nminds.\n6. Words by Use readily excite Ideas of their objects.\nConcerning words, also, it is further to be considered:\nFirst, that they being immediately the signs of men's ideas, and by that\nmeans the instruments whereby men communicate their conceptions, and\nexpress to one another those thoughts and imaginations they have within\ntheir own breasts; there comes, by constant use, to be such a connexion\nbetween certain sounds and the ideas they stand for, that the names\nheard, almost as readily excite certain ideas as if the objects\nthemselves, which are apt to produce them, did actually affect the\nsenses. Which is manifestly so in all obvious sensible qualities, and in\nall substances that frequently and familiarly occur to us.\n7. Words are often used without Signification, and Why.\nSecondly, That though the proper and immediate signification of words\nare ideas in the mind of the speaker, yet, because by familiar use from\nour cradles, we come to learn certain articulate sounds very perfectly,\nand have them readily on our tongues, and always at hand in our\nmemories, but yet are not always careful to examine or settle their\nsignifications perfectly; it often happens that men, even when they\nwould apply themselves to an attentive consideration, do set their\nthoughts more on words than things. Nay, because words are many of them\nlearned before the ideas are known for which they stand: therefore some,\nnot only children but men, speak several words no otherwise than parrots\ndo, only because they have learned them, and have been accustomed to\nthose sounds. But so far as words are of use and signification, so far\nis there a constant connexion between the sound and the idea, and a\ndesignation that the one stands for the other; without which application\nof them, they are nothing but so much insignificant noise.\n8. Their Signification perfectly arbitrary, not the consequence of a\nnatural connexion.\nWords, by long and familiar use, as has been said, come to excite in men\ncertain ideas so constantly and readily, that they are apt to suppose\na natural connexion between them. But that they signify only men's\npeculiar ideas, and that BY A PERFECT ARBITRARY IMPOSITION, is evident,\nin that they often fail to excite in others (even that use the same\nlanguage) the same ideas we take them to be signs of: and every man has\nso inviolable a liberty to make words stand for what ideas he pleases,\nthat no one hath the power to make others have the same ideas in their\nminds that he has, when they use the same words that he does. And\ntherefore the great Augustus himself, in the possession of that power\nwhich ruled the world, acknowledged he could not make a new Latin word:\nwhich was as much as to say, that he could not arbitrarily appoint what\nidea any sound should be a sign of, in the mouths and common language of\nhis subjects. It is true, common use, by a tacit consent, appropriates\ncertain sounds to certain ideas in all languages, which so far limits\nthe signification of that sound, that unless a man applies it to the\nsame idea, he does not speak properly: and let me add, that unless a\nman's words excite the same ideas in the hearer which he makes them\nstand for in speaking, he does not speak intelligibly. But whatever be\nthe consequence of any man's using of words differently, either from\ntheir general meaning, or the particular sense of the person to whom\nhe addresses them; this is certain, their signification, in his use of\nthem, is limited to his ideas, and they can be signs of nothing else.\nCHAPTER III.\nOF GENERAL TERMS.\n1. The greatest Part of Words are general terms.\nAll things that exist being particulars, it may perhaps be thought\nreasonable that words, which ought to be conformed to things, should\nbe so too,--I mean in their signification: but yet we find quite the\ncontrary. The far greatest part of words that make all languages are\ngeneral terms: which has not been the effect of neglect or chance, but\nof reason and necessity.\n2. That every particular Thing should have a Name for itself is\nimpossible.\nFirst, It is impossible that every particular thing should have a\ndistinct peculiar name. For, the signification and use of words\ndepending on that connexion which the mind makes between its ideas and\nthe sounds it uses as signs of them, it is necessary, in the application\nof names to things, that the mind should have distinct ideas of the\nthings, and retain also the particular name that belongs to every one,\nwith its peculiar appropriation to that idea. But it is beyond the\npower of human capacity to frame and retain distinct ideas of all the\nparticular things we meet with: every bird and beast men saw; every tree\nand plant that affected the senses, could not find a place in the\nmost capacious understanding. If it be looked on as an instance of a\nprodigious memory, that some generals have been able to call every\nsoldier in their army by his proper name, we may easily find a reason\nwhy men have never attempted to give names to each sheep in their flock,\nor crow that flies over their heads; much less to call every leaf of\nplants, or grain of sand that came in their way, by a peculiar name.\n3. And would be useless, if it were possible.\nSecondly, If it were possible, it would yet be useless; because it would\nnot serve to the chief end of language. Men would in vain heap up names\nof particular things, that would not serve them to communicate their\nthoughts. Men learn names, and use them in talk with others, only that\nthey may be understood: which is then only done when, by use or consent,\nthe sound I make by the organs of speech, excites in another man's mind\nwho hears it, the idea I apply it to in mine, when I speak it. This\ncannot be done by names applied to particular things; whereof I alone\nhaving the ideas in my mind, the names of them could not be significant\nor intelligible to another, who was not acquainted with all those very\nparticular things which had fallen under my notice.\n4. A distinct name for every particular thing not fitted for enlargement\nof knowledge.\nThirdly, But yet, granting this also feasible, (which I think is not,)\nyet a distinct name for every particular thing would not be of any\ngreat use for the improvement of knowledge: which, though founded in\nparticular things, enlarges itself by general views; to which things\nreduced into sorts, under general names, are properly subservient.\nThese, with the names belonging to them, come within some compass, and\ndo not multiply every moment, beyond what either the mind can contain,\nor use requires. And therefore, in these, men have for the most part\nstopped: but yet not so as to hinder themselves from distinguishing\nparticular things by appropriated names, where convenience demands it.\nAnd therefore in their own species, which they have most to do with, and\nwherein they have often occasion to mention particular persons, they\nmake use of proper names; and there distinct individuals have distinct\ndenominations.\n5. What things have proper Names, and why.\nBesides persons, countries also, cities, rivers, mountains, and other\nthe like distinctions of place have usually found peculiar names, and\nthat for the same reason; they being such as men have often as occasion\nto mark particularly, and, as it were, set before others in their\ndiscourses with them. And I doubt not but, if we had reason to mention\nparticular horses as often as as have reason to mention particular men,\nwe should have proper names for the one, as familiar as for the other,\nand Bucephalus would be a word as much in use as Alexander. And\ntherefore we see that, amongst jockeys, horses have their proper names\nto be known and distinguished by, as commonly as their servants:\nbecause, amongst them, there is often occasion to mention this or that\nparticular horse when he is out of sight.\n6. How general Words are made.\nThe next thing to be considered is,--How general words come to be made.\nFor, since all things that exist are only particulars, how come we by\ngeneral terms; or where find we those general natures they are supposed\nto stand for? Words become general by being made the signs of\ngeneral ideas: and ideas become general, by separating from them the\ncircumstances of time and place, and any other ideas that may determine\nthem to this or that particular existence. By this way of abstraction\nthey are made capable of representing more individuals than one; each of\nwhich having in it a conformity to that abstract idea, is (as we call\nit) of that sort.\n7. Shown by the way we enlarge our complex ideas from infancy.\nBut, to deduce this a little more distinctly, it will not perhaps be\namiss to trace our notions and names from their beginning, and observe\nby what degrees we proceed, and by what steps we enlarge our ideas from\nour first infancy. There is nothing more evident, than that the ideas of\nthe persons children converse with (to instance in them alone) are, like\nthe persons themselves, only particular. The ideas of the nurse and the\nmother are well framed in their minds; and, like pictures of them there,\nrepresent only those individuals. The names they first gave to them are\nconfined to these individuals; and the names of NURSE and MAMMA, the\nchild uses, determine themselves to those persons. Afterwards, when time\nand a larger acquaintance have made them observe that there are a great\nmany other things in the world, that in some common agreements of shape,\nand several other qualities, resemble their father and mother, and those\npersons they have been used to, they frame an idea, which they find\nthose many particulars do partake in; and to that they give, with\nothers, the name MAN, for example. And thus they come to have a general\nname, and a general idea. Wherein they make nothing new; but only leave\nout of the complex idea they had of Peter and James, Mary and Jane, that\nwhich is peculiar to each, and retain only what is common to them all.\n8. And further enlarge our complex ideas, by still leaving out\nproperties contained in them.\nBy the same way that they come by the general name and idea of MAN, they\neasily advance to more general names and notions. For, observing that\nseveral things that differ from their idea of man, and cannot therefore\nbe comprehended out under that name, have yet certain qualities wherein\nthey agree with man, by retaining only those qualities, and uniting them\ninto one idea, they have again another and more general idea; to which\nhaving given a name they make a term of a more comprehensive extension:\nwhich new idea is made, not by any new addition, but only as before, by\nleaving out the shape, and some other properties signified by the name\nman, and retaining only a body, with life, sense, and spontaneous\nmotion, comprehended under the name animal.\n9. General natures are nothing but abstract and partial ideas of more\ncomplex ones.\nThat this is the way whereby men first formed general ideas, and general\nnames to them, I think is so evident, that there needs no other proof\nof it but the considering of a man's self, or others, and the ordinary\nproceedings of their minds in knowledge. And he that thinks GENERAL\nNATURES or NOTIONS are anything else but such abstract and partial ideas\nof more complex ones, taken at first from particular existences, will, I\nfear, be at a loss where to find them. For let any one effect, and then\ntell me, wherein does his idea of MAN differ from that of PETER and\nPAUL, or his idea of HORSE from that of BUCEPHALUS, but in the leaving\nout something that is peculiar to each individual, and retaining so much\nof those particular complex ideas of several particular existences as\nthey are found to agree in? Of the complex ideas signified by the names\nMAN and HORSE, leaving out but those particulars wherein they differ,\nand retaining only those wherein they agree, and of those making a new\ndistinct complex idea, and giving the name ANIMAL to it, one has a more\ngeneral term, that comprehends with man several other creatures. Leave\nout of the idea of ANIMAL, sense and spontaneous motion, and the\nremaining complex idea, made up of the remaining simple ones of body,\nlife, and nourishment, becomes a more general one, under the more\ncomprehensive term, VIVENS. And, not to dwell longer upon this\nparticular, so evident in itself; by the same way the mind proceeds to\nBODY, SUBSTANCE, and at last to BEING, THING, and such universal terms,\nwhich stand for any of our ideas whatsoever. To conclude: this whole\nmystery of genera and species, which make such a noise in the schools,\nand are with justice so little regarded out of them, is nothing else but\nABSTRACT IDEAS, more or less comprehensive, with names annexed to them.\nIn all which this is constant and unvariable, That every more general\nterm stands for such an idea, and is but a part of any of those\ncontained under it.\n10. Why the Genus is ordinarily made Use of in Definitions.\nThis may show us the reason why, in the defining of words, which is\nnothing but declaring their signification, we make use of the GENUS, or\nnext general word that comprehends it. Which is not out of necessity,\nbut only to save the labour of enumerating the several simple ideas\nwhich the next general word or GENUS stands for; or, perhaps, sometimes\nthe shame of not being able to do it. But though defining by GENUS and\nDIFFERENTIA (I crave leave to use these terms of art, though originally\nLatin, since they most properly suit those notions they are applied to),\nI say, though defining by the GENUS be the shortest way, yet I think it\nmay be doubted whether it be the best. This I am sure, it is not the\nonly, and so not absolutely necessary. For, definition being nothing but\nmaking another understand by words what idea the term defined stands\nfor, a definition is best made by enumerating those simple ideas that\nare combined in the signification of the term defined: and if, instead\nof such an enumeration, men have accustomed themselves to use the\nnext general term, it has not been out of necessity, or for greater\nclearness, but for quickness and dispatch sake. For I think that, to one\nwho desired to know what idea the word MAN stood for; if it should be\nsaid, that man was a solid extended substance, having life, sense,\nspontaneous motion, and the faculty of reasoning, I doubt not but the\nmeaning of the term man would be as well understood, and the idea it\nstands for be at least as clearly made known, as when it is defined\nto be a rational animal: which, by the several definitions of ANIMAL,\nVIVENS, and CORPUS, resolves itself into those enumerated ideas. I have,\nin explaining the term MAN, followed here the ordinary definition of\nthe schools; which, though perhaps not the most, exact, yet serves well\nenough to my present purpose. And one may, in this instance, see what\ngave occasion to the rule, that a definition must consist of GENUS and\nDIFFERENTIA; and it suffices to show us the little necessity there is\nof such a rule, or advantage in the strict observing of it. For,\ndefinitions, as has been said, being only the explaining of one word\nby several others, so that the meaning or idea it stands for may be\ncertainly known; languages are not always so made according to the rules\nof logic, that every term can have its signification exactly and clearly\nexpressed by two others. Experience sufficiently satisfies us to the\ncontrary; or else those who have made this rule have done ill, that they\nhave given us so few definitions conformable to it. But of definitions\nmore in the next chapter.\n11. General and Universal are Creatures of the Understanding, and belong\nnot to the Real Existence of things.\nTo return to general words: it is plain, by what has been said, that\nGENERAL and UNIVERSAL belong not to the real existence of things; but\nare the inventions and creatures of the understanding, made by it for\nits own use, and concern only signs, whether words or ideas. Words are\ngeneral, as has been said, when used for signs of general ideas, and so\nare applicable indifferently to many particular things; and ideas are\ngeneral when they are set up as the representatives of many particular\nthings: but universality belongs not to things themselves, which are all\nof them particular in their existence, even those words and ideas which\nin their signification are general. When therefore we quit particulars,\nthe generals that rest are only creatures of our own making; their\ngeneral nature being nothing but the capacity they are put into, by the\nunderstanding, of signifying or representing many particulars. For the\nsignification they have is nothing but a relation that, by the mind of\nman, is added to them.\n12. Abstract Ideas are the Essences of Genera and Species.\nThe next thing therefore to be considered is, What kind of signification\nit is that general words have. For, as it is evident that they do not\nsignify barely one particular thing; for then they would not be general\nterms, but proper names, so, on the other side, it is as evident they do\nnot signify a plurality; for MAN and MEN would then signify the same;\nand the distinction of numbers (as the grammarians call them) would be\nsuperfluous and useless. That then which general words signify is a SORT\nof things; and each of them does that, by being a sign of an abstract\nidea in the mind; to which idea, as things existing are found to agree,\nso they come to be ranked under that name, or, which is all one, be of\nthat sort. Whereby it is evident that the ESSENCES of the sorts, or, if\nthe Latin word pleases better, SPECIES of things, are nothing else but\nthese abstract ideas. For the having the essence of any species, being\nthat which makes anything to be of that species; and the conformity to\nthe idea to which the name is annexed being that which gives a right to\nthat name; the having the essence, and the having that conformity, must\nneeds be the same thing: since to be of any species, and to have a right\nto the name of that species, is all one. As, for example, to be a MAN,\nor of the SPECIES man, and to have right to the NAME man, is the same\nthing. Again, to be a man, or of the species man, and have the ESSENCE\nof a man, is the same thing. Now, since nothing can be a man, or have a\nright to the name man, but what has a conformity to the abstract idea\nthe name man stands for, nor anything be a man, or have a right to the\nspecies man, but what has the essence of that species; it follows, that\nthe abstract idea for which the name stands, and the essence of the\nspecies, is one and the same. From whence it is easy to observe, that\nthe essences of the sorts of things, and, consequently, the sorting of\nthings, is the workmanship of the understanding that abstracts and makes\nthose general ideas.\n13. They are the Workmanship of the Understanding, but have their\nFoundation in the Similitude of Things.\nI would not here be thought to forget, much less to deny, that Nature,\nin the production of things, makes several of them alike: there is\nnothing more obvious, especially in the races of animals, and all things\npropagated by seed. But yet I think we may say, THE SORTING OF THEM\nUNDER NAMES IS THE WORKMANSHIP OF THE UNDERSTANDING, TAKING OCCASION,\nFROM THE SIMILITUDE IT OBSERVES AMONGST THEM, TO MAKE ABSTRACT GENERAL\nIDEAS, and set them up in the mind, with names annexed to them, as\npatterns or forms, (for, in that sense, the word FORM has a very proper\nsignification,) to which as particular things existing are found to\nagree, so they come to be of that species, have that denomination, or\nare put into that CLASSIS. For when we say this is a man, that a horse;\nthis justice, that cruelty; this a watch, that a jack; what do we else\nbut rank things under different specific names, as agreeing to those\nabstract ideas, of which we have made those names the signs? And what\nare the essences of those species set out and marked by names, but those\nabstract ideas in the mind; which are, as it were, the bonds between\nparticular things that exist, and the names they are to be ranked under?\nAnd when general names have any connexion with particular beings, these\nabstract ideas are the medium that unites them: so that the essences of\nspecies, as distinguished and denominated by us, neither are nor can\nbe anything but those precise abstract ideas we have in our minds. And\ntherefore the supposed real essences of substances, if different from\nour abstract ideas, cannot be the essences of the species WE rank\nthings into. For two species may be one, as rationally as two different\nessences be the essence of one species: and I demand what are the\nalterations [which] may, or may not be made in a HORSE or LEAD, without\nmaking either of them to be of another species? In determining the\nspecies of things by OUR abstract ideas, this is easy to resolve: but if\nany one will regulate himself herein by supposed REAL essences, he will\nI suppose, be at a loss: and he will never be able to know when anything\nprecisely ceases to be of the species of a HORSE or LEAD.\n14. Each distinct abstract Idea is a distinct Essence.\nNor will any one wonder that I say these essences, or abstract ideas\n(which are the measures of name, and the boundaries of species) are\nthe workmanship of the understanding, who considers that at least the\ncomplex ones are often, in several men, different collections of simple\nideas; and therefore that is COVETOUSNESS to one man, which is not so to\nanother. Nay, even in substances, where their abstract ideas seem to be\ntaken from the things themselves, they are not constantly the same; no,\nnot in that species which is most familiar to us, and with which we have\nthe most intimate acquaintance: it having been more than once doubted,\nwhether the FOETUS born of a woman were a MAN, even so far as that it\nhath been debated, whether it were or were not to be nourished and\nbaptized: which could not be, if the abstract idea or essence to\nwhich the name man belonged were of nature's making; and were not\nthe uncertain and various collection of simple ideas, which the\nunderstanding put together, and then, abstracting it, affixed a name\nto it. So that, in truth, every distinct abstract idea is a distinct\nessence; and the names that stand for such distinct ideas are the\nnames of things essentially different. Thus a circle is as essentially\ndifferent from an oval as a sheep from a goat; and rain is as\nessentially different from snow as water from earth: that abstract idea\nwhich is the essence of one being impossible to be communicated to the\nother. And thus any two abstract ideas, that in any part vary one\nfrom another, with two distinct names annexed to them, constitute two\ndistinct sorts, or, if you please, SPECIES, as essentially different as\nany two of the most remote or opposite in the world.\n15. Several significations of the word Essence.\nBut since the essences of things are thought by some (and not without\nreason) to be wholly unknown, it may not be amiss to consider the\nseveral significations of the word ESSENCE.\nReal essences.\nFirst, Essence may be taken for the very being of anything, whereby it\nis what it is. And thus the real internal, but generally (in substances)\nunknown constitution of things, whereon their discoverable qualities\ndepend, may be called their essence. This is the proper original\nsignification of the word, as is evident from the formation of it;\nessential in its primary notation, signifying properly, being. And in\nthis sense it is still used, when we speak of the essence of PARTICULAR\nthings, without giving them any name.\nNominal Essences.\nSecondly, The learning and disputes of the schools having been much\nbusied about genus and species, the word essence has almost lost its\nprimary signification: and, instead of the real constitution of things,\nhas been almost wholly applied to the artificial constitution of\ngenus and species. It is true, there is ordinarily supposed a real\nconstitution of the sorts of things; and it is past doubt there must\nbe some real constitution, on which any collection of simple ideas\nco-existing must depend. But, it being evident that things are ranked\nunder names into sorts or species, only as they agree to certain\nabstract ideas, to which we have annexed those names, the essence of\neach GENUS, or sort, comes to be nothing but that abstract idea which\nthe general, or sortal (if I may have leave so to call it from sort, as\nI do general from genus,) name stands for. And this we shall find to be\nthat which the word essence imports in its most familiar use.\nThese two sorts of essences, I suppose, may not unfitly be termed, the\none the REAL, the other NOMINAL ESSENCE.\n16. Constant Connexion between the Name and nominal Essence.\nBetween the NOMINAL ESSENCE and the NAME there is so near a connexion,\nthat the name of any sort of things cannot be attributed to any\nparticular being but what has this essence, whereby it answers that\nabstract idea whereof that name is the sign.\n17. Supposition, that Species are distinguished by their real Essences\nuseless.\nConcerning the REAL ESSENCES of corporeal substances (to mention these\nonly) there are, if I mistake not, two opinions. The one is of those\nwho, using the word essence for they know not what, suppose a certain\nnumber of those essences, according to which all natural things are\nmade, and wherein they do exactly every one of them partake, and so\nbecome of this or that species. The other and more rational opinion is\nof those who look on all natural things to have a real, but unknown,\nconstitution of their insensible parts; from which flow those sensible\nqualities which serve us to distinguish them one from another, according\nas we have occasion to rank them into sorts, under common denominations.\nThe former of these opinions, which supposes these essences as a certain\nnumber of forms or moulds, wherein all natural things that exist are\ncast, and do equally partake, has, I imagine, very much perplexed the\nknowledge of natural things. The frequent productions of monsters, in\nall the species of animals, and of changelings, and other strange issues\nof human birth, carry with them difficulties, not possible to consist\nwith this hypothesis; since it is as impossible that two things\npartaking exactly of the same real essence should have different\nproperties, as that two figures partaking of the same real essence of a\ncircle should have different properties. But were there no other reason\nagainst it, yet the supposition of essences that cannot be known; and\nthe making of them, nevertheless, to be that which distinguishes the\nspecies of things, is so wholly useless and unserviceable to any part of\nour knowledge, that that alone were sufficient to make us lay it by, and\ncontent ourselves with such essences of the sorts or species of things\nas come within the reach of our knowledge: which, when seriously\nconsidered, will be found, as I have said, to be nothing else but, those\nABSTRACT complex ideas to which we have annexed distinct general names.\n18. Real and nominal Essence\nEssences being thus distinguished into nominal and real, we may further\nobserve, that, in the species of simple ideas and modes, they are always\nthe same; but in substances always quite different. Thus, a figure\nincluding a space between three lines, is the real as well as nominal\nessence of a triangle; it being not only the abstract idea to which the\ngeneral name is annexed, but the very ESSENTIA or being of the thing\nitself; that foundation from which all its properties flow, and to which\nthey are all inseparably annexed. But it is far otherwise concerning\nthat parcel of matter which makes the ring on my finger; wherein these\ntwo essences are apparently different. For, it is the real constitution\nof its insensible parts, on which depend all those properties of colour,\nweight, fusibility, fixedness, &c., which are to be found in it; which\nconstitution we know not, and so, having no particular idea of, having\nno name that is the sign of it. But yet it is its colour, weight,\nfusibility, fixedness, &c., which makes it to be gold, or gives it\na right to that name, which is therefore its nominal essence. Since\nnothing can be called gold but what has a conformity of qualities to\nthat abstract complex idea to which that name is annexed. But this\ndistinction of essences, belonging particularly to substances, we shall,\nwhen we come to consider their names, have an occasion to treat of more\nfully.\n19. Essences ingenerable and incorruptible.\nThat such abstract ideas, with names to them, as we have been speaking\nof are essences, may further appear by what we are told concerning\nessences, viz. that they are all ingenerable and incorruptible. Which\ncannot be true of the real constitutions of things, which begin and\nperish with them. All things that exist, besides their Author, are all\nliable to change; especially those things we are acquainted with, and\nhave ranked into bands under distinct names or ensigns. Thus, that which\nwas grass to-day is to-morrow the flesh of a sheep; and, within a few\ndays after, becomes part of a man: in all which and the like changes,\nit is evident their real essence--i. e. that constitution whereon the\nproperties of these several things depended--is destroyed, and perishes\nwith them. But essences being taken for ideas established in the mind,\nwith names annexed to them, they are supposed to remain steadily the\nsame, whatever mutations the particular substances are liable to. For,\nwhatever becomes of ALEXANDER and BUCEPHALUS, the ideas to which MAN and\nHORSE are annexed, are supposed nevertheless to remain the same; and\nso the essences of those species are preserved whole and undestroyed,\nwhatever changes happen to any or all of the individuals of those\nspecies. By this means the essence of a species rests safe and entire,\nwithout the existence of so much as one individual of that kind. For,\nwere there now no circle existing anywhere in the world, (as perhaps\nthat figure exists not anywhere exactly marked out,) yet the idea\nannexed to that name would not cease to be what it is; nor cease to be\nas a pattern to determine which of the particular figures we meet with\nhave or have not a right to the NAME circle, and so to show which of\nthem, by having that essence, was of that species. And though there\nneither were nor had been in nature such a beast as an UNICORN, or such\na fish as a MERMAID; yet, supposing those names to stand for complex\nabstract ideas that contained no inconsistency in them, the essence of a\nmermaid is as intelligible as that of a man; and the idea of an unicorn\nas certain, steady, and permanent as that of a horse. From what has been\nsaid, it is evident, that the doctrine of the immutability of essences\nproves them to be only abstract ideas; and is founded on the relation\nestablished between them and certain sounds as signs of them; and\nwill always be true, as long as the same name can have the same\nsignification.\n20. Recapitulation.\nTo conclude. This is that which in short I would say, viz. that all the\ngreat business of GENERA and SPECIES, and their ESSENCES, amounts to no\nmore but this:--That men making abstract ideas, and settling them in\ntheir minds with names annexed to them, do thereby enable themselves to\nconsider things, and discourse of them, as it were in bundles, for the\neasier and readier improvement and communication of their knowledge,\nwhich would advance but slowly were their words and thoughts confined\nonly to particulars.\nCHAPTER IV.\nOF THE NAMES OF SIMPLE IDEAS.\n1. Names of simple Ideas, Modes, and Substances, have each something\npeculiar.\nThough all words, as I have shown, signify nothing immediately but the\nideas in the mind of the speaker; yet, upon a nearer survey, we shall\nfind the names of SIMPLE IDEAS, MIXED MODES (under which I comprise\nRELATIONS too), and NATURAL SUBSTANCES, have each of them something\npeculiar and different from the other. For example:--\n2. First, Names of simple Ideas, and of Substances intimate real\nExistence.\nFirst, the names of SIMPLE IDEAS and SUBSTANCES, with the abstract ideas\nin the mind which they immediately signify, intimate also some real\nexistence, from which was derived their original pattern. But the names\nof MIXED MODES terminate in the idea that is in the mind, and lead not\nthe thoughts any further; as we shall see more at large in the following\nchapter.\n3. Secondly, Names of simple Ideas and Modes signify always both real\nand nominal Essences.\nSecondly, The names of simple ideas and modes signify always the real\nas well as nominal essence of their species. But the names of natural\nsubstances signify rarely, if ever, anything but barely the nominal\nessences of those species; as we shall show in the chapter that treats\nof the names of substances in particular.\n4. Thirdly, Names of simple Ideas are undefinable.\nThirdly, The names of simple ideas are not capable of any definition;\nthe names of all complex ideas are. It has not, that I know, been yet\nobserved by anybody what words are, and what are not, capable of being\ndefined; the want whereof is (as I am apt to think) not seldom the\noccasion of great wrangling and obscurity in men's discourses, whilst\nsome demand definitions of terms that cannot be defined; and others\nthink they ought not to rest satisfied in an explication made by a more\ngeneral word, and its restriction, (or to speak in terms of art, by a\ngenus and difference,) when, even after such definition, made according\nto rule, those who hear it have often no more a clear conception of the\nmeaning of the word than they had before. This at least I think, that\nthe showing what words are, and what are not, capable of definitions,\nand wherein consists a good definition, is not wholly besides our\npresent purpose; and perhaps will afford so much light to the nature\nof these signs and our ideas, as to deserve a more particular\nconsideration.\n5. If all names were definable, it would be a Process IN INFINITUM.\nI will not here trouble myself to prove that all terms are not\ndefinable, from that progress IN INFINITUM, which it will visibly lead\nus into, if we should allow that all names could be defined. For, if the\nterms of one definition were still to be defined by another, where at\nlast should we stop? But I shall, from the nature of our ideas, and the\nsignification of our words, show WHY SOME NAMES CAN, AND OTHERS CANNOT\nBE DEFINED; and WHICH THEY ARE.\n6. What a Definition is.\nI think it is agreed, that a DEFINITION is nothing else but THE SHOWING\nTHE MEANING OF ONE WORD BY SEVERAL OTHER NOT SYNONYMOUS TERMS. The\nmeaning of words being only the ideas they are made to stand for by him\nthat uses them, the meaning of any term is then showed, or the word is\ndefined, when, by other words, the idea it is made the sign of, and\nannexed to, in the mind of the speaker, is as it were represented, or\nset before the view of another; and thus its signification ascertained.\nThis is the only use and end of definitions; and therefore the only\nmeasure of what is, or is not a good definition.\n7. Simple Ideas, why undefinable.\nThis being premised, I say that the NAMES OF SIMPLE IDEAS, AND THOSE\nONLY, ARE INCAPABLE OF BEING DEFINED. The reason whereof is this, That\nthe several terms of a definition, signifying several ideas, they can\nall together by no means represent an idea which has no composition\nat all: and therefore a definition, which is properly nothing but the\nshowing the meaning of one word by several others not signifying each\nthe same thing, can in the names of simple ideas have no place.\n8. Instances: Scholastic definitions of Motion.\nThe not observing this difference in our ideas, and their names, has\nproduced that eminent trifling in the schools, which is so easy to be\nobserved in the definitions they give us of some few of these simple\nideas. For, as to the greatest part of them, even those masters\nof definitions were fain to leave them untouched, merely by the\nimpossibility they found in it. What more exquisite jargon could the wit\nof man invent, than this definition:--'The act of a being in power, as\nfar forth as in power;' which would puzzle any rational man, to whom it\nwas not already known by its famous absurdity, to guess what word it\ncould ever be supposed to be the explication of. If Tully, asking a\nDutchman what BEWEEGINGE was, should have received this explication\nin his own language, that it was 'actus entis in potentia quatenus in\npotentia;' I ask whether any one can imagine he could thereby have\nunderstood what the word BEWEEGINGE signified, or have guessed what idea\na Dutchman ordinarily had in his mind, and would signify to another,\nwhen he used that sound?\n9. Modern definition of Motion.\nNor have the modern philosophers, who have endeavoured to throw off the\njargon of the schools, and speak intelligibly, much better succeeded\nin defining simple ideas, whether by explaining their causes, or any\notherwise. The atomists, who define motion to be 'a passage from one\nplace to another,' what do they more than put one synonymous word for\nanother? For what is PASSAGE other than MOTION? And if they were asked\nwhat passage was, how would they better define it than by motion? For is\nit not at least as proper and significant to say, Passage is a motion\nfrom one place to another, as to say, Motion is a passage, &c.? This is\nto translate, and not to define, when we change two words of the same\nsignification one for another; which, when one is better understood than\nthe other, may serve to discover what idea the unknown stands for; but\nis very far from a definition, unless we will say every English word in\nthe dictionary is the definition of the Latin word it answers, and that\nmotion is a definition of MOTUS. Nor will 'the successive application of\nthe parts of the superficies of one body to those of another,' which the\nCartesians give us, prove a much better definition of motion, when well\nexamined.\n10. Definitions of Light.\n'The act of perspicuous, as far forth as perspicuous,' is another\nPeripatetic definition of a simple idea; which, though not more\nabsurd than the former of motion, yet betrays its uselessness and\ninsignificancy more plainly; because experience will easily convince any\none that it cannot make the meaning of the word LIGHT (which it pretends\nto define) at all understood by a blind man, but the definition of\nmotion appears not at first sight so useless, because it escapes this\nway of trial. For this simple idea, entering by the touch as well as\nsight, it is impossible to show an example of any one who has no other\nway to get the idea of motion, but barely by the definition of that\nname. Those who tell us that light is a great number of little globules,\nstriking briskly on the bottom of the eye, speak more intelligibly than\nthe Schools: but yet these words never so well understood would make the\nidea the word light stands for no more known to a man that understands\nit not before, than if one should tell him that light was nothing but a\ncompany of little tennis-balls, which fairies all day long struck with\nrackets against some men's foreheads, whilst they passed by others. For\ngranting this explication of the thing to be true, yet the idea of the\ncause of light, if we had it never so exact, would no more give us the\nidea of light itself, as it is such a particular perception in us, than\nthe idea of the figure and motion of a sharp piece of steel would give\nus the idea of that pain which it is able to cause in us. For the cause\nof any sensation, and the sensation itself, in all the simple ideas of\none sense, are two ideas; and two ideas so different and distant one\nfrom another, that no two can be more so. And therefore, should Des\nCartes's globules strike never so long on the retina of a man who was\nblind by a gutta serena, he would thereby never have any idea of light,\nor anything approaching it, though he understood never so well what\nlittle globules were, and what striking on another body was. And\ntherefore the Cartesians very well distinguish between that light which\nis the cause of that sensation in us, and the idea which is produced in\nus by it, and is that which is properly light.\n11. Simple Ideas, why undefinable, further explained.\nSimple ideas, as has been shown, are only to be got by those impressions\nobjects themselves make on our minds, by the proper inlets appointed\nto each sort. If they are not received this way, all the words in the\nworld, made use of to explain or define any of their names, will never\nbe able to produce in us the idea it stands for. For, words being\nsounds, can produce in us no other simple ideas than of those very\nsounds; nor excite any in us, but by that voluntary connexion which is\nknown to be between them and those simple ideas which common use has\nmade them the signs of. He that thinks otherwise, let him try if any\nwords can give him the taste of a pine apple, and make him have the true\nidea of the relish of that celebrated delicious fruit. So far as he\nis told it has a resemblance with any tastes whereof he has the ideas\nalready in his memory, imprinted there by sensible objects, not\nstrangers to his palate, so far may he approach that resemblance in his\nmind. But this is not giving us that idea by a definition, but exciting\nin us other simple ideas by their known names; which will be still\nvery different from the true taste of that fruit itself. In light and\ncolours, and all other simple ideas, it is the same thing: for the\nsignification of sounds is not natural, but only imposed and arbitrary.\nAnd no DEFINITION of light or redness is more fitted or able to produce\neither of those ideas in us, than the SOUND light or red, by itself.\nFor, to hope to produce an idea of light or colour by a sound, however\nformed, is to expect that sounds should be visible, or colours audible;\nand to make the ears do the office of all the other senses. Which is all\none as to say, that we might taste, smell, and see by the ears: a sort\nof philosophy worthy only of Sancho Panza, who had the faculty to see\nDulcinea by hearsay. And therefore he that has not before received into\nhis mind, by the proper inlet, the simple idea which any word stands\nfor, can never come to know the signification of that word by any other\nwords or sounds whatsoever, put together according to any rules of\ndefinition. The only way is, by applying to his senses the proper\nobject; and so producing that idea in him, for which he has learned the\nname already. A studious blind man, who had mightily beat his head\nabout visible objects, and made use of the explication of his books and\nfriends, to understand those names of light and colours which often\ncame in his way, bragged one day, That he now understood what SCARLET\nsignified. Upon which, his friend demanding what scarlet was? The\nblind man answered, It was like the sound of a trumpet. Just such an\nunderstanding of the name of any other simple idea will he have, who\nhopes to get it only from a definition, or other words made use of to\nexplain it.\n12. The contrary shown in complex ideas, by instances of a Statue and\nRainbow.\nThe case is quite otherwise in COMPLEX IDEAS; which, consisting of\nseveral simple ones, it is in the power of words, standing for the\nseveral ideas that make that composition, to imprint complex ideas in\nthe mind which were never there before, and so make their names be\nunderstood. In such collections of ideas, passing under one name,\ndefinition, or the teaching the signification of one word by several\nothers, has place, and may make us understand the names of things which\nnever came within the reach of our senses; and frame ideas suitable to\nthose in other men's minds, when they use those names: provided that\nnone of the terms of the definition stand for any such simple ideas,\nwhich he to whom the explication is made has never yet had in his\nthought. Thus the word STATUE may be explained to a blind man by other\nwords, when PICTURE cannot; his senses having given him the idea of\nfigure, but not of colours, which therefore words cannot excite in him.\nThis gained the prize to the painter against the statuary: each of which\ncontending for the excellency of his art, and the statuary bragging that\nhis was to be preferred, because it reached further, and even those who\nhad lost their eyes could yet perceive the excellency of it. The painter\nagreed to refer himself to the judgment of a blind man; who being\nbrought where there was a statue made by the one, and a picture drawn by\nthe other; he was first led to the statue, in which he traced with his\nhands all the lineaments of the face and body, and with great admiration\napplauded the skill of the workman. But being led to the picture, and\nhaving his hands laid upon it, was told, that now he touched the head,\nand then the forehead, eyes, nose, &c., as his hand moved over the\nparts of the picture on the cloth, without finding any the least\ndistinction: whereupon he cried out, that certainly that must needs be a\nvery admirable and divine piece of workmanship, which could represent to\nthem all those parts, where he could neither feel nor perceive anything.\n13. Colours indefinable to the born-blind.\nHe that should use the word RAINBOW to one who knew all those colours,\nbut yet had never seen that phenomenon, would, by enumerating the\nfigure, largeness, position, and order of the colours, so well\ndefine that word that it might be perfectly understood. But yet that\ndefinition, how exact and perfect soever, would never make a blind\nman understand it; because several of the simple ideas that make\nthat complex one, being such as he never received by sensation and\nexperience, no words are able to excite them in his mind.\n14. Complex Ideas definable only when the simple ideas of which they\nconsist have been got from experience.\nSimple ideas, as has been shown, can only be got by experience from\nthose objects which are proper to produce in us those perceptions. When,\nby this means, we have our minds stored with them, and know the names\nfor them, then we are in a condition to define, and by definition to\nunderstand, the names of complex ideas that are made up of them. But\nwhen any term stands for a simple idea that a man has never yet had in\nhis mind, it is impossible by any words to make known its meaning to\nhim. When any term stands for an idea a man is acquainted with, but is\nignorant that that term is the sign of it, then another name of the\nsame idea, which he has been accustomed to, may make him understand\nits meaning. But in no case whatsoever is any name of any simple idea\ncapable of a definition.\n15. Fourthly, Names of simple Ideas of less doubtful meaning than those\nof mixed modes and substances.\nFourthly, But though the names of simple ideas have not the help of\ndefinition to determine their signification, yet that hinders not but\nthat they are generally less doubtful and uncertain than those of\nmixed modes and substances; because they, standing only for one simple\nperception, men for the most part easily and perfectly agree in their\nsignification; and there is little room for mistake and wrangling about\ntheir meaning. He that knows once that whiteness is the name of that\ncolour he has observed in snow or milk, will not be apt to misapply that\nword, as long as he retains that idea; which when he has quite lost, he\nis not apt to mistake the meaning of it, but perceives he understands it\nnot. There is neither a multiplicity of simple ideas to be put together,\nwhich makes the doubtfulness in the names of mixed modes; nor a\nsupposed, but an unknown, real essence, with properties depending\nthereon, the precise number whereof is also unknown, which makes the\ndifficulty in the names of substances. But, on the contrary, in simple\nideas the whole signification of the name is known at once, and consists\nnot of parts, whereof more or less being put in, the idea may be varied,\nand so the signification of name be obscure, or uncertain.\n16. Simple Ideas have few Ascents in linea praedicamentali.\nFifthly, This further may be observed concerning simple Simple ideas and\ntheir names, that they have but few ascents in linea praedicamentali,\n(as they call it,) from the lowest species to the summum genus. The\nreason whereof is, that the lowest species being but one simple idea,\nnothing can be left out of it, that so the difference being taken away,\nit may agree with some other thing in one idea common to them both;\nwhich, having one name, is the genus of the other two: v.g. there is\nnothing that can be left out of the idea of white and red to make\nthem agree in one common appearance, and so have one general name; as\nRATIONALITY being left out of the complex idea of man, makes it agree\nwith brute in the more general idea and name of animal. And therefore\nwhen, to avoid unpleasant enumerations, men would comprehend both white\nand red, and several other such simple ideas, under one general name,\nthey have been fain to do it by a word which denotes only the way they\nget into the mind. For when white, red, and yellow are all comprehended\nunder the genus or name colour, it signifies no more but such ideas\nas are produced in the mind only by the sight, and have entrance only\nthrough the eyes. And when they would frame yet a more general term to\ncomprehend both colours and sounds, and the like simple ideas, they do\nit by a word that signifies all such as come into the mind only by one\nsense. And so the general term QUALITY, in its ordinary acceptation,\ncomprehends colours, sounds, tastes, smells, and tangible qualities,\nwith distinction from extension, number, motion, pleasure, and pain,\nwhich make impressions on the mind and introduce their ideas by more\nsenses than one.\n17. Sixthly, Names of simple Ideas not arbitrary, but perfectly taken\nfrom the existence of things.\nSixthly, The names of simple ideas, substances, and mixed modes have\nalso this difference: that those of MIXED MODES stand for ideas\nperfectly arbitrary; those of SUBSTANCES are not perfectly so, but refer\nto a pattern, though with some latitude; and those of SIMPLE IDEAS are\nperfectly taken from the existence of things, and are not arbitrary at\nall. Which, what difference it makes in the significations of their\nnames, we shall see in the following chapters.\nSimple modes.\nThe names of SIMPLE MODES differ little from those of simple ideas.\nCHAPTER V.\nOF THE NAMES OF MIXED MODES AND RELATIONS.\n1. Mixed modes stand for abstract Ideas, as other general Names.\nThe names of MIXED MODES, being general, they stand, as has been shewed,\nfor sorts or species of things, each of which has its peculiar essence.\nThe essences of these species also, as has been shewed, are nothing but\nthe abstract ideas in the mind, to which the name is annexed. Thus far\nthe names and essences of mixed modes have nothing but what is common to\nthem with other ideas: but if we take a little nearer survey of them, we\nshall find that they have something peculiar, which perhaps may deserve\nour attention.\n2. First, The abstract Ideas they stand for are made by the\nUnderstanding.\nThe first particularity I shall observe in them, is, that the abstract\nideas, or, if you please, the essences, of the several species of mixed\nmodes, are MADE BY THE UNDERSTANDING, wherein they differ from those of\nsimple ideas: in which sort the mind has no power to make any one, but\nonly receives such as are presented to it by the real existence of\nthings operating upon it.\n3. Secondly, Made arbitrarily, and without Patterns.\nIn the next place, these essences of the species of mixed modes are not\nonly made by the mind, but MADE VERY ARBITRARILY, MADE WITHOUT PATTERNS,\nOR REFERENCE TO ANY REAL EXISTENCE. Wherein they differ from those of\nsubstances, which carry with them the supposition of some real being,\nfrom which they are taken, and to which they are conformable. But, in\nits complex ideas of mixed modes, the mind takes a liberty not to\nfollow the existence of things exactly. It unites and retains certain\ncollections, as so many distinct specific ideas; whilst others, that as\noften occur in nature, and are as plainly suggested by outward things,\npass neglected, without particular names or specifications. Nor does the\nmind, in these of mixed modes, as in the complex idea of substances,\nexamine them by the real existence of things; or verify them by patterns\ncontaining such peculiar compositions in nature. To know whether his\nidea of ADULTERY or INCEST be right, will a man seek it anywhere amongst\nthings existing? Or is it true because any one has been witness to such\nan action? No: but it suffices here, that men have put together such a\ncollection into one complex idea, that makes the archetype and specific\nidea; whether ever any such action were committed in rerum natura or no.\n4. How this is done.\nTo understand this right, we must consider wherein this making of these\ncomplex ideas consists; and that is not in the making any new idea, but\nputting together those which the mind had before. Wherein the mind does\nthese three things: First, It chooses a certain number; Secondly, It\ngives them connexion, and makes them into one idea; Thirdly, It ties\nthem together by a name. If we examine how the mind proceeds in these,\nand what liberty it takes in them, we shall easily observe how these\nessences of the species of mixed modes are the workmanship of the mind;\nand, consequently, that the species themselves are of men's making.\n5. Evidently arbitrary, in that the Idea is often before the Existence.\nNobody can doubt but that these ideas of mixed modes are made by a\nvoluntary collection of ideas, put together in the mind, independent\nfrom any original patterns in nature, who will but reflect that this\nsort of complex ideas may be made, abstracted, and have names given\nthem, and so a species be constituted, before any one individual of\nthat species ever existed. Who can doubt but the ideas of SACRILEGE or\nADULTERY might be framed in the minds of men, and have names given them,\nand so these species of mixed modes be constituted, before either of\nthem was ever committed; and might be as well discoursed of and reasoned\nabout, and as certain truths discovered of them, whilst yet they had no\nbeing but in the understanding, as well as now, that they have but too\nfrequently a real existence? Whereby it is plain how much the sorts of\nmixed modes are the creatures of the understanding, where they have a\nbeing as subservient to all the ends of real truth and knowledge, as\nwhen they really exist. And we cannot doubt but law-makers have often\nmade laws about species of actions which were only the creatures of\ntheir own understandings; beings that had no other existence but in\ntheir own minds. And I think nobody can deny but that the RESURRECTION\nwas a species of mixed modes in the mind, before it really existed.\n6. Instances: Murder, Incest, Stabbing.\nTo see how arbitrarily these essences of mixed modes are made by the\nmind, we need but take a view of almost any of them. A little looking\ninto them will satisfy us, that it is the mind that combines several\nscattered independent ideas into one complex one; and, by the common\nname it gives them, makes them the essence of a certain species, without\nregulating itself by any connexion they have in nature. For what greater\nconnexion in nature has the idea of a man than the idea of a sheep with\nkilling, that this is made a particular species of action, signified by\nthe word MURDER, and the other not? Or what union is there in nature\nbetween the idea of the relation of a father with killing than that of\na son or neighbour, that those are combined into one complex idea, and\nthereby made the essence of the distinct species PARRICIDE, whilst the\nother makes no distinct species at all? But, though they have made\nkilling a man's father or mother a distinct species from killing his son\nor daughter, yet, in some other cases, son and daughter are taken in\ntoo, as well as father and mother: and they are all equally comprehended\nin the same species, as in that of INCEST. Thus the mind in mixed modes\narbitrarily unites into complex ideas such as it finds convenient;\nwhilst others that have altogether as much union in nature are left\nloose, and never combined into one idea, because they have no need of\none name. It is evident then that the mind, by its free choice, gives\na connexion to a certain number of ideas, which in nature have no more\nunion with one another than others that it leaves out: why else is the\npart of the weapon the beginning of the wound is made with taken notice\nof, to make the distinct species called STABBING, and the figure and\nmatter of the weapon left out? I do not say this is done without reason,\nas we shall see more by and by; but this I say, that it is done by the\nfree choice of the mind, pursuing its own ends; and that, therefore,\nthese species of mixed modes are the workmanship of the understanding.\nAnd there is nothing more evident than that, for the most part, in the\nframing these ideas, the mind searches not its patterns in nature, nor\nrefers the ideas it makes to the real existence of things, but puts such\ntogether as may best serve its own purposes, without tying itself to a\nprecise imitation of anything that really exists.\n7. But still subservient to the End of Language, and not made at random.\nBut, though these complex ideas or essences of mixed modes depend on the\nmind, and are made by it with great liberty, yet they are not made at\nrandom, and jumbled together without any reason at all. Though these\ncomplex ideas be not always copied from nature, yet they are always\nsuited to the end for which abstract ideas are made: and though they be\ncombinations made of ideas that are loose enough, and have as little\nunion in themselves as several other to which the mind never gives a\nconnexion that combines them into one idea; yet they are always made for\nthe convenience of communication, which is the chief end of language.\nThe use of language is, by short sounds, to signify with ease and\ndispatch general conceptions; wherein not only abundance of particulars\nmay be contained, but also a great variety of independent ideas\ncollected into one complex one. In the making therefore of the species\nof mixed modes, men have had regard only to such combinations as they\nhad occasion to mention one to another. Those they have combined into\ndistinct complex ideas, and given names to; whilst others, that in\nnature have as near a union, are left loose and unregarded. For, to go\nno further than human actions themselves, if they would make distinct\nabstract ideas of all the varieties which might be observed in them, the\nnumber must be infinite, and the memory confounded with the plenty, as\nwell as overcharged to little purpose. It suffices that men make and\nname so many complex ideas of these mixed modes as they find they have\noccasion to have names for, in the ordinary occurrence of their affairs.\nIf they join to the idea of killing the idea of father or mother, and\nso make a distinct species from killing a man's son or neighbour, it\nis because of the different heinousness of the crime, and the distinct\npunishment is due to the murdering a man's father and mother, different\nto what ought to be inflicted on the murder of a son or neighbour; and\ntherefore they find it necessary to mention it by a distinct name, which\nis the end of making that distinct combination. But though the ideas of\nmother and daughter are so differently treated, in reference to the idea\nof killing, that the one is joined with it to make a distinct abstract\nidea with a name, and so a distinct species, and the other not; yet, in\nrespect of carnal knowledge, they are both taken in under INCEST: and\nthat still for the same convenience of expressing under one name, and\nreckoning of one species, such unclean mixtures as have a peculiar\nturpitude beyond others; and this to avoid circumlocutions and tedious\ndescriptions.\n8. Whereof the intranslatable Words of divers Languages are a Proof.\nA moderate skill in different languages will easily satisfy one of the\ntruth of this, it being so obvious to observe great store of words in\none language which have not any that answer them in another. Which\nplainly shows that those of one country, by their customs and manner of\nlife, have found occasion to make several complex ideas, and given names\nto them, which others never collected into specific ideas. This could\nnot have happened if these species were the steady workmanship of\nnature, and not collections made and abstracted by the mind, in order to\nnaming, and for the convenience of communication. The terms of our law,\nwhich are not empty sounds, will hardly find words that answer them in\nthe Spanish or Italian, no scanty languages; much less, I think, could\nany one translate them into the Caribbee or Westoe tongues: and the\nVERSURA of the Romans, or CORBAN of the Jews, have no words in other\nlanguages to answer them; the reason whereof is plain, from what has\nbeen said. Nay, if we look a little more nearly into this matter, and\nexactly compare different languages, we shall find that, though they\nhave words which in translations and dictionaries are supposed to answer\none another, yet there is scarce one often amongst the names of complex\nideas, especially of mixed modes, that stands for the same precise idea\nwhich the word does that in dictionaries it is rendered by. There are\nno ideas more common and less compounded than the measures of time,\nextension, and weight; and the Latin names, HORA, PES, LIBRA, are\nwithout difficulty rendered by the English names, HOUR, FOOT, and POUND:\nbut yet there is nothing more evident than that the ideas a Roman\nannexed to these Latin names, were very far different from those which\nan Englishman expresses by those English ones. And if either of these\nshould make use of the measures that those of the other language\ndesigned by their names, he would be quite out in his account. These are\ntoo sensible proofs to be doubted; and we shall find this much more so\nin the names of more abstract and compounded ideas, such as are the\ngreatest part of those which make up moral discourses: whose names, when\nmen come curiously to compare with those they are translated into, in\nother languages, they will find very few of them exactly to correspond\nin the whole extent of their significations.\n9. This shows Species to be made for Communication.\nThe reason why I take so particular notice of this is, that we may not\nbe mistaken about GENERA and SPECIES, and their ESSENCES, as if they\nwere things regularly and constantly made by nature, and had a real\nexistence in things; when they appear, upon a more wary survey, to\nbe nothing else but an artifice of the understanding, for the easier\nsignifying such collections of ideas as it should often have occasion to\ncommunicate by one general term; under which divers particulars, as far\nforth as they agreed to that abstract idea, might be comprehended. And\nif the doubtful signification of the word SPECIES may make it sound\nharsh to some, that I say the species of mixed modes are 'made by the\nunderstanding'; yet, I think, it can by nobody be denied that it is the\nmind makes those abstract complex ideas to which specific names are\ngiven. And if it be true, as it is, that the mind makes the patterns for\nsorting and naming of things, I leave it to be considered who makes the\nboundaries of the sort or species; since with me SPECIES and SORT have\nno other difference than that of a Latin and English idiom.\n10. In mixed Modes it is the Name that ties the Combination of simple\nideas together, and makes it a Species.\nThe near relation that there is between SPECIES, ESSENCES, and their\nGENERAL NAME, at least in mixed modes, will further appear when we\nconsider, that it is the name that seems to preserve those essences, and\ngive them their lasting duration. For, the connexion between the loose\nparts of those complex ideas being made by the mind, this union, which\nhas no particular foundation in nature, would cease again, were there\nnot something that did, as it were, hold it together, and keep the parts\nfrom scattering. Though therefore it be the mind that makes the\ncollection, it is the name which is as it were the knot that ties them\nfast together. What a vast variety of different ideas does the word\nTRIUMPHUS hold together, and deliver to us as one species! Had this name\nbeen never made, or quite lost, we might, no doubt, have had\ndescriptions of what passed in that solemnity: but yet, I think, that\nwhich holds those different parts together, in the unity of one complex\nidea, is that very word annexed to it; without which the several parts\nof that would no more be thought to make one thing, than any other show,\nwhich having never been made but once, had never been united into one\ncomplex idea, under one denomination. How much, therefore, in mixed\nmodes, the unity necessary to any essence depends on the mind; and how\nmuch the continuation and fixing of that unity depends on the name in\ncommon use annexed to it, I leave to be considered by those who look\nupon essences and species as real established things in nature.\n11.\nSuitable to this, we find that men speaking of mixed modes, seldom\nimagine or take any other for species of them, but such as are set out\nby name: because they, being of man's making only, in order to naming,\nno such species are taken notice of, or supposed to be, unless a name be\njoined to it, as the sign of man's having combined into one idea several\nloose ones; and by that name giving a lasting union to the parts which\nwould otherwise cease to have any, as soon as the mind laid by that\nabstract idea, and ceased actually to think on it. But when a name\nis once annexed to it, wherein the parts of that complex idea have\na settled and permanent union, then is the essence, as it were,\nestablished, and the species looked on as complete. For to what purpose\nshould the memory charge itself with such compositions, unless it were\nby abstraction to make them general? And to what purpose make them\ngeneral, unless it were that they might have general names for the\nconvenience of discourse and communication? Thus we see, that killing a\nman with a sword or a hatchet are looked on as no distinct species of\naction; but if the point of the sword first enter the body, it passes\nfor a distinct species, where it has a distinct name, as in England, in\nwhose language it is called STABBING: but in another country, where it\nhas not happened to be specified under a peculiar name, it passes not\nfor a distinct species. But in the species of corporeal substances,\nthough it be the mind that makes the nominal essence, yet, since those\nideas which are combined in it are supposed to have an union in nature\nwhether the mind joins them or not, therefore those are looked on as\ndistinct species, without any operation of the mind, either abstracting,\nor giving a name to that complex idea.\n12. For the Originals of our mixed Modes, we look no further than the\nMind; which also shows them to be the Workmanship of the Understanding.\nConformable also to what has been said concerning the essences of the\nspecies of mixed modes, that they are the creatures of the understanding\nrather than the works of nature; conformable, I say, to this, we find\nthat their names lead our thoughts to the mind, and no further. When we\nspeak of JUSTICE, or GRATITUDE, we frame to ourselves no imagination of\nanything existing, which we would conceive; but our thoughts terminate\nin the abstract ideas of those virtues, and look not further; as they do\nwhen we speak of a HORSE, or IRON, whose specific ideas we consider not\nas barely in the mind, but as in things themselves, which afford the\noriginal patterns of those ideas. But in mixed modes, at least the most\nconsiderable parts of them, which are moral beings, we consider the\noriginal patterns as being in the mind, and to those we refer for the\ndistinguishing of particular beings under names. And hence I think it\nis that these essences of the species of mixed modes are by a more\nparticular name called NOTIONS; as, by a peculiar right, appertaining to\nthe understanding.\n13. Their being made by the Understanding without Patterns, shows the\nReason why they are so compounded.\nHence, likewise, we may learn why the complex ideas of mixed modes\nare commonly more compounded and decompounded than those of natural\nsubstances. Because they being the workmanship of the understanding,\npursuing only its own ends, and the conveniency of expressing in short\nthose ideas it would make known to another, it does with great liberty\nunite often into one abstract idea things that, in their nature, have\nno coherence; and so under one term bundle together a great variety of\ncompounded and decompounded ideas. Thus the name of PROCESSION: what a\ngreat mixture of independent ideas of persons, habits, tapers, orders,\nmotions, sounds, does it contain in that complex one, which the mind of\nman has arbitrarily put together, to express by that one name? Whereas\nthe complex ideas of the sorts of substances are usually made up of only\na small number of simple ones; and in the species of animals, these two,\nviz. shape and voice, commonly make the whole nominal essence.\n14. Names of mixed Modes stand alway for their real Essences, which are\nthe workmanship of our minds.\nAnother thing we may observe from what has been said is, That the\nnames of mixed modes always signify (when they have any determined\nsignification) the REAL essences of their species. For, these abstract\nideas being the workmanship of the mind, and not referred to the real\nexistence of things, there is no supposition of anything more signified\nby that name, but barely that complex idea the mind itself has formed;\nwhich is all it would have expressed by it; and is that on which all the\nproperties of the species depend, and from which alone they all flow:\nand so in these the real and nominal essence is the same; which, of what\nconcernment it is to the certain knowledge of general truth, we shall\nsee hereafter.\n15. Why their Names are usually got before their Ideas.\nThis also may show us the reason why for the most part the names of\nmixed modes are got before the ideas they stand for are perfectly known.\nBecause there being no species of these ordinarily taken notice of but\nwhat have names, and those species, or rather their essences, being\nabstract complex ideas, made arbitrarily by the mind, it is convenient,\nif not necessary, to know the names, before one endeavour to frame\nthese complex ideas: unless a man will fill his head with a company\nof abstract complex ideas, which, others having no names for, he has\nnothing to do with, but to lay by and forget again. I confess that, in\nthe beginning of languages, it was necessary to have the idea before one\ngave it the name: and so it is still, where, making a new complex idea,\none also, by giving it a new name, makes a new word. But this concerns\nnot languages made, which have generally pretty well provided for ideas\nwhich men have frequent occasion to have and communicate; and in such, I\nask whether it be not the ordinary method, that children learn the names\nof mixed modes before they have their ideas? What one of a thousand ever\nframes the abstract ideas of GLORY and AMBITION, before he has heard the\nnames of them? In simple ideas and substances I grant it is otherwise;\nwhich, being such ideas as have a real existence and union in nature,\nthe ideas and names are got one before the other, as it happens.\n16. Reason of my being so large on this Subject.\nWhat has been said here of MIXED MODES is, with very little difference,\napplicable also to RELATIONS; which, since every man himself may\nobserve, I may spare myself the pains to enlarge on: especially, since\nwhat I have here said concerning Words in this third Book, will possibly\nbe thought by some to this be much more than what so slight a subject\nrequired. I allow it might be brought into a narrower compass; but I was\nwilling to stay my reader on an argument that appears to me new and a\nlittle out of the way, (I am sure it is one I thought not of when I\nbegan to write,) that, by searching it to the bottom, and turning it on\nevery side, some part or other might meet with every one's thoughts, and\ngive occasion to the most averse or negligent to reflect on a general\nmiscarriage, which, though of great consequence, is little taken notice\nof. When it is considered what a pudder is made about ESSENCES, and how\nmuch all sorts of knowledge, discourse, and conversation are pestered\nand disordered by the careless and confused use and application of\nwords, it will perhaps be thought worth while thoroughly to lay it open.\nAnd I shall be pardoned if I have dwelt long on an argument which I\nthink, therefore, needs to be inculcated, because the faults men are\nusually guilty of in this kind, are not only the greatest hindrances of\ntrue knowledge, but are so well thought of as to pass for it. Men would\noften see what a small pittance of reason and truth, or possibly none at\nall, is mixed with those huffing opinions they are swelled with; if they\nwould but look beyond fashionable sounds, and observe what IDEAS are or\nare not comprehended under those words with which they are so armed at\nall points, and with which they so confidently lay about them. I shall\nimagine I have done some service to truth, peace, and learning, if, by\nany enlargement on this subject, I can make men reflect on their own use\nof language; and give them reason to suspect, that, since it is frequent\nfor others, it may also be possible for them, to have sometimes very\ngood and approved words in their mouths and writings, with very\nuncertain, little, or no signification. And therefore it is not\nunreasonable for them to be wary herein themselves, and not to be\nunwilling to have them examined by others. With this design, therefore,\nI shall go on with what I have further to say concerning this matter.\nCHAPTER VI.\nOF THE NAMES OF SUBSTANCES.\n1. The common Names of Substances stand for Sorts.\nThe common names of substances, as well as other general terms, stand\nfor SORTS: which is nothing else but the being made signs of such\ncomplex ideas wherein several particular substances do or might agree,\nby virtue of which they are capable of being comprehended in one common\nconception, and signified by one name. I say do or might agree: for\nthough there be but one sun existing in the world, yet the idea of it\nbeing abstracted, so that more substances (if there were several) might\neach agree in it, it is as much a sort as if there were as many suns as\nthere are stars. They want not their reasons who think there are, and\nthat each fixed star would answer the idea the name sun stands for, to\none who was placed in a due distance: which, by the way, may show us how\nmuch the sorts, or, if you please, GENERA and SPECIES of things (for\nthose Latin terms signify to me no more than the English word sort)\ndepend on such collections of ideas as men have made, and not on the\nreal nature of things; since it is not impossible but that, in propriety\nof speech, that might be a sun to one which is a star to another.\n2. The Essence of each Sort of substance is our abstract Idea to which\nthe name is annexed.\nThe measure and boundary of each sort or species, whereby it is\nconstituted that particular sort, and distinguished from others, is that\nwe call its ESSENCE, which is nothing but that abstract idea to which\nthe name is annexed; so that everything contained in that idea is\nessential to that sort. This, though it be all the essence of natural\nsubstances that WE know, or by which we distinguish them into sorts, yet\nI call it by a peculiar name, the NOMINAL ESSENCE, to distinguish it\nfrom the real constitution of substances, upon which depends this\nnominal essence, and all the properties of that sort; which, therefore,\nas has been said, may be called the REAL ESSENCE: v.g. the nominal\nessence of gold is that complex idea the word gold stands for, let\nit be, for instance, a body yellow, of a certain weight, malleable,\nfusible, and fixed. But the real essence is the constitution of the\ninsensible parts of that body, on which those qualities and all the\nother properties of gold depend. How far these two are different, though\nthey are both called essence, is obvious at first sight to discover.\n3. The nominal and real Essence different.\nFor, though perhaps voluntary motion, with sense and reason, joined to a\nbody of a certain shape, be the complex idea to which I and others annex\nthe name MAN, and so be the nominal essence of the species so called:\nyet nobody will say that complex idea is the real essence and source of\nall those operations which are to be found in any individual of that\nsort. The foundation of all those qualities which are the ingredients\nof our complex idea, is something quite different: and had we such a\nknowledge of that constitution of man; from which his faculties of\nmoving, sensation, and reasoning, and other powers flow, and on which\nhis so regular shape depends, as it is possible angels have, and it is\ncertain his Maker has, we should have a quite other idea of his essence\nthan what now is contained in our definition of that species, be it what\nit will: and our idea of any individual man would be as far different\nfrom what it is now, as is his who knows all the springs and wheels and\nother contrivances within of the famous clock at Strasburg, from that\nwhich a gazing countryman has of it, who barely sees the motion of the\nhand, and hears the clock strike, and observes only some of the outward\nappearances.\n4. Nothing essential to Individuals.\nThat ESSENCE, in the ordinary use of the word, relates to sorts, and\nthat it is considered in particular beings no further than as they are\nranked into sorts, appears from hence: that, take but away the abstract\nideas by which we sort individuals, and rank them under common names,\nand then the thought of anything essential to any of them instantly\nvanishes: we have no notion of the one without the other, which plainly\nshows their relation. It is necessary for me to be as I am; God and\nnature has made me so: but there is nothing I have is essential to me.\nAn accident or disease may very much alter my colour or shape; a fever\nor fall may take away my reason or memory, or both; and an apoplexy\nleave neither sense, nor understanding, no, nor life. Other creatures of\nmy shape may be made with more and better, or fewer and worse faculties\nthan I have; and others may have reason and sense in a shape and body\nvery different from mine. None of these are essential to the one or the\nother, or to any individual whatever, till the mind refers it to some\nsort or species of things; and then presently, according to the abstract\nidea of that sort, something is found essential. Let any one examine his\nown thoughts, and he will find that as soon as he supposes or speaks\nof essential, the consideration of some species, or the complex idea\nsignified by some general name, comes into his mind; and it is in\nreference to that that this or that quality is said to be essential.\nSo that if it be asked, whether it be essential to me or any other\nparticular corporeal being, to have reason? I say, no; no more than it\nis essential to this white thing I write on to have words in it. But if\nthat particular being be to be counted of the sort MAN, and to have the\nname MAN given it, then reason is essential to it; supposing reason\nto be a part of the complex idea the name man stands for: as it is\nessential to this thing I write on to contain words, if I will give it\nthe name TREATISE, and rank it under that species. So that essential and\nnot essential relate only to our abstract ideas, and the names annexed\nto them; which amounts to no more than this, That whatever particular\nthing has not in it those qualities which are contained in the abstract\nidea which any general term stands for, cannot be ranked under that\nspecies, nor be called by that name; since that abstract idea is the\nvery essence of that species.\n5. The only essences perceived by us in individual substances are those\nqualities which entitle them to receive their names.\nThus, if the idea of BODY with some people be bare extension or space,\nthen solidity is not essential to body: if others make the idea to which\nthey give the name BODY to be solidity and extension, then solidity is\nessential to body. That therefore, and that alone, is considered as\nessential, which makes a part of the complex idea the name of a sort\nstands for; without which no particular thing can be reckoned of that\nsort, nor be entitled to that name. Should there be found a parcel of\nmatter that had all the other qualities that are in iron, but wanted\nobedience to the loadstone, and would neither be drawn by it nor receive\ndirection from it, would any one question whether it wanted anything\nessential? It would be absurd to ask, Whether a thing really existing\nwanted anything essential to it. Or could it be demanded, Whether this\nmade an essential or specific difference or no, since WE have no other\nmeasure of essential or specific but our abstract ideas? And to talk of\nspecific differences in NATURE, without reference to general ideas in\nnames, is to talk unintelligibly. For I would ask any one, What is\nsufficient to make an essential difference in nature between any two\nparticular beings, without any regard had to some abstract idea, which\nis looked upon as the essence and standard of a species? All such\npatterns and standards being quite laid aside, particular beings,\nconsidered barely in themselves, will be found to have all their\nqualities equally essential; and everything in each individual will be\nessential to it; or, which is more, nothing at all. For, though it may\nbe reasonable to ask, Whether obeying the magnet be essential to iron?\nyet I think it is very improper and insignificant to ask, whether it be\nessential to the particular parcel of matter I cut my pen with; without\nconsidering it under the name IRON, or as being of a certain species.\nAnd if, as has been said, our abstract ideas, which have names annexed\nto them, are the boundaries of species, nothing can be essential but\nwhat is contained in those ideas.\n6. Even the real essences of individual substances imply potential\nsorts.\nIt is true, I have often mentioned a REAL ESSENCE, distinct in\nsubstances from those abstract ideas of them, which I call their\nnominal essence. By this real essence I mean, that real constitution\nof anything, which is the foundation of all those properties that are\ncombined in, and are constantly found to co-exist with the nominal\nessence; that particular constitution which everything has within\nitself, without any relation to anything without it. But essence, even\nin this sense, RELATES TO A SORT, AND SUPPOSES A SPECIES. For, being\nthat real constitution on which the properties depend, it necessarily\nsupposes a sort of things, properties belonging only to species, and not\nto individuals: v. g. supposing the nominal essence of gold to be a body\nof such a peculiar colour and weight, with malleability and fusibility,\nthe real essence is that constitution of the parts of matter on which\nthese qualities and their union depend; and is also the foundation of\nits solubility in aqua regia and other properties, accompanying that\ncomplex idea. Here are essences and properties, but all upon supposition\nof a sort or general abstract idea, which is considered as immutable;\nbut there is no individual parcel of matter to which any of these\nqualities are so annexed as to be essential to it or inseparable from\nit. That which is essential belongs to it as a condition whereby it\nis of this or that sort: but take away the consideration of its being\nranked under the name of some abstract idea, and then there is nothing\nnecessary to it, nothing inseparable from it. Indeed, as to the real\nessences of substances, we only suppose their being, without precisely\nknowing what they are; but that which annexes them still to the species\nis the nominal essence, of which they are the supposed foundation and\ncause.\n7. The nominal Essence bounds the Species to us.\nThe next thing to be considered is, by which of those essences it is\nthat substances are determined into sorts or species; and that, it is\nevident, is by the nominal essence. For it is that alone that the name,\nwhich is the mark of the sort, signifies. It is impossible, therefore,\nthat anything should determine the sorts of things, which WE rank under\ngeneral names, but that idea which that name is designed as a mark for;\nwhich is that, as has been shown, which we call nominal essence. Why\ndo we say this is a horse, and that a mule; this is an animal, that an\nherb? How comes any particular thing to be of this or that sort, but\nbecause it has that nominal essence; or, which is all one, agrees to\nthat abstract idea, that name is annexed to? And I desire any one but\nto reflect on his own thoughts, when he hears or speaks any of those or\nother names of substances, to know what sort of essences they stand for.\n8. The nature of Species as formed by us.\nAnd that the species of things to us are nothing but the ranking them\nunder distinct names, according to the complex ideas in US, and not\naccording to precise, distinct, real essences in THEM, is plain from\nhence:--That we find many of the individuals that are ranked into\none sort, called by one common name, and so received as being of one\nspecies, have yet qualities, depending on their real constitutions,\nas far different one from another as from others from which they are\naccounted to differ specifically. This, as it is easy to be observed\nby all who have to do with natural bodies, so chemists especially are\noften, by sad experience, convinced of it, when they, sometimes in vain,\nseek for the same qualities in one parcel of sulphur, antimony, or\nvitriol, which they have found in others. For, though they are bodies of\nthe same species, having the same nominal essence, under the same name,\nyet do they often, upon severe ways of examination, betray qualities so\ndifferent one from another, as to frustrate the expectation and labour\nof very wary chemists. But if things were distinguished into species,\naccording to their real essences, it would be as impossible to find\ndifferent properties in any two individual substances of the same\nspecies, as it is to find different properties in two circles, or\ntwo equilateral triangles. That is properly the essence to US, which\ndetermines every particular to this or that CLASSIS; or, which is the\nsame thing, to this or that general name: and what can that be else, but\nthat abstract idea to which that name is annexed; and so has, in truth,\na reference, not so much to the being of particular things, as to their\ngeneral denominations?\n9. Not the real Essence, or texture of parts, which we know not.\nNor indeed can we rank and sort things, and consequently (which is the\nend of sorting) denominate them, by their real essences; because we know\nthem not. Our faculties carry us no further towards the knowledge and\ndistinction of substances, than a collection of THOSE SENSIBLE IDEAS\nWHICH WE OBSERVE IN THEM; which, however made with the greatest\ndiligence and exactness we are capable of, yet is more remote from the\ntrue internal constitution from which those qualities flow, than, as I\nsaid, a countryman's idea is from the inward contrivance of that famous\nclock at Strasburg, whereof he only sees the outward figure and motions.\nThere is not so contemptible a plant or animal, that does not confound\nthe most enlarged understanding. Though the familiar use of things about\nus take off our wonder, yet it cures not our ignorance. When we come\nto examine the stones we tread on, or the iron we daily handle, we\npresently find we know not their make; and can give no reason of\nthe different qualities we find in them. It is evident the internal\nconstitution, whereon their properties depend, is unknown to us: for to\ngo no further than the grossest and most obvious we can imagine amongst\nthem, What is that texture of parts, that real essence, that makes lead\nand antimony fusible, wood and stones not? What makes lead and iron\nmalleable, antimony and stones not? And yet how infinitely these come\nshort of the fine contrivances and inconceivable real essences of\nplants or animals, every one knows. The workmanship of the all-wise\nand powerful God in the great fabric of the universe, and every part\nthereof, further exceeds the capacity and comprehension of the most\ninquisitive and intelligent man, than the best contrivance of the most\ningenious man doth the conceptions of the most ignorant of rational\ncreatures. Therefore we in vain pretend to range things into sorts, and\ndispose them into certain classes under names, by their real essences,\nthat are so far from our discovery or comprehension. A blind man may as\nsoon sort things by their colours, and he that has lost his smell as\nwell distinguish a lily and a rose by their odours, as by those internal\nconstitutions which he knows not. He that thinks he can distinguish\nsheep and goats by their real essences, that are unknown to him, may\nbe pleased to try his skill in those species called CASSIOWARY and\nQUERECHINCHIO; and by their internal real essences determine the\nboundaries of those species, without knowing the complex idea of\nsensible qualities that each of those names stand for, in the countries\nwhere those animals are to be found.\n10. Not the substantial Form, which know Not.\nThose, therefore, who have been taught that the several species of\nsubstances had their distinct internal SUBSTANTIAL FORMS, and that it\nwas those FORMS which made the distinction of substances into their true\nspecies and genera, were led yet further out of the way by having their\nminds set upon fruitless inquiries after 'substantial forms'; wholly\nunintelligible, and whereof we have scarce so much as any obscure or\nconfused conception in general.\n11. That the Nominal Essence is that only whereby we distinguish Species\nof Substances, further evident, from our ideas of finite Spirits and of\nGod.\nThat our ranking and distinguishing natural substances into species\nconsists in the nominal essences the mind makes, and not in the real\nessences to be found in the things themselves, is further evident from\nour ideas of spirits. For the mind getting, only by reflecting on its\nown operations, those simple ideas which it attributes to spirits, it\nhath or can have no other notion of spirit but by attributing all those\noperations it finds in itself to a sort of beings; without consideration\nof matter. And even the most advanced notion we have of GOD is but\nattributing the same simple ideas which we have got from reflection on\nwhat we find in ourselves, and which we conceive to have more perfection\nin them than would be in their absence; attributing, I say, those simple\nideas to Him in an unlimited degree. Thus, having got from reflecting on\nourselves the idea of existence, knowledge, power and pleasure--each of\nwhich we find it better to have than to want; and the more we have of\neach the better--joining all these together, with infinity to each of\nthem, we have the complex idea of an eternal, omniscient, omnipotent,\ninfinitely wise and happy being. And though we are told that there are\ndifferent species of angels; yet we know not how to frame distinct\nspecific ideas of them: not out of any conceit that the existence of\nmore species than one of spirits is impossible; but because having no\nmore simple ideas (nor being able to frame more) applicable to such\nbeings, but only those few taken from ourselves, and from the actions of\nour own minds in thinking, and being delighted, and moving several parts\nof our bodies; we can no otherwise distinguish in our conceptions the\nseveral species of spirits, one from another, but by attributing those\noperations and powers we find in ourselves to them in a higher or lower\ndegree; and so have no very distinct specific ideas of spirits, except\nonly of GOD, to whom we attribute both duration and all those other\nideas with infinity; to the other spirits, with limitation: nor, as\nI humbly conceive, do we, between GOD and them in our ideas, put any\ndifference, by any number of simple ideas which we have of one and not\nof the other, but only that of infinity. All the particular ideas of\nexistence, knowledge, will, power, and motion, &c., being ideas derived\nfrom the operations of our minds, we attribute all of them to all sorts\nof spirits, with the difference only of degrees; to the utmost we can\nimagine, even infinity, when we would frame as well as we can an idea of\nthe First Being; who yet, it is certain, is infinitely more remote, in\nthe real excellency of his nature, from the highest and perfectest of\nall created beings, than the greatest man, nay, purest seraph, is from\nthe most contemptible part of matter; and consequently must infinitely\nexceed what our narrow understandings can conceive of Him.\n12. Of finite Spirits there are probably numberless Species in a\ncontinuous series of gradations.\nIt is not impossible to conceive, nor repugnant to reason, that there\nmay be many species of spirits, as much separated and diversified one\nfrom another by distinct properties whereof we have no ideas, as the\nspecies of sensible things are distinguished one from another by\nqualities which we know and observe in them. That there should be more\nspecies of intelligent creatures above us, than there are of sensible\nand material below us, is probable to me from hence: that in all the\nvisible corporeal world, we see no chasms or gaps. All quite down from\nus the descent is by easy steps, and a continued series of things, that\nin each remove differ very little one from the other. There are fishes\nthat have wings, and are not strangers to the airy region: and there are\nsome birds that are inhabitants of the water, whose blood is cold as\nfishes, and their flesh so like in taste that the scrupulous are allowed\nthem on fish-days. There are animals so near of kin both to birds and\nbeasts that they are in the middle between both: amphibious animals link\nthe terrestrial and aquatic together; seals live at land and sea, and\nporpoises have the warm blood and entrails of a hog; not to mention what\nis confidently reported of mermaids, or sea-men. There are some brutes\nthat seem to have as much knowledge and reason as some that are called\nmen: and the animal and vegetable kingdoms are so nearly joined, that,\nif you will take the lowest of one and the highest of the other, there\nwill scarce be perceived any great difference between them: and so on,\ntill we come to the lowest and the most inorganical parts of matter, we\nshall find everywhere that the several species are linked together,\nand differ but in almost insensible degrees. And when we consider the\ninfinite power and wisdom of the Maker, we have reason to think that it\nis suitable to the magnificent harmony of the universe, and the great\ndesign and infinite goodness of the Architect, that the species of\ncreatures should also, by gentle degrees, ascend upward from us toward\nhis infinite perfection, as we see they gradually descend from us\ndownwards: which if it be probable, we have reason then to be persuaded\nthat there are far more species of creatures above us than there are\nbeneath; we being, in degrees of perfection, much more remote from the\ninfinite being of God than we are from the lowest state of being, and\nthat which approaches nearest to nothing. And yet of all those distinct\nspecies, for the reasons abovesaid, we have no clear distinct ideas.\n13. The Nominal Essence that of the Species, as conceived by us, proved\nfrom Water and Ice.\nBut to return to the species of corporeal substances. If I should ask\nany one whether ice and water were two distinct species of things, I\ndoubt not but I should be answered in the affirmative: and it cannot be\ndenied but he that says they are two distinct species is in the right.\nBut if an Englishman bred in Jamaica, who perhaps had never seen nor\nheard of ice, coming into England in the winter, find the water he put\nin his basin at night in a great part frozen in the morning, and, not\nknowing any peculiar name it had, should call it hardened water; I ask\nwhether this would be a new species to him, different from water? And I\nthink it would be answered here, It would not be to him a new species,\nno more than congealed jelly, when it is cold, is a distinct species\nfrom the same jelly fluid and warm; or than liquid gold in the furnace\nis a distinct species from hard gold in the hands of a workman. And\nif this be so, it is plain that OUR DISTINCT SPECIES are NOTHING BUT\nDISTINCT COMPLEX IDEAS, WITH DISTINCT NAMES ANNEXED TO THEM. It is true\nevery substance that exists has its peculiar constitution, whereon\ndepend those sensible qualities and powers we observe in it; but the\nranking of things into species (which is nothing but sorting them under\nseveral titles) is done by us according to the ideas that WE have of\nthem: which, though sufficient to distinguish them by names, so that we\nmay be able to discourse of them when we have them not present\nbefore us; yet if we suppose it to be done by their real internal\nconstitutions, and that things existing are distinguished by nature into\nspecies, by real essences, according as we distinguish them into species\nby names, we shall be liable to great mistakes.\n14. Difficulties in the supposition of a certain number of real Essences\nTo distinguish substantial beings into species, according to the usual\nsupposition, that there are certain precise essences or forms of things,\nwhereby all the individuals existing are, by nature distinguished into\nspecies, these things are necessary:--\n15. A crude supposition.\nFirst, To be assured that nature, in the production of things, always\ndesigns them to partake of certain regulated established essences, which\nare to be the models of all things to be produced. This, in that crude\nsense it is usually proposed, would need some better explication, before\nit can fully be assented to.\n16. Monstrous births.\nSecondly, It would be necessary to know whether nature always attains\nthat essence it designs in the production of things. The irregular and\nmonstrous births, that in divers sorts of animals have been observed,\nwill always give us reason to doubt of one or both of these.\n17. Are monsters really a distinct species?\nThirdly, It ought to be determined whether those we call monsters be\nreally a distinct species, according to the scholastic notion of the\nword species; since it is certain that everything that exists has its\nparticular constitution. And yet we find that some of these monstrous\nproductions have few or none of those qualities which are supposed to\nresult from, and accompany, the essence of that species from whence they\nderive their originals, and to which, by their descent, they seem to\nbelong.\n18. Men can have no ideas of Real Essences.\nFourthly, The real essences of those things which we distinguish into\nspecies, and as so distinguished we name, ought to be known; i.e. we\nought to have ideas of them. But since we are ignorant in these four\npoints, the supposed real essences of things stand US not in stead for\nthe distinguishing substances into species.\n19. Our Nominal Essences of Substances not perfect collections of the\nproperties that flow from the Real Essence.\nFifthly, The only imaginable help in this case would be, that, having\nframed perfect complex ideas of the properties of things flowing from\ntheir different real essences, we should thereby distinguish them into\nspecies. But neither can this be done. For, being ignorant of the real\nessence itself, it is impossible to know all those properties that flow\nfrom it, and are so annexed to it, that any one of them being away, we\nmay certainly conclude that that essence is not there, and so the thing\nis not of that species. We can never know what is the precise number of\nproperties depending on the real essence of gold, any one of which\nfailing, the real essence of gold, and consequently gold, would not be\nthere, unless we knew the real essence of gold itself, and by that\ndetermined that species. By the word GOLD here, I must be understood to\ndesign a particular piece of matter; v. g. the last guinea that was\ncoined. For, if it should stand here, in its ordinary signification, for\nthat complex idea which I or any one else calls gold, i. e. for the\nnominal essence of gold, it would be jargon. So hard is it to show the\nvarious meaning and imperfection of words, when we have nothing else but\nwords to do it by.\n20. Hence names independent of Real Essence.\nBy all which it is clear, that our distinguishing substances into\nspecies by names, is not at all founded on their real essences; nor can\nwe pretend to range and determine them exactly into species, according\nto internal essential differences.\n21. But stand for such collections of simple ideas as we have made the\nName stand for.\nBut since, as has been remarked, we have need of GENERAL words, though\nwe know not the real essences of things; all we can do is, to collect\nsuch a number of simple ideas as, by examination, we find to be united\ntogether in things existing, and thereof to make one complex idea.\nWhich, though it be not the real essence of any substance that exists,\nis yet the specific essence to which our name belongs, and is\nconvertible with it; by which we may at least try the truth of these\nnominal essences. For example: there be that say that the essence of\nbody is EXTENSION; if it be so, we can never mistake in putting the\nessence of anything for the thing itself. Let us then in discourse put\nextension for body, and when we would say that body moves, let us say\nthat extension moves, and see how ill it will look. He that should say\nthat one extension by impulse moves another extension, would, by the\nbare expression, sufficiently show the absurdity of such a notion. The\nessence of anything in respect of us, is the whole complex idea\ncomprehended and marked by that name; and in substances, besides the\nseveral distinct simple ideas that make them up, the confused one of\nsubstance, or of an unknown support and cause of their union, is always\na part: and therefore the essence of body is not bare extension, but an\nextended solid thing; and so to say, an extended solid thing moves, or\nimpels another, is all one, and as intelligible, as to say, BODY moves\nor impels. Likewise, to say that a rational animal is capable of\nconversation, is all one as to say a man; but no one will say that\nrationality is capable of conversation, because it makes not the whole\nessence to which we give the name man.\n22. Our Abstract Ideas are to us the Measures of the Species we make in\ninstance in that of Man.\nThere are creatures in the world that have shapes like ours, but are\nhairy, and want language and reason. There are naturals amongst us that\nhave perfectly our shape, but want reason, and some of them language\ntoo. There are creatures, as it is said, (sit fides penes authorem, but\nthere appears no contradiction that there should be such,) that, with\nlanguage and reason and a shape in other things agreeing with ours, have\nhairy tails; others where the males have no beards, and others where\nthe females have. If it be asked whether these be all men or no, all\nof human species? it is plain, the question refers only to the nominal\nessence: for those of them to whom the definition of the word man, or\nthe complex idea signified by that name, agrees, are men, and the other\nnot. But if the inquiry be made concerning the supposed real essence;\nand whether the internal constitution and frame of these several\ncreatures be specifically different, it is wholly impossible for us\nto answer, no part of that going into our specific idea: only we have\nreason to think, that where the faculties or outward frame so much\ndiffers, the internal constitution is not exactly the same. But what\ndifference in the real internal constitution makes a specific difference\nit is in vain to inquire; whilst our measures of species be, as they\nare, only our abstract ideas, which we know; and not that internal\nconstitution, which makes no part of them. Shall the difference of hair\nonly on the skin be a mark of a different internal specific constitution\nbetween a changeling and a drill, when they agree in shape, and want of\nreason and speech? And shall not the want of reason and speech be a sign\nto us of different real constitutions and species between a changeling\nand a reasonable man? And so of the rest, if we pretend that distinction\nof species or sorts is fixedly established by the real frame and secret\nconstitutions of things.\n23. Species in Animals not distinguished by Generation.\nNor let any one say, that the power of propagation in animals by the\nmixture of male and female, and in plants by seeds, keeps the supposed\nreal species distinct and entire, For, granting this to be true, it\nwould help us in the distinction of the species of things no further\nthan the tribes of animals and vegetables. What must we do for the rest?\nBut in those too it is not sufficient: for if history lie not, women\nhave conceived by drills; and what real species, by that measure, such a\nproduction will be in nature will be a new question: and we have reason\nto think this is not impossible, since mules and jumarts, the one from\nthe mixture of an ass and a mare, the other from the mixture of a bull\nand a mare, are so frequent in the world. I once saw a creature that was\nthe issue of a cat and a rat, and had the plain marks of both about it;\nwherein nature appeared to have followed the pattern of neither sort\nalone, but to have jumbled them both together. To which he that shall\nadd the monstrous productions that are so frequently to be met with in\nnature, will find it hard, even in the race of animals, to determine by\nthe pedigree of what species every animal's issue is; and be at a\nloss about the real essence, which he thinks certainly conveyed by\ngeneration, and has alone a right to the specific name. But further,\nif the species of animals and plants are to be distinguished only by\npropagation, must I go to the Indies to see the sire and dam of the one,\nand the plant from which the seed was gathered that produced the other,\nto know whether this be a tiger or that tea?\n24. Not by substantial Forms.\nUpon the whole matter, it is evident that it is their own collections of\nsensible qualities that men make the essences of THEIR several sorts of\nsubstances; and that their real internal structures are not considered\nby the greatest part of men in the sorting them. Much less were any\nSUBSTANTIAL FORMS ever thought on by any but those who have in this one\npart of the world learned the language of the schools: and yet those\nignorant men, who pretend not any insight into the real essences, nor\ntrouble themselves about substantial forms, but are content with knowing\nthings one from another by their sensible qualities, are often better\nacquainted with their differences; can more nicely distinguish them\nfrom their uses; and better know what they expect from each, than those\nlearned quick-sighted men, who look so deep into them, and talk so\nconfidently of something more hidden and essential.\n25. The specific Essences that are common made by Men.\nBut supposing that the REAL essences of substances were discoverable by\nthose that would severely apply themselves to that inquiry, yet we could\nnot reasonably think that the ranking of things under general names was\nregulated by those internal real constitutions, or anything else but\ntheir OBVIOUS appearances; since languages, in all countries, have\nbeen established long before sciences. So that they have not been\nphilosophers or logicians, or such who have troubled themselves about\nforms and essences, that have made the general names that are in use\namongst the several nations of men: but those more or less comprehensive\nterms have, for the most part, in all languages, received their birth\nand signification from ignorant and illiterate people, who sorted\nand denominated things by those sensible qualities they found in them;\nthereby to signify them, when absent, to others, whether they had an\noccasion to mention a sort or a particular thing.\n26. Therefore very various and uncertain in the ideas of different men.\nSince then it is evident that we sort and name substances by their\nnominal and not by their real essences, the next thing to be considered\nis how, and by whom these essences come to be made. As to the latter, it\nis evident they are made by the mind, and not by nature: for were they\nNature's workmanship, they could not be so various and different in\nseveral men as experience tells us they are. For if we will examine it,\nwe shall not find the nominal essence of any one species of substances\nin all men the same: no, not of that which of all others we are the most\nintimately acquainted with. It could not possibly be that the abstract\nidea to which the name MAN is given should be different in several men,\nif it were of Nature's making; and that to one it should be animal\nrationale, and to another, animal implume bipes latis unguibus. He that\nannexes the name man to a complex idea, made up of sense and spontaneous\nmotion, joined to a body of such a shape, has thereby one essence of the\nspecies man; and he that, upon further examination, adds rationality,\nhas another essence of the species he calls man: by which means the same\nindividual will be a true man to the one which is not so to the other.\nI think there is scarce any one will allow this upright figure, so well\nknown, to be the essential difference of the species man; and yet how\nfar men determine of the sorts of animals rather by their shape than\ndescent, is very visible; since it has been more than once debated,\nwhether several human foetuses should be preserved or received to\nbaptism or no, only because of the difference of their outward\nconfiguration from the ordinary make of children, without knowing\nwhether they were not as capable of reason as infants cast in another\nmould: some whereof, though of an approved shape, are never capable of\nas much appearance of reason all their lives as is to be found in an\nape, or an elephant, and never give any signs of being acted by a\nrational soul. Whereby it is evident, that the outward figure, which\nonly was found wanting, and not the faculty of reason, which nobody\ncould know would be wanting in its due season, was made essential to the\nhuman species. The learned divine and lawyer must, on such occasions,\nrenounce his sacred definition of animal rationale, and substitute some\nother essence of the human species. [Monsieur Menage furnishes us with\nan example worth the taking notice of on this occasion: 'When the abbot\nof Saint Martin,' says he, 'was born, he had so little of the figure of\na man, that it bespake him rather a monster. It was for some time under\ndeliberation, whether he should be baptized or no. However, he was\nbaptized, and declared a man provisionally [till time should show what\nhe would prove]. Nature had moulded him so untowardly, that he was\ncalled all his life the Abbot Malotru; i.e. ill-shaped. He was of Caen.\n(Menagiana, 278, 430.) This child, we see, was very near being excluded\nout of the species of man, barely by his shape. He escaped very narrowly\nas he was; and it is certain, a figure a little more oddly turned had\ncast him, and he had been executed, as a thing not to be allowed to pass\nfor a man. And yet there can be no reason given why, if the lineaments\nof his face had been a little altered, a rational soul could not have\nbeen lodged in him; why a visage somewhat longer, or a nose flatter, or\na wider mouth, could not have consisted, as well as the rest of his ill\nfigure, with such a soul, such parts, as made him, disfigured as he was,\ncapable to be a dignitary in the church.]\n27. Nominal Essences of particular substances are undetermined by\nnature, and therefore various as men vary.\nWherein, then, would I gladly know, consist the precise and unmovable\nboundaries of that species? It is plain, if we examine, there is no\nsuch thing made by Nature, and established by her amongst men. The real\nessence of that or any other sort of substances, it is evident, we know\nnot; and therefore are so undetermined in our nominal essences, which we\nmake ourselves, that, if several men were to be asked concerning some\noddly-shaped foetus, as soon as born, whether it were a man or no, it\nis past doubt one should meet with different answers. Which could not\nhappen, if the nominal essences, whereby we limit and distinguish the\nspecies of substances, were not made by man with some liberty; but\nwere exactly copied from precise boundaries set by nature, whereby it\ndistinguished all substances into certain species. Who would undertake\nto resolve what species that monster was of which is mentioned by\nLicetus (lib. i. c. 3), with a man's head and hog's body? Or those other\nwhich to the bodies of men had the heads of beasts, as dogs, horses, &c.\nIf any of these creatures had lived, and could have spoke, it would have\nincreased the difficulty. Had the upper part to the middle been of human\nshape, and all below swine, had it been murder to destroy it? Or must\nthe bishop have been consulted, whether it were man enough to be\nadmitted to the font or no? As I have been told it happened in France\nsome years since, in somewhat a like case. So uncertain are the\nboundaries of species of animals to us, who have no other measures\nthan the complex ideas of our own collecting: and so far are we from\ncertainly knowing what a MAN is; though perhaps it will be judged great\nignorance to make any doubt about it. And yet I think I may say, that\nthe certain boundaries of that species are so far from being determined,\nand the precise number of simple ideas which make the nominal essence so\nfar from being settles and perfectly known, that very material doubts\nmay still arise about it. And I imagine none of the definitions of the\nword MAN which we yet have, nor descriptios of that sort of animal, are\nso perfect and exact as to satisfy a considerate inquisitive person;\nmuch less to obtain a general consent, and to be that which men would\neverywhere stick by, in the decision of cases, and determining of life\nand death, baptism or no baptism, in productions that mights happen.\n28. But not so arbitrary as Mixed Modes.\nBut though these nominal essences of substances are made by the mind,\nthey are not yet made so arbitrarily as those of mixed modes. To the\nmaking of any nominal essence, it is necessary, First, that the ideas\nwhereof it consists have such a union as to make but one idea, how\ncompounded soever. Secondly, that the particular ideas so united be\nexactly the same, neither more nor less. For if two abstract complex\nideas differ either in number or sorts of their component parts, they\nmake two different, and not one and the same essence. In the first of\nthese, the mind, in making its complex ideas of substances, only follows\nnature; and puts none together which are not supposed to have a union in\nnature. Nobody joins the voice of a sheep with the shape of a horse;\nnor the colour of lead with the weight and fixedness of gold, to be the\ncomplex ideas of any real substances; unless he has a mind to fill his\nhead with chimeras, and his discourse with unintelligible words. Men\nobserving certain qualities always joined and existing together, therein\ncopied nature; and of ideas so united made their complex ones of\nsubstances. For, though men may make what complex ideas they please, and\ngive what names to them they will; yet, if they will be understood WHEN\nTHEY SPEAK OF THINGS REALLY EXISTING, they must in some degree conform\ntheir ideas to the things they would speak of; or else men's language\nwill be like that of Babel; and every man's words, being intelligible\nonly to himself, would no longer serve to conversation and the ordinary\naffairs of life, if the ideas they stand for be not some way answering\nthe common appearances and agreement of substances as they really exist.\n29. Our Nominal Essences of substances usually consist of a few obvious\nqualities observed in things.\nSecondly, Though the mind of man, in making its complex ideas of\nsubstances, never puts any together that do not really, or are not\nsupposed to, co-exist; and so it truly borrows that union from nature:\nyet the number it combines depends upon the various care, industry, or\nfancy of him that makes it. Men generally content themselves with some\nfew sensible obvious qualities; and often, if not always, leave out\nothers as material and as firmly united as those that they take. Of\nsensible substances there are two sorts: one of organized bodies, which\nare propagated by seed; and in these the SHAPE is that which to us is\nthe leading quality, and most characteristical part, that determines\nthe species. And therefore in vegetables and animals, an extended solid\nsubstance of such a certain figure usually serves the turn. For however\nsome men seem to prize their definition of animal rationale, yet should\nthere a creature be found that had language and reason, but partaked not\nof the usual shape of a man, I believe it would hardly pass for a man,\nhow much soever it were animal rationale. And if Balaam's ass had all\nhis life discoursed as rationally as he did once with his master, I\ndoubt yet whether any one would have thought him worthy the name man, or\nallowed him to be of the same species with himself. As in vegetables\nand animals it is the shape, so in most other bodies, not propagated by\nseed, it is the COLOUR we most fix on, and are most led by. Thus\nwhere we find the colour of gold, we are apt to imagine all the other\nqualities comprehended in our complex idea to be there also: and we\ncommonly take these two obvious qualities, viz. shape and colour, for so\npresumptive ideas of several species, that in a good picture, we readily\nsay, this is a lion, and that a rose; this is a gold, and that a silver\ngoblet, only by the different figures and colours represented to the eye\nby the pencil.\n30. Yet, imperfect as they thus are, they serve for common converse.\nBut though this serves well enough for gross and confused conceptions,\nand inaccurate ways of talking and thinking; yet MEN ARE FAR ENOUGH\nFROM HAVING AGREED ON THE PRECISE NUMBER OF SIMPLE IDEAS OR QUALITIES\nBELONGING TO ANY SORT OF THINGS, SIGNIFIED BY ITS NAME. Nor is it a\nwonder; since it requires much time, pains, and skill, strict inquiry,\nand long examination to find out what, and how many, those simple ideas\nare, which are constantly and inseparably united in nature, and are\nalways to be found together in the same subject. Most men, wanting\neither time, inclination, or industry enough for this, even to some\ntolerable degree, content themselves with some few obvious and outward\nappearances of things, thereby readily to distinguish and sort them for\nthe common affairs of life: and so, without further examination, give\nthem names, or take up the names already in use. Which, though in common\nconversation they pass well enough for the signs of some few obvious\nqualities co-existing, are yet far enough from comprehending, in a\nsettled signification, a precise number of simple ideas, much less all\nthose which are united in nature. He that shall consider, after so\nmuch stir about genus and species, and such a deal of talk of specific\ndifferences, how few words we have yet settled definitions of, may with\nreason imagine, that those FORMS which there hath been so much noise\nmade about are only chimeras, which give us no light into the specific\nnatures of things. And he that shall consider how far the names of\nsubstances are from having significations wherein all who use them do\nagree, will have reason to conclude that, though the nominal essences of\nsubstances are all supposed to be copied from nature, yet they are all,\nor most of them, very imperfect. Since the composition of those complex\nideas are, in several men, very different: and therefore that these\nboundaries of species are as men, and not as Nature, makes them, if at\nleast there are in nature any such prefixed bounds. It is true that many\nparticular substances are so made by Nature, that they have agreement\nand likeness one with another, and so afford a foundation of being\nranked into sorts. But the sorting of things by us, or the making of\ndeterminate species, being in order to naming and comprehending them\nunder general terms, I cannot see how it can be properly said, that\nNature sets the boundaries of the species of things: or, if it be so,\nour boundaries of species are not exactly conformable to those in\nnature. For we, having need of general names for present use, stay not\nfor a perfect discovery of all those qualities which would BEST show us\ntheir most material differences and agreements; but we ourselves divide\nthem, by certain obvious appearances, into species, that we may the\neasier under general names communicate our thoughts about them. For,\nhaving no other knowledge of any substance but of the simple ideas that\nare united in it; and observing several particular things to agree with\nothers in several of those simple ideas; we make that collection our\nspecific idea, and give it a general name; that in recording our\nthoughts, and in our discourse with others, we may in one short word\ndesignate all the individuals that agree in that complex idea, without\nenumerating the simple ideas that make it up; and so not waste our time\nand breath in tedious descriptions: which we see they are fain to do who\nwould discourse of any new sort of things they have not yet a name for.\n31. Essences of Species under the same Name very different in different\nminds.\nBut however these species of substances pass well enough in ordinary\nconversation, it is plain that this complex idea wherein they observe\nseveral individuals to agree, is by different men made very differently;\nby some more, and others less accurately. In some, this complex idea\ncontains a greater, and in others a smaller number of qualities; and so\nis apparently such as the mind makes it. The yellow shining colour makes\ngold to children; others add weight, malleableness, and fusibility; and\nothers yet other qualities, which they find joined with that yellow\ncolour, as constantly as its weight and fusibility. For in all these and\nthe like qualities, one has as good a right to be put into the complex\nidea of that substance wherein they are all joined as another. And\ntherefore different men, leaving out or putting in several simple ideas\nwhich others do not, according to their various examination, skill, or\nobservation of that subject, have different essences of gold, which must\ntherefore be of their own and not of nature's making.\n32. The more general our Ideas of Substances are, the more incomplete\nand partial they are.\nIf the number of simple ideas that make the nominal essence of the\nlowest species, or first sorting, of individuals, depends on the mind of\nman, variously collecting them, it is much more evident that they do so\nin the more comprehensive classes, which, by the masters of logic, are\ncalled genera. These are complex ideas designedly imperfect: and it is\nvisible at first sight, that several of those qualities that are to\nbe found in the things themselves are purposely left out of generical\nideas. For, as the mind, to make general ideas comprehending several\nparticulars, leaves out those of time and place, and such other, that\nmake them incommunicable to more than one individual; so to make other\nyet more general ideas, that may comprehend different sorts, it leaves\nout those qualities that distinguish them, and puts into its new\ncollection only such ideas as are common to several sorts. The same\nconvenience that made men express several parcels of yellow matter\ncoming from Guinea and Peru under one name, sets them also upon making\nof one name that may comprehend both gold and silver, and some other\nbodies of different sorts. This is done by leaving out those qualities,\nwhich are peculiar to each sort, and retaining a complex idea made up\nof those that are common to them all. To which the name METAL being\nannexed, there is a genus constituted; the essence whereof being that\nabstract idea, containing only malleableness and fusibility, with\ncertain degrees of weight and fixedness, wherein some bodies of several\nkinds agree, leaves out the colour and other qualities peculiar to gold\nand silver, and the other sorts comprehended under the name metal.\nWhereby it is plain that men follow not exactly the patterns set them by\nnature, when they make their general ideas of substances; since there is\nno body to be found which has barely malleableness and fusibility in\nit, without other qualities as inseparable as those. But men, in making\ntheir general ideas, seeking more the convenience of language, and quick\ndispatch by short and comprehensive signs, than the true and precise\nnature of things as they exist, have, in the framing their abstract\nideas, chiefly pursued that end; which was to be furnished with store\nof general and variously comprehensive names. So that in this whole\nbusiness of genera and species, the genus, or more comprehensive, is but\na partial conception of what is in the species; and the species but a\npartial idea of what is to be found in each individual. If therefore any\none will think that a man, and a horse, and an animal, and a plant, &c.,\nare distinguished by real essences made by nature, he must think nature\nto be very liberal of these real essences, making one for body, another\nfor an animal, and another for a horse; and all these essences liberally\nbestowed upon Bucephalus. But if we would rightly consider what is done\nin all these genera and species, or sorts, we should find that there is\nno new thing made; but only more or less comprehensive signs, whereby we\nmay be enabled to express in a few syllables great numbers of particular\nthings, as they agree in more or less general conceptions, which we\nhave framed to that purpose. In all which we may observe, that the more\ngeneral term is always the name of a less complex idea; and that each\ngenus is but a partial conception of; the species comprehended under it.\nSo that if these abstract general ideas be thought to be complete, it\ncan only be in respect of a certain established relation between them\nand certain names which are made use of to signify them; and not in\nrespect of anything existing, as made by nature.\n33. This all accommodated to the end of the Speech.\nThis is adjusted to the true end of speech, which is to be the easiest\nand shortest way of communicating our notions. For thus he that would\ndiscourse of things, as they agreed in the complex idea of extension and\nsolidity, needed but use the word BODY to denote all such. He that\nto these would join others, signified by the words life, sense, and\nspontaneous motion, needed but use the word ANIMAL to signify all which\npartaked of those ideas, and he that had made a complex idea of a body,\nwith life, sense, and motion, with the faculty of reasoning, and a\ncertain shape joined to it, needed but use the short monosyllable MAN,\nto express all particulars that correspond to that complex idea. This is\nthe proper business of genus and species: and this men do without any\nconsideration of real essences, or substantial forms; which come not\nwithin the reach of our knowledge when we think of those things, nor\nwithin the signification of our words when we discourse with others.\n34. Instance in Cassowaries.\nWere I to talk with any one of a sort of birds I lately saw in St.\nJames's Park, about three or four feet high, with a covering of\nsomething between feathers and hair, of a dark brown colour, without\nwings, but in the place thereof two or three little branches coming down\nlike sprigs of Spanish broom, long great legs, with feet only of three\nclaws, and without a tail; I must make this description of it, and so\nmay make others understand me. But when I am told that the name of it\nis CASSUARIS, I may then use that word to stand in discourse for all my\ncomplex idea mentioned in that description; though by that word, which\nis now become a specific name, I know no more of the real essence\nor constitution of that sort of animals than I did before; and knew\nprobably as much of the nature of that species of birds before I learned\nthe name, as many Englishmen do of swans or herons, which are specific\nnames, very well known, of sorts of birds common in England.\n35. Men determine the Sorts of Substances, which may be sorted\nvariously.\nFrom what has been said, it is evident that MEN make sorts of things.\nFor, it being different essences alone that make different species, it\nis plain that they who make those abstract ideas which are the nominal\nessences do thereby make the species, or sort. Should there be a body\nfound, having all the other qualities of gold except malleableness, it\nwould no doubt be made a question whether it were gold or not, i.e.\nwhether it were of that species. This could be determined only by that\nabstract idea to which every one annexed the name gold: so that it\nwould be true gold to him, and belong to that species, who included not\nmalleableness in his nominal essence, signified by the sound gold; and\non the other side it would not be true gold, or of that species, to him\nwho included malleableness in his specific idea. And who, I pray, is it\nthat makes these diverse species, even under one and the same name, but\nmen that make two different abstract ideas, consisting not exactly\nof the same collection of qualities? Nor is it a mere supposition to\nimagine that a body may exist wherein the other obvious qualities of\ngold may be without malleableness; since it is certain that gold itself\nwill be sometimes so eager, (as artists call it,) that it will as little\nendure the hammer as glass itself. What we have said of the putting in,\nor leaving out of malleableness, in the complex idea the name gold is by\nany one annexed to, may be said of its peculiar weight, fixedness, and\nseveral other the like qualities: for whatever is left out, or put in,\nit is still the complex idea to which that name is annexed that makes\nthe species: and as any particular parcel of matter answers that idea,\nso the name of the sort belongs truly to it; and it is of that species.\nAnd thus anything is true gold, perfect metal. All which determination\nof the species, it is plain, depends on the understanding of man, making\nthis or that complex idea.\n36. Nature makes the Similitudes of Substances.\nThis, then, in short, is the case: Nature makes many PARTICULAR THINGS,\nwhich do agree one with another in many sensible qualities, and probably\ntoo in their internal frame and constitution: but it is not this real\nessence that distinguishes them into species; it is men who, taking\noccasion from the qualities they find united in them, and wherein they\nobserve often several individuals to agree, range them into sorts, in\norder to their naming, for the convenience of comprehensive signs;\nunder which individuals, according to their conformity to this or that\nabstract idea, come to be ranked as under ensigns: so that this is of\nthe blue, that the red regiment; this is a man, that a drill: and in\nthis, I think, consists the whole business of genus and species.\n37. The manner of sorting particular beings the work of fallible men,\nthough nature makes things alike.\nI do not deny but nature, in the constant production of particular\nbeings, makes them not always new and various, but very much alike\nand of kin one to another: but I think it nevertheless true, that the\nboundaries of the species, whereby men sort them, are made by men; since\nthe essences of the species, distinguished by different names, are, as\nhas been proved, of man's making, and seldom adequate to the internal\nnature of the things they are taken from. So that we may truly say, such\na manner of sorting of things is the workmanship of men.\n38. Each abstract Idea, with a name to it, makes a nominal Essence.\nOne thing I doubt not but will seem very strange in this doctrine, which\nis, that from what has been said it will follow, that each abstract\nidea, with a name to it, makes a distinct species. But who can help it,\nif truth will have it so? For so it must remain till somebody can show\nus the species of things limited and distinguished by something else;\nand let us see that general terms signify not our abstract ideas, but\nsomething different from them. I would fain know why a shock and a hound\nare not as distinct species as a spaniel and an elephant. We have no\nother idea of the different essence of an elephant and a spaniel,\nthan we have of the different essence of a shock and a hound; all the\nessential difference, whereby we know and distinguish them one from\nanother, consisting only in the different collection of simple ideas, to\nwhich we have given those different names.\n39. How Genera and Species are related to naming.\nHow much the making of species and genera is in order to general names;\nand how much general names are necessary, if not to the being, yet at\nleast to the completing of a species, and making it pass for such, will\nappear, besides what has been said above concerning ice and water, in\na very familiar example. A silent and a striking watch are but one\nspecies, to those who have but one name for them: but he that has the\nname WATCH for one, and CLOCK for the other, and distinct complex ideas\nto which those names belong, to HIM they are different species. It\nwill be said perhaps, that the inward contrivance and constitution is\ndifferent between these two, which the watchmaker has a clear idea of.\nAnd yet it is plain they are but one species to him, when he has but one\nname for them. For what is sufficient in the inward contrivance to make\na new species? There are some watches that are made with four wheels,\nothers with five; is this a specific difference to the workman? Some\nhave strings and physics, and others none; some have the balance loose,\nand others regulated by a spiral spring, and others by hogs' bristles.\nAre any or all of these enough to make a specific difference to\nthe workman, that knows each of these and several other different\ncontrivances in the internal constitutions of watches? It is certain\neach of these hath a real difference from the rest; but whether it be an\nessential, a specific difference or no, relates only to the complex idea\nto which the name watch is given: as long as they all agree in the idea\nwhich that name stands for, and that name does not as a generical name\ncomprehend different species under it, they are not essentially nor\nspecifically different. But if any one will make minuter divisions, from\ndifferences that he knows in the internal frame of watches, and to such\nprecise complex ideas give names that shall prevail; they will then be\nnew species, to them who have those ideas with names to them, and can by\nthose differences distinguish watches into these several sorts; and\nthen WATCH will be a generical name. But yet they would be no distinct\nspecies to men ignorant of clock-work, and the inward contrivances of\nwatches, who had no other idea but the outward shape and bulk, with the\nmarking of the hours by the hand. For to them all those other names\nwould be but synonymous terms for the same idea, and signify no more,\nnor no other thing but a watch. Just thus I think it is in natural\nthings. Nobody will doubt that the wheels or springs (if I may so say)\nwithin, are different in a RATIONAL MAN and a CHANGELING; no more\nthan that there is a difference in the frame between a DRILL and a\nCHANGELING. But whether one or both these differences be essential or\nspecifical, is only to be known to us by their agreement or disagreement\nwith the complex idea that the name man stands for: for by that alone\ncan it be determined whether one, or both, or neither of those be a man.\n40. Species of Artificial Things less confused than Natural.\nFrom what has been before said, we may see the reason why, in the\nspecies of artificial things, there is generally less confusion and\nuncertainty than in natural. Because an artificial thing being a\nproduction of man, which the artificer designed, and therefore well\nknows the idea of, the name of it is supposed to stand for no other\nidea, nor to import any other essence, than what is certainly to be\nknown, and easy enough to be apprehended. For the idea or essence of\nthe several sorts of artificial things, consisting for the most part\nin nothing but the determinate figure of sensible parts, and sometimes\nmotion depending thereon, which the artificer fashions in matter, such\nas he finds for his turn; it is not beyond the reach of our faculties to\nattain a certain idea thereof; and so settle the signification of the\nnames whereby the species of artificial things are distinguished, with\nless doubt, obscurity, and equivocation than we can in things natural,\nwhose differences and operations depend upon contrivances beyond the\nreach of our discoveries.\n41. Artificial Things of distinct Species.\nI must be excused here if I think artificial things are of distinct\nspecies as well as natural: since I find they are as plainly and orderly\nranked into sorts, by different abstract ideas, with general names\nannexed to them, as distinct one from another as those of natural\nsubstances. For why should we not think a watch and pistol as distinct\nspecies one from another, as a horse and a dog; they being expressed in\nour minds by distinct ideas, and to others by distinct appellations?\n42. Substances alone, of all our several sorts of ideas, have proper\nNames.\nThis is further to be observed concerning substances, that they alone of\nall our several sorts of ideas have particular or proper names, whereby\none only particular thing is signified. Because in simple ideas, modes,\nand relations, it seldom happens that men have occasion to mention often\nthis or that particular when it is absent. Besides, the greatest part of\nmixed modes, being actions which perish in their birth, are not capable\nof a lasting duration, as substances which are the actors; and wherein\nthe simple ideas that make up the complex ideas designed by the name\nhave a lasting union.\n43. Difficult to lead another by words into the thoughts of things\nstripped of those abstract ideas we give them.\nI must beg pardon of my reader for having dwelt so long upon this\nsubject, and perhaps with some obscurity. But I desire it may be\nconsidered, how difficult it is to lead another by words into the\nthoughts of things, stripped of those specifical differences we give\nthem: which things, if I name not, I say nothing; and if I do name them,\nI thereby rank them into some sort or other, and suggest to the mind the\nusual abstract idea of that species; and so cross my purpose. For,\nto talk of a man, and to lay by, at the same time, the ordinary\nsignification of the name man, which is our complex idea usually annexed\nto it; and bid the reader consider man, as he is in himself, and as he\nis really distinguished from others in his internal constitution, or\nreal essence, that is, by something he knows not what, looks like\ntrifling: and yet thus one must do who would speak of the supposed real\nessences and species of things, as thought to be made by nature, if it\nbe but only to make it understood, that there is no such thing signified\nby the general names which substances are called by. But because it is\ndifficult by known familiar names to do this, give me leave to endeavour\nby an example to make the different consideration the mind has of\nspecific names and ideas a little more clear; and to show how the\ncomplex ideas of modes are referred sometimes to archetypes in the minds\nof other intelligent beings, or, which is the same, to the signification\nannexed by others to their received names; and sometimes to no\narchetypes at all. Give me leave also to show how the mind always refers\nits ideas of substances, either to the substances themselves, or to the\nsignification of their names, as to the archetypes; and also to make\nplain the nature of species or sorting of things, as apprehended and\nmade use of by us; and of the essences belonging to those species: which\nis perhaps of more moment to discover the extent and certainty of our\nknowledge than we at first imagine.\n44. Instances of mixed Modes names KINNEAH and NIOUPH.\nLet us suppose Adam, in the state of a grown man, with a good\nunderstanding, but in a strange country, with all things new and unknown\nabout him; and no other faculties to attain the knowledge of them but\nwhat one of this age has now. He observes Lamech more melancholy than\nusual, and imagines it to be from a suspicion he has of his wife Adah,\n(whom he most ardently loved) that she had too much kindness for another\nman. Adam discourses these his thoughts to Eve, and desires her to take\ncare that Adah commit not folly: and in these discourses with Eve he\nmakes use of these two new words KINNEAH and NIOUPH. In time, Adam's\nmistake appears, for he finds Lamech's trouble proceeded from having\nkilled a man: but yet the two names KINNEAH and NIOUPH, (the one\nstanding for suspicion in a husband of his wife's disloyalty to him; and\nthe other for the act of committing disloyalty,) lost not their distinct\nsignifications. It is plain then, that here were two distinct complex\nideas of mixed modes, with names to them, two distinct species of\nactions essentially different; I ask wherein consisted the essences of\nthese two distinct species of actions? And it is plain it consisted in a\nprecise combination of simple ideas, different in one from the other. I\nask, whether the complex idea in Adam's mind, which he called KINNEAH,\nwere adequate or not? And it is plain it was; for it being a combination\nof simple ideas, which he, without any regard to any archetype, without\nrespect to anything as a pattern, voluntarily put together, abstracted,\nand gave the name KINNEAH to, to express in short to others, by that one\nsound, all the simple ideas contained and united in that complex one;\nit must necessarily follow that it was an adequate idea. His own choice\nhaving made that combination, it had all in it he intended it should,\nand so could not but be perfect, could not but be adequate; it being\nreferred to no other archetype which it was supposed to represent.\n45. These words, KINNEAH and NIOUPH, by degrees grew into common use,\nand then the case was somewhat altered. Adam's children had the same\nfaculties, and thereby the same power that he had, to make what complex\nideas of mixed modes they pleased in their own minds; to abstract them,\nand make what sounds they pleased the signs of them: but the use of\nnames being to make our ideas within us known to others, that cannot be\ndone, but when the same sign stands for the same idea in two who would\ncommunicate their thoughts and discourse together. Those, therefore,\nof Adam's children, that found these two words, KINNEAH and NIOUPH, in\nfamiliar use, could not take them for insignificant sounds, but must\nneeds conclude they stood for something; for certain ideas, abstract\nideas, they being general names; which abstract ideas were the essences\nof the species distinguished by those names. If therefore, they would\nuse these words as names of species already established and agreed on,\nthey were obliged to conform the ideas in their minds, signified by\nthese names, to the ideas that they stood for in other men's minds, as\nto their patterns and archetypes; and then indeed their ideas of\nthese complex modes were liable to be inadequate, as being very apt\n(especially those that consisted of combinations of many simple ideas)\nnot to be exactly conformable to the ideas in other men's minds, using\nthe same names; though for this there be usually a remedy at hand, which\nis to ask the meaning of any word we understand not of him that uses it:\nit being as impossible to know certainly what the words jealousy and\nadultery (which I think answer [Hebrew] and [Hebrew]) stand for in\nanother man's mind, with whom I would discourse about them; as it was\nimpossible, in the beginning of language, to know what KINNEAH and\nNIOUPH stood for in another man's mind, without explication; they being\nvoluntary signs in every one.\n46. Instances of a species of Substance named ZAHAB.\nLet us now also consider, after the same manner, the names of substances\nin their first application. One of Adam's children, roving in the\nmountains, lights on a glittering substance which pleases his eye. Home\nhe carries it to Adam, who, upon consideration of it, finds it to be\nhard, to have a bright yellow colour, and an exceeding great weight.\nThese perhaps, at first, are all the qualities he takes notice of in it;\nand abstracting this complex idea, consisting of a substance having that\npeculiar bright yellowness, and a weight very great in proportion to its\nbulk, he gives the name ZAHAB, to denominate and mark all substances\nthat have these sensible qualities in them. It is evident now, that,\nin this case, Adam acts quite differently from what he did before, in\nforming those ideas of mixed modes to which he gave the names KINNEAH\nand NIOUPH. For there he put ideas together only by his own imagination,\nnot taken from the existence of anything; and to them he gave names to\ndenominate all things that should happen to agree to those his abstract\nideas, without considering whether any such thing did exist or not: the\nstandard there was of his own making. But in the forming his idea of\nthis new substance, he takes the quite contrary course; here he has\na standard made by nature; and therefore, being to represent that to\nhimself, by the idea he has of it, even when it is absent, he puts in no\nsimple idea into his complex one, but what he has the perception of from\nthe thing itself. He takes care that his idea be conformable to this\narchetype, and intends the name should stand for an idea so conformable.\n47.\nThis piece of matter, thus denominated ZAHAB by Adam, being quite\ndifferent from any he had seen before, nobody, I think, will deny to be\na distinct species, and to have its peculiar essence; and that the name\nZAHAB is the mark of the species, and a name belonging to all things\npartaking in that essence. But here it is plain the essence Adam made\nthe name ZAHAB stand for was nothing but a body hard, shining, yellow,\nand very heavy. But the inquisitive mind of man, not content with the\nknowledge of these, as I may say, superficial qualities, puts Adam upon\nfurther examination of this matter. He therefore knocks, and beats it\nwith flints, to see what was discoverable in the inside: he finds it\nyield to blows, but not easily separate into pieces: he finds it will\nbend without breaking. Is not now ductility to be added to his former\nidea, and made part of the essence of the species that name ZAHAB stands\nfor? Further trials discover fusibility and fixedness. Are not they\nalso, by the same reason that any of the others were, to be put into the\ncomplex idea signified by the name ZAHAB? If not, what reason will there\nbe shown more for the one than the other? If these must, then all the\nother properties, which any further trials shall discover in this\nmatter, ought by the same reason to make a part of the ingredients of\nthe complex idea which the name ZAHAB stands for, and so be the essence\nof the species marked by that name. Which properties, because they are\nendless, it is plain that the idea made after this fashion, by this\narchetype, will be always inadequate.\n48. The Abstract Ideas of Substances always imperfect and therefore\nvarious.\nBut this is not all. It would also follow that the names of substances\nwould not only have, as in truth they have, but would also be supposed\nto have different significations, as used by different men, which would\nvery much cumber the use of language. For if every distinct quality\nthat were discovered in any matter by any one were supposed to make a\nnecessary part of the complex idea signified by the common name given\nto it, it must follow, that men must suppose the same word to signify\ndifferent things in different men: since they cannot doubt but different\nmen may have discovered several qualities, in substances of the same\ndenomination, which others know nothing of.\n49. Therefore to fix the Nominal Species Real Essence supposed.\nTo avoid this therefore, they have supposed a real essence belonging to\nevery species, from which these properties all flow, and would have\ntheir name of the species stand for that. But they, not having any idea\nof that real essence in substances, and their words signifying nothing\nbut the ideas they have, that which is done by this attempt is only to\nput the name or sound in the place and stead of the thing having that\nreal essence, without knowing what the real essence is, and this is that\nwhich men do when they speak of species of things, as supposing them\nmade by nature, and distinguished by real essences.\n50. Which Supposition is of no Use.\nFor, let us consider, when we affirm that 'all gold is fixed,' either\nit means that fixedness is a part of the definition, i. e., part of the\nnominal essence the word gold stands for; and so this affirmation, 'all\ngold is fixed,' contains nothing but the signification of the term gold.\nOr else it means, that fixedness, not being a part of the definition of\nthe gold, is a property of that substance itself: in which case it is\nplain that the word gold stands in the place of a substance, having the\nreal essence of a species of things made by nature. In which way of\nsubstitution it has so confused and uncertain a signification,\nthat, though this proposition--'gold is fixed'--be in that sense an\naffirmation of something real; yet it is a truth will always fail us in\nits particular application, and so is of no real use or certainty. For\nlet it be ever so true, that all gold, i. e. all that has the real\nessence of gold, is fixed, what serves this for, whilst we know not, in\nthis sense, WHAT IS OR IS NOT GOLD? For if we know not the real essence\nof gold, it is impossible we should know what parcel of matter has that\nessence, and so whether IT be true gold or no.\n51. Conclusion.\nTo conclude: what liberty Adam had at first to make any complex ideas of\nMIXED MODES by no other pattern but by his own thoughts, the same have\nall men ever since had. And the same necessity of conforming his ideas\nof SUBSTANCES to things without him, as to archetypes made by nature,\nthat Adam was under, if he would not wilfully impose upon himself, the\nsame are all men ever since under too. The same liberty also that Adam\nhad of affixing any new name to any idea, the same has any one still,\n(especially the beginners of languages, if we can imagine any such;) but\nonly with this difference, that, in places where men in society have\nalready established a language amongst them, the significations of words\nare very warily and sparingly to be altered. Because men being furnished\nalready with names for their ideas, and common use having appropriated\nknown names to certain ideas, an affected misapplication of them cannot\nbut be very ridiculous. He that hath new notions will perhaps venture\nsometimes on the coining of new terms to express them: but men think it\na boldness, and it is uncertain whether common use will ever make them\npass for current. But in communication with others, it is necessary that\nwe conform the ideas we make the vulgar words of any language stand for\nto their known proper significations, (which I have explained at large\nalready,) or else to make known that new signification we apply them to.\nCHAPTER VII.\nOF PARTICLES.\n1. Particles connect Parts, or whole Sentences together.\nBesides words which are names of ideas in the mind, there are a great\nmany others that are made use of to signify the CONNEXION that the mind\ngives to ideas, or to propositions, one with another. The mind, in\ncommunicating its thoughts to others, does not only need signs of the\nideas it has then before it, but others also, to show or intimate some\nparticular action of its own, at that time, relating to those ideas.\nThis it does several ways; as _I_S and _I_S NOT, are the general marks,\nof the mind, affirming or denying. But besides affirmation or negation,\nwithout which there is in words no truth or falsehood, the mind does,\nin declaring its sentiments to others, connect not only the parts of\npropositions, but whole sentences one to another, with their several\nrelations and dependencies, to make a coherent discourse.\n2. In right use of Particles consists the Art of Well-speaking\nThe words whereby it signifies what connexion it gives to the several\naffirmations and negations, that it unites in one continued reasoning or\nnarration, are generally called PARTICLES: and it is in the right use of\nthese that more particularly consists the clearness and beauty of a good\nstyle. To think well, it is not enough that a man has ideas clear\nand distinct in his thoughts, nor that he observes the agreement or\ndisagreement of some of them; but he must think in train, and observe\nthe dependence of his thoughts and reasonings upon one another. And to\nexpress well such methodical and rational thoughts, he must have words\nto show what connexion, restriction, distinction, opposition, emphasis,\n&c., he gives to each respective part of his discourse. To mistake\nin any of these, is to puzzle instead of informing his hearer: and\ntherefore it is, that those words which are not truly by themselves\nthe names of any ideas are of such constant and indispensable use in\nlanguage, and do much contribute to men's well expressing themselves.\n3. They say what Relation the Mind gives to its own Thoughts.\nThis part of grammar has been perhaps as much neglected as some others\nover-diligently cultivated. It is easy for men to write, one after\nanother, of cases and genders, moods and tenses, gerunds and supines: in\nthese and the like there has been great diligence used; and particles\nthemselves, in some languages, have been, with great show of exactness,\nranked into their several orders. But though PREPOSITIONS and\nCONJUNCTIONS, &c., are names well known in grammar, and the particles\ncontained under them carefully ranked into their distinct subdivisions;\nyet he who would show the right use of particles, and what significancy\nand force they have, must take a little more pains, enter into his\nown thoughts, and observe nicely the several postures of his mind in\ndiscoursing.\n4. They are all marks of some action or intimation of the mind.\nNeither is it enough, for the explaining of these words, to render them,\nas is usual in dictionaries, by words of another tongue which come\nnearest to their signification: for what is meant by them is commonly as\nhard to be understood in one as another language. They are all marks of\nsome action or intimation of the mind; and therefore to understand them\nrightly, the several views, postures, stands, turns, limitations, and\nexceptions, and several other thoughts of the mind, for which we have\neither none or very deficient names, are diligently to be studied. Of\nthese there is a great variety, much exceeding the number of particles\nthat most languages have to express them by: and therefore it is not\nto be wondered that most of these particles have divers and sometimes\nalmost opposite significations. In the Hebrew tongue there is a particle\nconsisting of but one single letter, of which there are reckoned up, as\nI remember, seventy, I am sure above fifty, several significations.\n5. Instance in But.\n'But' is a particle, none more familiar in our language: and he that\nsays it is a discretive conjunction, and that it answers to sed Latin,\nor mais in French, thinks he has sufficiently explained it. But yet it\nseems to me to intimate several relations the mind gives to the several\npropositions or parts of them which it joins by this monosyllable.\nFirst, 'But to say no more:' here it intimates a stop of the mind in the\ncourse it was going, before it came quite to the end of it.\nSecondly, 'I saw but two plants;' here it shows that the mind limits the\nsense to what is expressed, with a negation of all other.\nThirdly,'You pray; but it is not that God would bring you to the true\nreligion.'\nFourthly, 'But that he would confirm you in your own.' The first of\nthese BUTS intimates a supposition in the mind of something otherwise\nthan it should be; the latter shows that the mind makes a direct\nopposition between that and what goes before it.\nFifthly, 'All animals have sense, but a dog is an animal:' here it\nsignifies little more but that the latter proposition is joined to the\nformer, as the minor of a syllogism.\n6. This Matter of the use of Particles but lightly touched here.\nTo these, I doubt not, might be added a great many other significations\nof this particle, if it were my business to examine it in its full\nlatitude, and consider it in all the places it is to be found: which if\none should do, I doubt whether in all those manners it is made use of,\nit would deserve the title of DISCRETIVE, which grammarians give to it.\nBut I intend not here a full explication of this sort of signs. The\ninstances I have given in this one may give occasion to reflect on their\nuse and force in language, and lead us into the contemplation of several\nactions of our minds in discoursing, which it has found a way to\nintimate to others by these particles, some whereof constantly, and\nothers in certain constructions, have the sense of a whole sentence\ncontained in them.\nCHAPTER VIII.\nOF ABSTRACT AND CONCRETE TERMS.\n1. Abstract Terms predicated one on another and why.\nThe ordinary words of language, and our common use of them, would have\ngiven us light into the nature of our ideas, if they had been but\nconsidered with attention. The mind, as has been shown, has a power\nto abstract its ideas, and so they become essences, general essences,\nwhereby the sorts of things are distinguished. Now each abstract idea\nbeing distinct, so that of any two the one can never be the other, the\nmind will, by its intuitive knowledge, perceive their difference, and\ntherefore in propositions no two whole ideas can ever be affirmed one of\nanother. This we see in the common use of language, which permits not\nany two abstract words, or names of abstract ideas, to be affirmed one\nof another. For how near of kin soever they may seem to be, and how\ncertain soever it is that man is an animal, or rational, or white,\nyet every one at first hearing perceives the falsehood of these\npropositions: HUMANITY IS ANIMALITY, or RATIONALITY, or WHITENESS:\nand this is as evident as any of the most allowed maxims. All our\naffirmations then are only in concrete, which is the affirming, not\none abstract idea to be another, but one abstract idea to be joined to\nanother; which abstract ideas, in substances, may be of any sort; in all\nthe rest are little else but of relations; and in substances the most\nfrequent are of powers: v.g. 'a man is white,' signifies that the thing\nthat has the essence of a man has also in it the essence of whiteness,\nwhich is nothing but a power to produce the idea of whiteness in one\nwhose eyes can discover ordinary objects: or, 'a man is rational,'\nsignifies that the same thing that hath the essence of a man hath also\nin it the essence of rationality, i.e. a power of reasoning.\n2. They show the Difference of our Ideas.\nThis distinction of names shows us also the difference of our ideas:\nfor if we observe them, we shall find that OUR SIMPLE IDEAS HAVE ALL\nABSTRACT AS WELL AS CONCRETE NAMES: the one whereof is (to speak the\nlanguage of grammarians) a substantive, the other an adjective; as\nwhiteness, white; sweetness, sweet. The like also holds in our ideas of\nmodes and relations; as justice, just; equality, equal: only with this\ndifference, that some of the concrete names of relations amongst men\nchiefly are substantives; as, paternitas, pater; whereof it were easy to\nrender a reason. But as to our ideas of substances, we have very few\nor no abstract names at all. For though the Schools have introduced\nanimalitas, humanitas, corporietas, and some others; yet they hold no\nproportion with that infinite number of names of substances, to which\nthey never were ridiculous enough to attempt the coining of abstract\nones: and those few that the Schools forged, and put into the mouths\nof their scholars, could never yet get admittance into common use, or\nobtain the license of public approbation. Which seems to me at least to\nintimate the confession of all mankind, that they have no ideas of the\nreal essences of substances, since they have not names for such ideas:\nwhich no doubt they would have had, had not their consciousness to\nthemselves of their ignorance of them kept them from so idle an attempt.\nAnd therefore, though they had ideas enough to distinguish gold from a\nstone, and metal from wood; yet they but timorously ventured on such\nterms, as aurietas and saxietas, metallietas and lignietas, or the\nlike names, which should pretend to signify the real essences of those\nsubstances whereof they knew they had no ideas. And indeed it was only\nthe doctrine of SUBSTANTIAL FORMS, and the confidence of mistaken\npretenders to a knowledge that they had not, which first coined and then\nintroduced animalitas and humanitas, and the like; which yet went very\nlittle further than their own Schools, and could never get to be current\namongst understanding men. Indeed, humanitas was a word in familiar use\namongst the Romans; but in a far different sense, and stood not for the\nabstract essence of any substance; but was the abstracted name of a\nmode, and its concrete humanus, not homo.\nCHAPTER IX.\nOF THE IMPERFECTION OF WORDS.\n1. Words are used for recording and communicating our Thoughts.\nFrom what has been said in the foregoing chapters, it is easy to\nperceive what imperfection there is in language, and how the very nature\nof words makes it almost unavoidable for many of them to be doubtful\nand uncertain in their significations. To examine the perfection or\nimperfection of words, it is necessary first to consider their use and\nend: for as they are more or less fitted to attain that, so they are\nmore or less perfect. We have, in the former part of this discourse\noften, upon occasion, mentioned a double use of words.\nFirst, One for the recording of our own thoughts.\nSecondly, The other for the communicating of our thoughts to others.\n2. Any Words will serve for recording.\nAs to the first of these, FOR THE RECORDING OUR OWN THOUGHTS FOR THE\nHELP OF OUR OWN MEMORIES, whereby, as it were, we talk to ourselves,\nany words will serve the turn. For since sounds are voluntary and\nindifferent signs of any ideas, a man may use what words he pleases to\nsignify his own ideas to himself: and there will be no imperfection in\nthem, if he constantly use the same sign for the same idea: for then he\ncannot fail of having his meaning understood, wherein consists the right\nuse and perfection of language.\n3. Communication by Words either for civil or philosophical purposes.\nSecondly, As to COMMUNICATION BY WORDS, that too has a double use.\nI. Civil.\nII. Philosophical. First, By, their CIVIL use, I mean such a\ncommunication of thoughts and ideas by words, as may serve for the\nupholding common conversation and commerce, about the ordinary affairs\nand conveniences of civil life, in the societies of men, one amongst\nanother.\nSecondly, By the PHILOSOPHICAL use of words, I mean such a use of them\nas may serve to convey the precise notions of things, and to express in\ngeneral propositions certain and undoubted truths, which the mind may\nrest upon and be satisfied with in its search after true knowledge.\nThese two uses are very distinct; and a great deal less exactness will\nserve in the one than in the other, as we shall see in what follows.\n4. The imperfection of Words is the Doubtfulness or ambiguity of their\nSignification, which is caused by the sort of ideas they stand for.\nThe chief end of language in communication being to be understood,\nwords serve not well for that end, neither in civil nor philosophical\ndiscourse, when any word does not excite in the hearer the same idea\nwhich it stands for in the mind of the speaker. Now, since sounds have\nno natural connexion with our ideas, but have all their signification\nfrom the arbitrary imposition of men, the doubtfulness and uncertainty\nof their signification, which is the imperfection we here are speaking\nof, has its cause more in the ideas they stand for than in any\nincapacity there is in one sound more than in another to signify any\nidea: for in that regard they are all equally perfect.\nThat then which makes doubtfulness and uncertainty in the signification\nof some more than other words, is the difference of ideas they stand\nfor.\n5. Natural Causes of their Imperfection, especially in those that stand\nfor Mixed Modes, and for our ideas of Substances.\nWords having naturally no signification, the idea which each stands for\nmust be learned and retained, by those who would exchange thoughts, and\nhold intelligible discourse with others, in any language. But this is\nthe hardest to be done where,\nFirst, The ideas they stand for are very complex, and made up of a great\nnumber of ideas put together.\nSecondly, Where the ideas they stand for have no certain connexion in\nnature; and so no settled standard anywhere in nature existing, to\nrectify and adjust them by.\nThirdly, When the signification of the word is referred to a standard,\nwhich standard is not easy to be known.\nFourthly, Where the signification of the word and the real essence of\nthe thing are not exactly the same.\nThese are difficulties that attend the signification of several words\nthat are intelligible. Those which are not intelligible at all, such\nas names standing for any simple ideas which another has not organs or\nfaculties to attain; as the names of colours to a blind man, or sounds\nto a deaf man, need not here be mentioned.\nIn all these cases we shall find an imperfection in words; which I shall\nmore at large explain, in their particular application to our several\nsorts of ideas: for if we examine them, we shall find that the NAMES OF\n_M_IXED _M_ODES ARE MOST LIABLE TO DOUBTFULNESS AND IMPERFECTION, FOR\nTHE TWO FIRST OF THESE REASONS; and the NAMES OF _S_UBSTANCES CHIEFLY\nFOR THE TWO LATTER.\n6. The Names of mixed Modes doubtful.\nFirst, The names of MIXED MODES are, many of them, liable to great\nuncertainty and obscurity in their signification.\nI. Because the Ideas they stand for are so complex.\nBecause of that GREAT COMPOSITION these complex ideas are often made\nup of. To make words serviceable to the end of communication, it is\nnecessary, as has been said, that they excite in the hearer exactly the\nsame idea they stand for in the mind of the speaker. Without this, men\nfill one another's heads with noise and sounds; but convey not thereby\ntheir thoughts, and lay not before one another their ideas, which is the\nend of discourse and language. But when a word stands for a very complex\nidea that is compounded and decompounded, it is not easy for men to form\nand retain that idea so exactly, as to make the name in common use stand\nfor the same precise idea, without any the least variation. Hence it\ncomes to pass that men's names of very compound ideas, such as for the\nmost part are moral words, have seldom in two different men the same\nprecise signification; since one man's complex idea seldom agrees with\nanother's, and often differs from his own--from that which he had\nyesterday, or will have tomorrow.\n7. Secondly because they have no Standards in Nature.\nBecause the names of mixed modes for the most part WANT STANDARDS\nIN NATURE, whereby men may rectify and adjust their significations;\ntherefore they are very various and doubtful. They are assemblages of\nideas put together at the pleasure of the mind, pursuing its own ends of\ndiscourse, and suited to its own notions; whereby it designs not to copy\nanything really existing, but to denominate and rank things as they\ncome to agree with those archetypes or forms it has made. He that first\nbrought the word SHAM, or WHEEDLE, or BANTER, in use, put together as he\nthought fit those ideas he made it stand for; and as it is with any new\nnames of modes that are now brought into any language, so it was with\nthe old ones when they were first made use of. Names, therefore, that\nstand for collections of ideas which the mind makes at pleasure must\nneeds be of doubtful signification, when such collections are nowhere\nto be found constantly united in nature, nor any patterns to be shown\nwhereby men may adjust them. What the word MURDER, or SACRILEGE, &c.,\nsignifies can never be known from things themselves: there be many of\nthe parts of those complex ideas which are not visible in the action\nitself; the intention of the mind, or the relation of holy things, which\nmake a part of murder or sacrilege, have no necessary connexion with the\noutward and visible action of him that commits either: and the pulling\nthe trigger of the gun with which the murder is committed, and is all\nthe action that perhaps is visible, has no natural connexion with those\nother ideas that make up the complex one named murder. They have their\nunion and combination only from the understanding which unites them\nunder one name: but, uniting them without any rule or pattern, it cannot\nbe but that the signification of the name that stands for such voluntary\ncollections should be often various in the minds of different men, who\nhave scarce any standing rule to regulate themselves and their notions\nby, in such arbitrary ideas.\n8. Common use, or propriety not a sufficient Remedy.\nIt is true, common use, that is, the rule of propriety may be supposed\nhere to afford some aid, to settle the signification of language; and it\ncannot be denied but that in some measure it does. Common use regulates\nthe meaning of words pretty well for common conversation; but nobody\nhaving an authority to establish the precise signification of words,\nnor determine to what ideas any one shall annex them, common use is\nnot sufficient to adjust them to Philosophical Discourses; there being\nscarce any name of any very complex idea (to say nothing of others)\nwhich, in common use, has not a great latitude, and which, keeping\nwithin the bounds of propriety, may not be made the sign of far\ndifferent ideas. Besides, the rule and measure of propriety itself being\nnowhere established, it is often matter of dispute, whether this or that\nway of using a word be propriety of speech or no. From all which it is\nevident, that the names of such kind of very complex ideas are\nnaturally liable to this imperfection, to be of doubtful and uncertain\nsignification; and even in men that have a mind to understand one\nanother, do not always stand for the same idea in speaker and hearer.\nThough the names GLORY and GRATITUDE be the same in every man's mouth\nthrough a whole country, yet the complex collective idea which every one\nthinks on or intends by that name, is apparently very different in men\nusing the same language.\n9. The way of learning these Names contributes also to their\nDoubtfulness.\nThe way also wherein the names of mixed modes are ordinarily learned,\ndoes not a little contribute to the doubtfulness of their signification.\nFor if we will observe how children learn languages, we shall find that,\nto make them understand what the names of simple ideas or substances\nstand for, people ordinarily show them the thing whereof they would have\nthem have the idea; and then repeat to them the name that stands for\nit; as WHITE, SWEET, MILK, SUGAR, CAT, DOG. But as for mixed modes,\nespecially the most material of them, MORAL WORDS, the sounds are\nusually learned first; and then, to know what complex ideas they stand\nfor, they are either beholden to the explication of others, or (which\nhappens for the most part) are left to their own observation and\nindustry; which being little laid out in the search of the true and\nprecise meaning of names, these moral words are in most men's mouths\nlittle more than bare sounds; or when they have any, it is for the most\npart but a very loose and undetermined, and, consequently, obscure and\nconfused signification. And even those themselves who have with more\nattention settled their notions, do yet hardly avoid the inconvenience\nto have them stand for complex ideas different from those which other,\neven intelligent and studious men, make them the signs of. Where shall\none find any, either controversial debate, or familiar discourse,\nconcerning honour, faith, grace, religion, church, &c., wherein it is\nnot easy to observe the different notions men have of them? Which is\nnothing but this, that they are not agreed in the signification of those\nwords, nor have in their minds the same complex ideas which they make\nthem stand for, and so all the contests that follow thereupon are\nonly about the meaning of a sound. And hence we see that, in the\ninterpretation of laws, whether divine or human, there is no end;\ncomments beget comments, and explications make new matter for\nexplications; and of limiting, distinguishing, varying the signification\nof these moral words there is no end. These ideas of men's making are,\nby men still having the same power, multiplied in infinitum. Many a man\nwho was pretty well satisfied of the meaning of a text of Scripture, or\nclause in the code, at first reading, has, by consulting commentators,\nquite lost the sense of it, and by these elucidations given rise or\nincrease to his doubts, and drawn obscurity upon the place. I say not\nthis that I think commentaries needless; but to show how uncertain the\nnames of mixed modes naturally are, even in the mouths of those who had\nboth the intention and the faculty of speaking as clearly as language\nwas capable to express their thoughts.\n10. Hence unavoidable Obscurity in ancient Authors.\nWhat obscurity this has unavoidably brought upon the writings of men who\nhave lived in remote ages, and different countries, it will be needless\nto take notice. Since the numerous volumes of learned men, employing\ntheir thoughts that way, are proofs more than enough, to show what\nattention, study, sagacity, and reasoning are required to find out the\ntrue meaning of ancient authors. But, there being no writings we have\nany great concernment to be very solicitous about the meaning of, but\nthose that contain either truths we are required to believe, or laws\nwe are to obey, and draw inconveniences on us when we mistake or\ntransgress, we may be less anxious about the sense of other authors;\nwho, writing but their own opinions, we are under no greater necessity\nto know them, than they to know ours. Our good or evil depending not on\ntheir decrees, we may safely be ignorant of their notions: and therefore\nin the reading of them, if they do not use their words with a due\nclearness and perspicuity, we may lay them aside, and without any injury\ndone them, resolve thus with ourselves,\nSi non vis intelligi, debes negligi.\n11. Names of Substances of doubtful Signification, because the ideas\nthey stand for relate to the reality of things.\nIf the signification of the names of mixed modes be uncertain, because\nthere be no real standards existing in nature to which those ideas are\nreferred, and by which they may be adjusted, the names of SUBSTANCES are\nof a doubtful signification, for a contrary reason, viz. because the\nideas they stand for are supposed conformable to the reality of things,\nand are referred to as standards made by Nature. In our ideas of\nsubstances we have not the liberty, as in mixed modes, to frame what\ncombinations we think fit, to be the characteristical notes to rank and\ndenominate things by. In these we must follow Nature, suit our complex\nideas to real existences, and regulate the signification of their names\nby the things themselves, if we will have our names to be signs of them,\nand stand for them. Here, it is true, we have patterns to follow; but\npatterns that will make the signification of their names very uncertain:\nfor names must be of a very unsteady and various meaning, if the ideas\nthey stand for be referred to standards without us, that either cannot\nbe known at all, or can be known but imperfectly and uncertainly.\n12. Names of Substances referred, I. To real Essences that cannot be\nknown.\nThe names of substances have, as has been shown, a double reference in\ntheir ordinary use.\nFirst, Sometimes they are made to stand for, and so their signification\nis supposed to agree to, THE REAL CONSTITUTION OF THINGS, from which\nall their properties flow, and in which they all centre. But this real\nconstitution, or (as it is apt to be called) essence, being utterly\nunknown to us, any sound that is put to stand for it must be very\nuncertain in its application; and it will be impossible to know what\nthings are or ought to be called a HORSE, or ANTIMONY, when those words\nare put for real essences that we have no ideas of at all. And therefore\nin this supposition, the names of substances being referred to standards\nthat cannot be known, their significations can never be adjusted and\nestablished by those standards.\n13. Secondly, To co-existing Qualities, which are known but imperfectly.\nSecondly, The simple ideas that are FOUND TO CO-EXIST IN SUBSTANCES\nbeing that which their names immediately signify, these, as united in\nthe several sorts of things, are the proper standards to which their\nnames are referred, and by which their significations may be best\nrectified. But neither will these archetypes so well serve to this\npurpose as to leave these names without very various and uncertain\nsignifications. Because these simple ideas that co-exist, and are united\nin the same subject, being very numerous, and having all an equal right\nto go into the complex specific idea which the specific name is to stand\nfor, men, though they propose to themselves the very same subject to\nconsider, yet frame very different ideas about it; and so the name they\nuse for it unavoidably comes to have, in several men, very different\nsignifications. The simple qualities which make up the complex ideas,\nbeing most of them powers, in relation to changes which they are apt\nto make in, or receive from other bodies, are almost infinite. He that\nshall but observe what a great variety of alterations any one of the\nbaser metals is apt to receive, from the different application only of\nfire; and how much a greater number of changes any of them will receive\nin the hands of a chymist, by the application of other bodies, will not\nthink it strange that I count the properties of any sort of bodies not\neasy to be collected, and completely known, by the ways of inquiry which\nour faculties are capable of. They being therefore at least so many,\nthat no man can know the precise and definite number, they are\ndifferently discovered by different men, according to their various\nskill, attention, and ways of handling; who therefore cannot choose\nbut have different ideas of the same substance, and therefore make the\nsignification of its common name very various and uncertain. For the\ncomplex ideas of substances, being made up of such simple ones as are\nsupposed to co-exist in nature, every one has a right to put into his\ncomplex idea those qualities he has found to be united together. For,\nthough in the substance of gold one satisfies himself with colour and\nweight, yet another thinks solubility in aqua regia as necessary to\nbe joined with that colour in his idea of gold, as any one does its\nfusibility; solubility in aqua regia being a quality as constantly\njoined with its colour and weight as fusibility or any other; others\nput into it ductility or fixedness, &c., as they have been taught by\ntradition or experience. Who of all these has established the right\nsignification of the word, gold? Or who shall be the judge to determine?\nEach has his standard in nature, which he appeals to, and with reason\nthinks he has the same right to put into his complex idea signified by\nthe word gold, those qualities, which, upon trial, he has found united;\nas another who has not so well examined has to leave them out; or a\nthird, who has made other trials, has to put in others. For the union in\nnature of these qualities being the true ground of their union in one\ncomplex idea, who can say one of them has more reason to be put in or\nleft out than another? From hence it will unavoidably follow, that the\ncomplex ideas of substances in men using the same names for them,\nwill be very various, and so the significations of those names very\nuncertain.\n14. Thirdly, To co-existing Qualities which are known but imperfectly.\nBesides, there is scarce any particular thing existing, which, in some\nof its simple ideas, does not communicate with a greater, and in others\na less number of particular beings: who shall determine in this case\nwhich are those that are to make up the precise collection that is to\nbe signified by the specific name? or can with any just authority\nprescribe, which obvious or common qualities are to be left out;\nor which more secret, or more particular, are to be put into the\nsignification of the name of any substance? All which together, seldom\nor never fail to produce that various and doubtful signification in\nthe names of substances, which causes such uncertainty, disputes, or\nmistakes, when we come to a philosophical use of them.\n15. With this imperfection, they may serve for civil, but not well for\nphilosophical Use.\nIt is true, as to civil and common conversation, the general names of\nsubstances, regulated in their ordinary signification by some obvious\nqualities, (as by the shape and figure in things of known seminal\npropagation, and in other substances, for the most part by colour,\njoined with some other sensible qualities,) do well enough to design the\nthings men would be understood to speak of: and so they usually\nconceive well enough the substances meant by the word gold or apple, to\ndistinguish the one from the other. But in PHILOSOPHICAL inquiries and\ndebates, where general truths are to be established, and consequences\ndrawn from positions laid down, there the precise signification of the\nnames of substances will be found not only not to be well established\nbut also very hard to be so. For example: he that shall make\nmalleability, or a certain degree of fixedness, a part of his complex\nidea of gold, may make propositions concerning gold, and draw\nconsequences from them, that will truly and clearly follow from gold,\ntaken in such a signification: but yet such as another man can never\nbe forced to admit, nor be convinced of their truth, who makes not\nmalleableness, or the same degree of fixedness, part of that complex\nidea that the name gold, in his use of it, stands for.\n16. Instance, Liquor.\nThis is a natural and almost unavoidable imperfection in almost all the\nnames of substances, in all languages whatsoever, which men will easily\nfind when, once passing from confused or loose notions, they come to\nmore strict and close inquiries. For then they will be convinced how\ndoubtful and obscure those words are in their signification, which in\nordinary use appeared very clear and determined. I was once in a meeting\nof very learned and ingenious physicians, where by chance there arose a\nquestion, whether any liquor passed through the filaments of the nerves.\nThe debate having been managed a good while, by variety of arguments on\nboth sides, I (who had been used to suspect, that the greatest part\nof disputes were more about the signification of words than a real\ndifference in the conception of things) desired, that, before they went\nany further on in this dispute, they would first examine and establish\namongst them, what the word LIQUOR signified. They at first were a\nlittle surprised at the proposal; and had they been persons less\ningenious, they might perhaps have taken it for a very frivolous or\nextravagant one: since there was no one there that thought not himself\nto understand very perfectly what the word liquor stood for; which I\nthink, too, none of the most perplexed names of substances. However,\nthey were pleased to comply with my motion; and upon examination found\nthat the signification of that word was not so settled or certain\nas they had all imagined; but that each of them made it a sign of a\ndifferent complex idea. This made them perceive that the main of their\ndispute was about the signification of that term; and that they differed\nvery little in their opinions concerning SOME fluid and subtle matter,\npassing through the conduits of the nerves; though it was not so easy\nto agree whether it was to be called LIQUOR or no, a thing, which, when\nconsidered, they thought it not worth the contending about.\n17. Instance, Gold.\nHow much this is the case in the greatest part of disputes that men are\nengaged so hotly in, I shall perhaps have an occasion in another place\nto take notice. Let us only here consider a little more exactly the\nfore-mentioned instance of the word GOLD, and we shall see how hard it\nis precisely to determine its signification. I think all agree to make\nit stand for a body of a certain yellow shining colour; which being the\nidea to which children have annexed that name, the shining yellow part\nof a peacock's tail is properly to them gold. Others finding fusibility\njoined with that yellow colour in certain parcels of matter, make of\nthat combination a complex idea to which they give the name gold, to\ndenote a sort of substances; and so exclude from being gold all such\nyellow shining bodies as by fire will be reduced to ashes; and admit to\nbe of that species, or to be comprehended under that name gold, only\nsuch substances as having that shining yellow colour, will by fire be\nreduced to fusion, and not to ashes. Another, by the same reason, adds\nthe weight, which, being a quality as straightly joined with that colour\nas its fusibility, he thinks has the same reason to be joined in its\nidea, and to be signified by its name: and therefore the other made up\nof body, of such a colour and fusibility, to be imperfect; and so on\nof all the rest: wherein no one can show a reason why some of the\ninseparable qualities, that are always united in nature, should be put\ninto the nominal essence, and others left out, or why the word gold,\nsignifying that sort of body the ring on his finger is made of, should\ndetermine that sort rather by its colour, weight, and fusibility,\nthan by its colour, weight, and solubility in aqua regia: since the\ndissolving it by that liquor is as inseparable from it as the fusion\nby fire, and they are both of them nothing but the relation which\nthat substance has to two other bodies, which have a power to operate\ndifferently upon it. For by what right is it that fusibility comes to be\na part of the essence signified by the word gold, and solubility but\na property of it? Or why is its colour part of the essence, and its\nmalleableness but a property? That which I mean is this, That these\nbeing all but properties, depending on its real constitution, and\nnothing but powers, either active or passive, in reference to other\nbodies, no one has authority to determine the signification of the\nword gold (as referred to such a body existing in nature) more to one\ncollection of ideas to be found in that body than to another: whereby\nthe signification of that name must unavoidably be very uncertain.\nSince, as has been said, several people observe several properties in\nthe same substance; and I think I may say nobody all. And therefore we\nhave but very imperfect descriptions of things, and words have very\nuncertain significations.\n18. The Names of simple Ideas the least doubtful.\nFrom what has been said, it is easy to observe what has been before\nremarked, viz. that the NAMES OF SIMPLE IDEAS are, of all others, the\nleast liable to mistakes, and that for these reasons. First, Because the\nideas they stand for, being each but one single perception, are much\neasier got, and more clearly retained, than the more complex ones, and\ntherefore are not liable to the uncertainty which usually attends those\ncompounded ones of substances and mixed modes, in which the precise\nnumber of simple ideas that make them up are not easily agreed, so\nreadily kept in mind. And, Secondly, Because they are never referred to\nany other essence, but barely that perception they immediately signify:\nwhich reference is that which renders the signification of the names\nof substances naturally so perplexed, and gives occasion to so many\ndisputes. Men that do not perversely use their words, or on purpose set\nthemselves to cavil, seldom mistake, in any language which they are\nacquainted with, the use and signification of the name of simple ideas.\nWHITE and SWEET, YELLOW and BITTER, carry a very obvious meaning with\nthem, which every one precisely comprehends, or easily perceives he is\nignorant of, and seeks to be informed. But what precise collection of\nsimple ideas MODESTY or FRUGALITY stand for, in another's use, is not\nso certainly known. And however we are apt to think we well enough know\nwhat is meant by GOLD or IRON; yet the precise complex idea others make\nthem the signs of is not so certain: and I believe it is very seldom\nthat, in speaker and hearer, they stand for exactly the same collection.\nWhich must needs produce mistakes and disputes, when they are made use\nof in discourses, wherein men have to do with universal propositions,\nand would settle in their minds universal truths, and consider the\nconsequences that follow from them.\n19. And next to them, simple Modes.\nBy the same rule, the names of SIMPLE MODES are, next to those of simple\nideas, least liable to doubt and uncertainty; especially those of figure\nand number, of which men have so clear and distinct ideas. Who ever that\nhad a mind to understand them mistook the ordinary meaning of SEVEN, or\na TRIANGLE? And in general the least compounded ideas in every kind have\nthe least dubious names.\n20. The most doubtful are the Names of very compounded mixed Modes and\nSubstances.\nMixed modes, therefore, that are made up but of a few and obvious simple\nideas, have usually names of no very uncertain signification. But the\nnames of mixed modes, which comprehend a great number of simple ideas,\nare commonly of a very doubtful and undetermined meaning, as has been\nshown. The names of substances, being annexed to ideas that are neither\nthe real essences, nor exact representations of the patterns they are\nreferred to, are liable to yet greater imperfection and uncertainty,\nespecially when we come to a philosophical use of them.\n21. Why this Imperfection charged upon Words.\nThe great disorder that happens in our names of substances, proceeding,\nfor the most part, from our want of knowledge, and inability to\npenetrate into their real constitutions, it may probably be wondered\nwhy I charge this as an imperfection rather upon our words than\nunderstandings. This exception has so much appearance of justice, that I\nthink myself obliged to give a reason why I have followed this method.\nI must confess, then, that, when I first began this Discourse of the\nUnderstanding, and a good while after, I had not the least thought that\nany consideration of words was at all necessary to it. But when, having\npassed over the original and composition of our ideas, I began to\nexamine the extent and certainty of our knowledge, I found it had so\nnear a connexion with words, that, unless their force and manner of\nsignification were first well observed, there could be very little said\nclearly and pertinently concerning knowledge: which being conversant\nabout truth, had constantly to do with propositions. And though it\nterminated in things, yet it was for the most part so much by the\nintervention of words, that they seemed scarce separable from our\ngeneral knowledge. At least they interpose themselves so much between\nour understandings, and the truth which it would contemplate and\napprehend, that, like the medium through which visible objects pass, the\nobscurity and disorder do not seldom cast a mist before our eyes, and\nimpose upon our understandings. If we consider, in the fallacies men put\nupon themselves, as well as others, and the mistakes in men's disputes\nand notions, how great a part is owing to words, and their uncertain or\nmistaken significations, we shall have reason to think this no small\nobstacle in the way to knowledge; which I conclude we are the more\ncarefully to be warned of, because it has been so far from being taken\nnotice of as an inconvenience, that the arts of improving it have\nbeen made the business of men's study, and obtained the reputation of\nlearning and subtilty, as we shall see in the following chapter. But\nI am apt to imagine, that, were the imperfections of language, as the\ninstrument of knowledge, more thoroughly weighed, a great many of the\ncontroversies that make such a noise in the world, would of themselves\ncease; and the way to knowledge, and perhaps peace too, lie a great deal\nopener than it does.\n22. This should teach us Moderation in imposing our own Sense of old\nAuthors.\nSure I am that the signification of words in all languages, depending\nvery much on the thoughts, notions, and ideas of him that uses them,\nmust unavoidably be of great uncertainty to men of the same language and\ncountry. This is so evident in the Greek authors, that he that shall\nperuse their writings will find in almost every one of them, a distinct\nlanguage, though the same words. But when to this natural difficulty in\nevery country, there shall be added different countries and remote ages,\nwherein the speakers and writers had very different notions, tempers,\ncustoms, ornaments, and figures of speech, &c., every one of which\ninfluenced the signification of their words then, though to us now they\nare lost and unknown; it would become us to be charitable one to another\nin our interpretations or misunderstandings of those ancient writings;\nwhich, though of great concernment to be understood, are liable to the\nunavoidable difficulties of speech, which (if we except the names of\nsimple ideas, and some very obvious things) is not capable, without a\nconstant defining the terms, of conveying the sense and intention of the\nspeaker, without any manner of doubt and uncertainty to the hearer. And\nin discourses of religion, law, and morality, as they are matters of the\nhighest concernment, so there will be the greatest difficulty.\n23. Especially of the Old and New Testament Scriptures.\nThe volumes of interpreters and commentators on the Old and New\nTestament are but too manifest proofs of this. Though everything said in\nthe text be infallibly true, yet the reader may be, nay, cannot choose\nbut be, very fallible in the understanding of it. Nor is it to be\nwondered, that the will of God, when clothed in words, should be liable\nto that doubt and uncertainty which unavoidably attends that sort of\nconveyance, when even his Son, whilst clothed in flesh, was subject to\nall the frailties and inconveniences of human nature, sin excepted. And\nwe ought to magnify his goodness, that he hath spread before all the\nworld such legible characters of his works and providence, and given all\nmankind so sufficient a light of reason, that they to whom this written\nword never came, could not (whenever they set themselves to search)\neither doubt of the being of a God, or of the obedience due to him.\nSince then the precepts of Natural Religion are plain, and very\nintelligible to all mankind, and seldom come to be controverted; and\nother revealed truths, which are conveyed to us by books and languages,\nare liable to the common and natural obscurities and difficulties\nincident to words; methinks it would become us to be more careful and\ndiligent in observing the former, and less magisterial, positive, and\nimperious, in imposing our own sense and interpretations of the latter.\nCHAPTER X.\nOF THE ABUSE OF WORDS.\n1. Woeful abuse of Words.\nBesides the imperfection that is naturally in language, and the\nobscurity and confusion that is so hard to be avoided in the use of\nwords, there are several WILFUL faults and neglects which men are guilty\nof in this way of communication, whereby they render these signs less\nclear and distinct in their signification than naturally they need to\nbe.\n2. First, Words are often employed without any, or without clear Ideas.\nFIRST, In this kind the first and most palpable abuse is, the using\nof words without clear and distinct ideas; or, which is worse, signs\nwithout anything signified. Of these there are two sorts:--\nI. Some words introduced without clear ideas annexed to them, even in\ntheir first original.\nOne may observe, in all languages, certain words that, if they be\nexamined, will be found in their first original, and their appropriated\nuse, not to stand for any clear and distinct ideas. These, for the most\npart, the several sects of philosophy and religion have introduced. For\ntheir authors or promoters, either affecting something singular, and out\nof the way of common apprehensions, or to support some strange opinions,\nor cover some weakness of their hypothesis, seldom fail to coin new\nwords, and such as, when they come to be examined, may justly be called\nINSIGNIFICANT TERMS. For, having either had no determinate collection of\nideas annexed to them when they were first invented; or at least such\nas, if well examined, will be found inconsistent, it is no wonder, if,\nafterwards, in the vulgar use of the same party, they remain empty\nsounds, with little or no signification, amongst those who think it\nenough to have them often in their mouths, as the distinguishing\ncharacters of their Church or School, without much troubling their heads\nto examine what are the precise ideas they stand for. I shall not need\nhere to heap up instances; every man's reading and conversation will\nsufficiently furnish him. Or if he wants to be better stored, the\ngreat mint-masters of this kind of terms, I mean the Schoolmen and\nMetaphysicians (under which I think the disputing natural and moral\nphilosophers of these latter ages may be comprehended) have wherewithal\nabundantly to content him.\n3. II. Other Words, to which ideas were annexed at first, used\nafterwards without distinct meanings.\nOthers there be who extend this abuse yet further, who take so little\ncare to lay by words, which, in their primary notation have scarce\nany clear and distinct ideas which they are annexed to, that, by an\nunpardonable negligence, they familiarly use words which the propriety\nof language HAS affixed to very important ideas, without any distinct\nmeaning at all. WISDOM, GLORY, GRACE, &c., are words frequent enough in\nevery man's mouth; but if a great many of those who use them should be\nasked what they mean by them, they would be at a stand, and not know\nwhat to answer: a plain proof, that, though they have learned those\nsounds, and have them ready at their tongues ends, yet there are no\ndetermined ideas laid up in their minds, which are to be expressed to\nothers by them.\n4. This occasioned by men learning Names before they have the Ideas the\nnames belong to.\nMen having been accustomed from their cradles to learn words which are\neasily got and retained, before they knew or had framed the complex\nideas to which they were annexed, or which were to be found in the\nthings they were thought to stand for, they usually continue to do so\nall their lives; and without taking the pains necessary to settle in\ntheir minds determined ideas, they use their words for such unsteady and\nconfused notions as they have, contenting themselves with the same words\nother people use; as if their very sound necessarily carried with it\nconstantly the same meaning. This, though men make a shift with in\nthe ordinary occurrences of life, where they find it necessary to be\nunderstood, and therefore they make signs till they are so; yet this\ninsignificancy in their words, when they come to reason concerning\neither their tenets or interest, manifestly fills their discourse with\nabundance of empty unintelligible noise and jargon, especially in moral\nmatters, where the words for the most part standing for arbitrary and\nnumerous collections of ideas, not regularly and permanently united in\nnature, their bare sounds are often only thought on, or at least very\nobscure and uncertain notions annexed to them. Men take the words\nthey find in use amongst their neighbours; and that they may not seem\nignorant what they stand for, use them confidently, without much\ntroubling their heads about a certain fixed meaning; whereby, besides\nthe ease of it, they obtain this advantage, That, as in such discourses\nthey seldom are in the right, so they are as seldom to be convinced that\nthey are in the wrong; it being all one to go about to draw those men\nout of their mistakes who have no settled notions, as to dispossess a\nvagrant of his habitation who has no settled abode. This I guess to be\nso; and every one may observe in himself and others whether it be so or\nnot.\n5. Secondly Unsteady Application of them.\nSECONDLY, Another great abuse of words is INCONSTANCY in the use of\nthem. It is hard to find a discourse written on any subject, especially\nof controversy, wherein one shall not observe, if he read with\nattention, the same words (and those commonly the most material in the\ndiscourse, and upon which the argument turns) used sometimes for one\ncollection of simple ideas, and sometimes for another; which is a\nperfect abuse of language. Words being intended for signs of my ideas,\nto make them known to others, not by any natural signification, but by\na voluntary imposition, it is plain cheat and abuse, when I make them\nstand sometimes for one thing and sometimes for another; the wilful\ndoing whereof can be imputed to nothing but great folly, or greater\ndishonesty. And a man, in his accounts with another may, with as much\nfairness make the characters of numbers stand sometimes for one and\nsometimes for another collection of units: v.g. this character 3, stand\nsometimes for three, sometimes for four, and sometimes for eight, as\nin his discourse or reasoning make the same words stand for different\ncollections of simple ideas. If men should do so in their reckonings, I\nwonder who would have to do with them? One who would speak thus in the\naffairs and business of the world, and call 8 sometimes seven, and\nsometimes nine, as best served his advantage, would presently have\nclapped upon him, one of the two names men are commonly disgusted with.\nAnd yet in arguings and learned contests, the same sort of proceedings\npasses commonly for wit and learning; but to me it appears a greater\ndishonesty than the misplacing of counters in the casting up a debt; and\nthe cheat the greater, by how much truth is of greater concernment and\nvalue than money.\n6. Thirdly, Affected Obscurity, as in the Peripatetic and other sects of\nPhilosophy.\nTHIRDLY. Another abuse of language is an AFFECTED OBSCURITY; by either\napplying old words to new and unusual significations; or introducing new\nand ambiguous terms, without defining either; or else putting them\nso together, as may confound their ordinary meaning. Though the\nPeripatetick philosophy has been most eminent in this way, yet other\nsects have not been wholly clear of it. There are scarce any of them\nthat are not cumbered with some difficulties (such is the imperfection\nof human knowledge,) which they have been fain to cover with obscurity\nof terms, and to confound the signification of words, which, like a\nmist before people's eyes, might hinder their weak parts from being\ndiscovered. That BODY and EXTENSION in common use, stand for two\ndistinct ideas, is plain to any one that will but reflect a little. For\nwere their signification precisely the same, it would be as proper, and\nas intelligible to say, 'the body of an extension,' as the 'extension of\na body;' and yet there are those who find it necessary to confound their\nsignification. To this abuse, and the mischiefs of confounding the\nsignification of words, logic, and the liberal sciences as they have\nbeen handled in the schools, have given reputation; and the admired Art\nof Disputing hath added much to the natural imperfection of languages,\nwhilst it has been made use of and fitted to perplex the signification\nof words, more than to discover the knowledge and truth of things: and\nhe that will look into that sort of learned writings, will find the\nwords there much more obscure, uncertain, and undetermined in their\nmeaning, than they are in ordinary conversation.\n7. Logic and Dispute have much contributed to this.\nThis is unavoidably to be so, where men's parts and learning are\nestimated by their skill in disputing. And if reputation and reward\nshall attend these conquests, which depend mostly on the fineness and\nniceties of words, it is no wonder if the wit of man so employed, should\nperplex, involve, and subtilize the signification of sounds, so as never\nto want something to say in opposing or defending any question; the\nvictory being adjudged not to him who had truth on his side, but the\nlast word in the dispute.\n8. Calling it Subtlety.\nThis, though a very useless skill, and that which I think the direct\nopposite to the ways of knowledge, hath yet passed hitherto under the\nlaudable and esteemed names of SUBTLETY and ACUTENESS, and has had the\napplause of the schools, and encouragement of one part of the learned\nmen of the world. And no wonder, since the philosophers of old, (the\ndisputing and wrangling philosophers I mean, such as Lucian wittily and\nwith reason taxes,) and the Schoolmen since, aiming at glory and esteem,\nfor their great and universal knowledge, easier a great deal to be\npretended to than really acquired, found this a good expedient to cover\ntheir ignorance, with a curious and inexplicable web of perplexed words,\nand procure to themselves the admiration of others, by unintelligible\nterms, the apter to produce wonder because they could not be understood;\nwhilst it appears in all history, that these profound doctors were no\nwiser nor more useful than their neighbours, and brought but small\nadvantage to human life or the societies wherein they lived; unless the\ncoining of new words, where they produced no new things to apply them\nto, or the perplexing or obscuring the signification of old ones, and so\nbringing all things into question and dispute, were a thing profitable\nto the life of man, or worthy commendation and reward.\n9. This Learning very little benefits Society.\nFor, notwithstanding these learned disputants, these all-knowing\ndoctors, it was to the unscholastic statesman that the governments\nof the world owed their peace, defence, and liberties; and from the\nilliterate and contemned mechanic (a name of disgrace) that they\nreceived the improvements of useful arts. Nevertheless, this artificial\nignorance, and learned gibberish, prevailed mightily in these last ages,\nby the interest and artifice of those who found no easier way to that\npitch of authority and dominion they have attained, than by amusing\nthe men of business, and ignorant, with hard words, or employing the\ningenious and idle in intricate disputes about unintelligible terms, and\nholding them perpetually entangled in that endless labyrinth. Besides,\nthere is no such way to gain admittance, or give defence to strange and\nabsurd doctrines, as to guard them round about with legions of obscure,\ndoubtful, and undefined words. Which yet make these retreats more like\nthe dens of robbers, or holes of foxes, than the fortresses of fair\nwarriors; which, if it be hard to get them out of, it is not for the\nstrength that is in them, but the briars and thorns, and the obscurity\nof the thickets they are beset with. For untruth being unacceptable\nto the mind of man, there is no other defence left for absurdity but\nobscurity.\n10. But destroys the instruments of Knowledge and communication.\nThus learned ignorance, and this art of keeping even inquisitive men\nfrom true knowledge, hath been propagated in the world, and hath much\nperplexed, whilst it pretended to inform the understanding. For we see\nthat other well-meaning and wise men, whose education and parts had not\nacquired that ACUTENESS, could intelligibly express themselves to one\nanother; and in its plain use make a benefit of language. But though\nunlearned men well enough understood the words white and black; &c., and\nhad constant notions of the ideas signified by those words; yet there\nwere philosophers found who had learning and subtlety enough to prove\nthat snow was black; i.e. to prove that white was black. Whereby they\nhad the advantage to destroy the instruments and means of discourse,\nconversation, instruction, and society; whilst, with great art and\nsubtlety, they did no more but perplex and confound the signification of\nwords, and thereby render language less useful than the real defects of\nit had made it; a gift which the illiterate had not attained to.\n11. As useful as to confound the sound that the Letters of the Alphabet\nstand for.\nThese learned men did equally instruct men's understandings, and\nprofit their lives, as he who should alter the signification of known\ncharacters, and, by a subtle device of learning, far surpassing the\ncapacity of the illiterate, dull, and vulgar, should in his writing show\nthat he could put A for B, and D for E, &c., to the no small admiration\nand benefit of for his reader. It being as senseless to put BLACK,\nwhich is a word agreed on to stand for one sensible idea, to put it, I\nsay, for another, or the contrary idea; i.e. to call SNOW BLACK, as\nto put this mark A, which is a character agreed on to stand for one\nmodification of sound, made by a certain motion of the organs of speech,\nfor B, which is agreed on to stand for another modification of sound,\nmade by another certain mode of the organs of speech.\n12. This Art has perplexed Religion and Justice.\nNor hath this mischief stopped in logical niceties, or curious empty\nspeculations; it hath invaded the great concernments of human life and\nsociety; obscured and perplexed the material truths of law and divinity;\nbrought confusion, disorder, and uncertainty into the affairs of\nmankind; and if not destroyed, yet in a great measure rendered useless,\nthese two great rules, religion and justice. What have the greatest part\nof the comments and disputes upon the laws of God and man served for,\nbut to make the meaning more doubtful, and perplex the sense? What have\nbeen the effect of those multiplied curious distinctions, and acute\nniceties, but obscurity and uncertainty, leaving the words more\nunintelligible, and the reader more at a loss? How else comes it to pass\nthat princes, speaking or writing to their servants, in their ordinary\ncommands are easily understood; speaking to their people, in their laws,\nare not so? And, as I remarked before, doth it not often happen that a\nman of an ordinary capacity very well understands a text, or a law, that\nhe reads, till he consults an expositor, or goes to counsel; who, by\nthat time he hath done explaining them, makes the words signify either\nnothing at all, or what he pleases.\n13. and ought not to pass for Learning.\nWhether any by-interests of these professions have occasioned this, I\nwill not here examine; but I leave it to be considered, whether it would\nnot be well for mankind, whose concernment it is to know things as they\nare, and to do what they ought, and not to spend their lives in talking\nabout them, or tossing words to and fro;--whether it would not be well,\nI say, that the use of words were made plain and direct; and that\nlanguage, which was given us for the improvement of knowledge and bond\nof society, should not be employed to darken truth and unsettle people's\nrights; to raise mists, and render unintelligible both morality and\nreligion? Or that at least, if this will happen, it should not be\nthought learning or knowledge to do so?\n14. IV. Fourthly, by taking Words for Things.\nFOURTHLY, Another great abuse of words is, the TAKING THEM FOR THINGS.\nThis, though it in some degree concerns all names in general, yet more\nparticularly affects those of substances. To this abuse those men are\nmost subject who most confine their thoughts to any one system, and\ngive themselves up into a firm belief of the perfection of any received\nhypothesis: whereby they come to be persuaded that the terms of that\nsect are so suited to the nature of things, that they perfectly\ncorrespond with their real existence. Who is there that has been bred up\nin the Peripatetick philosophy, who does not think the Ten Names, under\nwhich are ranked the Ten Predicaments, to be exactly conformable to the\nnature of things? Who is there of that school that is not persuaded that\nSUBSTANTIAL FORMS, VEGETATIVE SOULS, ABHORRENCE OF A VACUUM, INTENTIONAL\nSPECIES, &c., are something real? These words men have learned from\ntheir very entrance upon knowledge, and have found their masters and\nsystems lay great stress upon them: and therefore they cannot quit\nthe opinion, that they are conformable to nature, and are the\nrepresentations of something that really exists. The Platonists have\ntheir SOUL OF THE WORLD, and the Epicureans their ENDEAVOR TOWARDS\nMOTION in their atoms when at rest. There is scarce any sect in\nphilosophy has not a distinct set of terms that others understand not.\nBut yet this gibberish, which, in the weakness of human understanding,\nserves so well to palliate men's ignorance, and cover their errors,\ncomes, by familiar use amongst those of the same tribe, to seem the\nmost important part of language, and of all other the terms the most\nsignificant: and should AERIAL and OETHERIAL VEHICLES come once, by the\nprevalency of that doctrine, to be generally received anywhere, no doubt\nthose terms would make impressions on men's minds, so as to establish\nthem in the persuasion of the reality of such things, as much as\nPeripatetick FORMS and INTENTIONAL SPECIES have heretofore done. 15.\nInstance, in Matter.\nHow much names taken for things are apt to mislead the understanding,\nthe attentive reading of philosophical writers would abundantly\ndiscover; and that perhaps in words little suspected of any such misuse.\nI shall instance in one only, and that a very familiar one. How many\nintricate disputes have there been about MATTER, as if there were some\nsuch thing really in nature, distinct from BODY; as it is evident the\nword matter stands for an idea distinct from the idea of body? For if\nthe ideas these two terms stood for were precisely the same, they might\nindifferently in all places be put for one another. But we see that\nthough it be proper to say, There is one matter of all bodies, one\ncannot say, There is one body of all matters: we familiarly say one body\nis bigger than another; but it sounds harsh (and I think is never used)\nto say one matter is bigger than another. Whence comes this, then? Viz.\nfrom hence: that, though matter and body be not really distinct, but\nwherever there is the one there is the other; yet matter and body stand\nfor two different conceptions, whereof the one is incomplete, and but\na part of the other. For body stands for a solid extended figured\nsubstance, whereof matter is but a partial and more confused conception;\nit seeming to me to be used for the substance and solidity of body,\nwithout taking in its extension and figure: and therefore it is that,\nspeaking of matter, we speak of it always as one, because in truth it\nexpressly contains nothing but the idea of a solid substance, which is\neverywhere the same, everywhere uniform. This being our idea of matter,\nwe no more conceive or speak of different MATTERS in the world than\nwe do of different solidities; though we both conceive and speak of\ndifferent bodies, because extension and figure are capable of variation.\nBut, since solidity cannot exist without extension and figure, the\ntaking matter to be the name of something really existing under that\nprecision, has no doubt produced those obscure and unintelligible\ndiscourses and disputes, which have filled the heads and books of\nphilosophers concerning materia prima; which imperfection or abuse,\nhow far it may concern a great many other general terms I leave to be\nconsidered. This, I think, I may at least say, that we should have a\ngreat many fewer disputes in the world, if words were taken for what\nthey are, the signs of our ideas only; and not for things themselves.\nFor, when we argue about MATTER, or any the like term, we truly argue\nonly about the idea we express by that sound, whether that precise idea\nagree to anything really existing in nature or no. And if men would tell\nwhat ideas they make their words stand for, there could not be half that\nobscurity or wrangling in the search or support of truth that there is.\n16. This makes Errors lasting.\nBut whatever inconvenience follows from this mistake of words, this I am\nsure, that, by constant and familiar use, they charm men into notions\nfar remote from the truth of things. It would be a hard matter to\npersuade any one that the words which his father, or schoolmaster, the\nparson of the parish, or such a reverend doctor used, signified nothing\nthat really existed in nature: which perhaps is none of the least causes\nthat men are so hardly drawn to quit their mistakes, even in opinions\npurely philosophical, and where they have no other interest but truth.\nFor the words they have a long time been used to, remaining firm in\ntheir minds, it is no wonder that the wrong notions annexed to them\nshould not be removed.\n17. Fifthly, by setting them in the place of what they cannot signify.\nV. FIFTHLY, Another abuse of words is, THE SETTING THEM IN THE PLACE OF\nTHINGS WHICH THEY DO OR CAN BY NO MEANS SIGNIFY. We may observe that, in\nthe general names of substances, whereof the NOMINAL essences are only\nknown to us, when we put them into propositions, and affirm or deny\nanything about them, we do most commonly tacitly suppose or intend, they\nshould stand for the REAL essence of a certain sort of substances.\nFor, when a man says gold is malleable, he means and would insinuate\nsomething more than this, That what I call gold is malleable, (though\ntruly it amounts to no more,) but would have this understood, viz.\nThat gold, i.e. what has the real essence of gold, is malleable; which\namounts to thus much, that malleableness depends on, and is inseparable\nfrom the real essence of gold. But a man, not knowing wherein that real\nessence consists, the connexion in his mind of malleableness is not\ntruly with an essence he knows not, but only with the sound gold he puts\nfor it. Thus, when we say that ANIMAL RATIONALE is, and animal imflume\nbipes latis unguibus is not a good definition of a man; it is plain we\nsuppose the name man in this case to stand for the real essence of a\nspecies, and would signify that 'a rational animal' better described\nthat real essence than 'a two-legged animal with broad nails, and\nwithout feathers.' For else, why might not Plato as properly make the\nword [word in Greek], or MAN, stand for his complex idea, made up of the\nidea of a body, distinguished from others by a certain shape and other\noutward appearances, as Aristotle make the complex idea to which he gave\nthe name [word in Greek], or MAN, of body and the faculty of reasoning\njoined together; unless the name [word in Greek], or MAN, were supposed\nto stand for something else than what it signifies; and to be put in the\nplace of some other thing than the idea a man professes he would express\nby it?\n18. VI. Putting them for the real Essences of Substances.\nIt is true the names of substances would be much more useful, and\npropositions made in them much more certain, were the real essences of\nsubstances the ideas in our minds which those words signified. And it\nis for want of those real essences that our words convey so little\nknowledge or certainty in our discourses about them; and therefore the\nmind, to remove that imperfection as much as it can, makes them, by a\nsecret supposition, to stand for a thing having that real essence, as if\nthereby it made some nearer approaches to it. For, though the word MAN\nor GOLD signify nothing truly but a complex idea of properties united\ntogether in one sort of substances; yet there is scarce anybody, in the\nuse of these words, but often supposes each of those names to stand for\na thing having the real essence on which these properties depend. Which\nis so far from diminishing the imperfection of our words, that by a\nplain abuse it adds to it, when we would make them stand for something,\nwhich, not being in our complex idea, the name we use can no ways be the\nsign of.\n19. Hence we think Change of our Complex Ideas of Substances not to\nchange their Species.\nThis shows us the reason why in MIXED MODES any of the ideas that make\nthe composition of the complex one being left out or changed, it is\nallowed to be another thing, i.e. to be of another species, as is plain\nin CHANCE-MEDLEY, MANSLAUGHTER, MURDER, PARRICIDE, &c. The reason\nwhereof is, because the complex idea signified by that name is the real\nas well as nominal essence; and there is no secret reference of that\nname to any other essence but that. But in SUBSTANCES, it is not so. For\nthough in that called GOLD, one puts into his complex idea what another\nleaves out, and vice versa: yet men do not usually think that therefore\nthe species is changed: because they secretly in their minds refer that\nname, and suppose it annexed to a real immutable essence of a thing\nexisting, on which those properties depend. He that adds to his complex\nidea of gold that of fixedness and solubility in AQUA REGIA, which he\nput not in it before, is not thought to have changed the species; but\nonly to have a more perfect idea, by adding another simple idea, which\nis always in fact joined with those other, of which his former complex\nidea consisted. But this reference of the name to a thing, whereof we\nhave not the idea, is so far from helping at all, that it only serves\nthe more to involve us in difficulties. For by this tacit reference to\nthe real essence of that species of bodies, the word GOLD (which, by\nstanding for a more or less perfect collection of simple ideas, serves\nto design that sort of body well enough in civil discourse) comes to\nhave no signification at all, being put for somewhat whereof we have no\nidea at all, and so can signify nothing at all, when the body itself is\naway. For however it may be thought all one, yet, if well considered, it\nwill be found a quite different thing, to argue about gold in name, and\nabout a parcel in the body itself, v.g. a piece of leaf-gold laid before\nus; though in discourse we are fain to substitute the name for the\nthing.\n20. The Cause of this Abuse, a supposition of Nature's working always\nregularly, in setting boundaries to Species.\nThat which I think very much disposes men to substitute their names for\nthe real essences of species, is the supposition before mentioned,\nthat nature works regularly in the production of things, and sets the\nboundaries to each of those species, by giving exactly the same real\ninternal constitution to each individual which we rank under one general\nname. Whereas any one who observes their different qualities can hardly\ndoubt, that many of the individuals, called by the same name, are, in\ntheir internal constitution, as different one from another as several of\nthose which are ranked under different specific names. This supposition,\nhowever, that the same precise and internal constitution goes always\nwith the same specific name, makes men forward to take those names for\nthe representatives of those real essences; though indeed they signify\nnothing but the complex ideas they have in their minds when they use\nthem. So that, if I may so say, signifying one thing, and being supposed\nfor, or put in the place of another, they cannot but, in such a kind of\nuse, cause a great deal of uncertainty in men's discourses; especially\nin those who have thoroughly imbibed the doctrine of SUBSTANTIAL\nFORMS, whereby they firmly imagine the several species of things to be\ndetermined and distinguished.\n21. This Abuse contains two false Suppositions.\nBut however preposterous and absurd it be to make our names stand for\nideas we have not, or (which is all one) essences that we know not,\nit being in effect to make our words the signs of nothing; yet it is\nevident to any one who ever so little reflects on the use men make\nof their words, that there is nothing more familiar. When a man asks\nwhether this or that thing he sees, let it be a drill, or a monstrous\nfoetus, be a MAN or no; it is evident the question is not, Whether that\nparticular thing agree to his complex idea expressed by the name man:\nbut whether it has in it the real essence of a species of things which\nhe supposes his name man to stand for. In which way of using the names\nof substances, there are these false suppositions contained:--\nFirst, that there are certain precise essences according to which nature\nmakes all particular things, and by which they are distinguished into\nspecies. That everything has a real constitution, whereby it is what it\nis, and on which its sensible qualities depend, is past doubt: but I\nthink it has been proved that this makes not the distinction of species\nas WE rank them, nor the boundaries of their names.\nSecondly, this tacitly also insinuates, as if we had IDEAS of these\nproposed essences. For to what purpose else is it, to inquire whether\nthis or that thing have the real essence of the species man, if we did\nnot suppose that there were such a specifick essence known? Which yet\nis utterly false. And therefore such application of names as would make\nthem stand for ideas which we have not, must needs cause great disorder\nin discourses and reasonings about them, and be a great inconvenience in\nour communication by words.\n22. VI. Sixthly, by proceeding upon the supposition that the words we\nuse have a certain and evident Signification which other men cannot but\nunderstand.\nSIXTHLY, there remains yet another more general, though perhaps less\nobserved, abuse of words; and that is, that men having by a long and\nfamiliar use annexed to them certain ideas, they are apt to imagine SO\nNEAR AND NECESSARY A CONNEXION BETWEEN THE NAMES AND SIGNIFICATION THEY\nUSE THEM IN, that they forwardly suppose one cannot but understand what\ntheir meaning is; and therefore one ought to acquiesce in the words\ndelivered, as if it were past doubt that, in the use of those common\nreceived sounds, the speaker and hearer had necessarily the same precise\nideas. Whence presuming, that when they have in discourse used any term,\nthey have thereby, as it were, set before others the very thing they\ntalked of. And so likewise taking the words of others, as naturally\nstanding for just what they themselves have been accustomed to apply\nthem to, they never trouble themselves to explain their own, or\nunderstand clearly others' meaning. From whence commonly proceeds noise,\nand wrangling, without improvement or information; whilst men take words\nto be the constant regular marks of agreed notions, which in truth are\nno more but the voluntary and unsteady signs of their own ideas. And yet\nmen think it strange, if in discourse, or (where it is often absolutely\nnecessary) in dispute, one sometimes asks the meaning of their terms:\nthough the arguings one may every day observe in conversation make it\nevident, that there are few names of complex ideas which any two men use\nfor the same just precise collection. It is hard to name a word which\nwill not be a clear instance of this. LIFE is a term, none more\nfamiliar. Any one almost would take it for an affront to be asked what\nhe meant by it. And yet if it comes in question, whether a plant that\nlies ready formed in the seed have life; whether the embryo in an egg\nbefore incubation, or a man in a swoon without sense or motion, be alive\nor no; it is easy to perceive that a clear, distinct, settled idea does\nnot always accompany the use of so known a word as that of life is. Some\ngross and confused conceptions men indeed ordinarily have, to which they\napply the common words of their language; and such a loose use of their\nwords serves them well enough in their ordinary discourses or affairs.\nBut this is not sufficient for philosophical inquiries. Knowledge and\nreasoning require precise determinate ideas. And though men will not\nbe so importunately dull as not to understand what others say, without\ndemanding an explication of their terms; nor so troublesomely critical\nas to correct others in the use of the words they receive from them:\nyet, where truth and knowledge are concerned in the case, I know not\nwhat fault it can be, to desire the explication of words whose sense\nseems dubious; or why a man should be ashamed to own his ignorance in\nwhat sense another man uses his words; since he has no other way of\ncertainly knowing it but by being informed. This abuse of taking words\nupon trust has nowhere spread so far, nor with so ill effects, as\namongst men of letters. The multiplication and obstinacy of disputes,\nwhich have so laid waste the intellectual world, is owing to nothing\nmore than to this ill use of words. For though it be generally believed\nthat there is great diversity of opinions in the volumes and variety of\ncontroversies the world is distracted with; yet the most I can find that\nthe contending learned men of different parties do, in their arguings\none with another, is, that they speak different languages. For I am apt\nto imagine, that when any of them, quitting terms, think upon things,\nand know what they think, they think all the same: though perhaps what\nthey would have be different.\n23. The Ends of Language: First, To convey our Ideas.\nTo conclude this consideration of the imperfection and abuse of\nlanguage. The ends of language in our discourse with others being\nchiefly these three: First, to make known one man's thoughts or ideas to\nanother; Secondly, to do so with as much ease and quickness as possible;\nand, Thirdly, thereby to convey the knowledge of things: language is\neither abused or deficient, when it fails of any of these three.\nFirst, Words fail in the first of these ends, and lay not open one man's\nideas to another's view: 1. When men have names in their mouths without\nany determinate ideas in their minds whereof they are the signs: or, 2.\nWhen they apply the common received names of any language to ideas, to\nwhich the common use of that language does not apply them: or 3. When\nthey apply them very unsteadily, making them stand now for one, and by\nand by for another idea.\n24. Secondly, To do it with Quickness.\nSecondly, Men fail of conveying their thoughts with the quickness and\nease that may be, when they have complex ideas without having any\ndistinct names for them. This is sometimes the fault of the language\nitself, which has not in it a sound yet applied to such a signification;\nand sometimes the fault of the man, who has not yet learned the name for\nthat idea he would show another.\n25. Thirdly, Therewith to convey the Knowledge of Things.\nThirdly, there is no knowledge of things conveyed by men's words, when\ntheir ideas agree not to the reality of things. Though it be a defect\nthat has its original in our ideas, which are not so conformable to the\nnature of things as attention, study and application might make them,\nyet it fails not to extend itself to our words too, when we use them as\nsigns of real beings, which yet never had any reality or existence.\n26. How Men's Words fail in all these: First, when used without any\nideas.\nFirst, He that hath words of any language, without distinct ideas in\nhis mind to which he applies them, does, so far as he uses them in\ndiscourse, only make a noise without any sense or signification; and how\nlearned soever he may seem, by the use of hard words or learned terms,\nis not much more advanced thereby in knowledge, than he would be in\nlearning, who had nothing in his study but the bare titles of books,\nwithout possessing the contents of them. For all such words, however\nput into discourse, according to the right construction of grammatical\nrules, or the harmony of well-turned periods, do yet amount to nothing\nbut bare sounds, and nothing else.\n27. Secondly, when complex ideas are without names annexed to them.\nSecondly, He that has complex ideas, without particular names for them,\nwould be in no better case than a bookseller, who had in his warehouse\nvolumes that lay there unbound, and without titles, which he could\ntherefore make known to others only by showing the loose sheets, and\ncommunicate them only by tale. This man is hindered in his discourse,\nfor want of words to communicate his complex ideas, which he is\ntherefore forced to make known by an enumeration of the simple ones that\ncompose them; and so is fain often to use twenty words, to express what\nanother man signifies in one.\n28. Thirdly, when the same sign is not put for the same idea.\nThirdly, He that puts not constantly the same sign for the same idea,\nbut uses the same word sometimes in one and sometimes in another\nsignification, ought to pass in the schools and conversation for as fair\na man, as he does in the market and exchange, who sells several things\nunder the same name.\n29. Fourthly, when words are diverted from their common use.\nFourthly, He that applies the words of any language to ideas different\nfrom those to which the common use of that country applies them, however\nhis own understanding may be filled with truth and light, will not by\nsuch words be able to convey much of it to others, without defining his\nterms. For however the sounds are such as are familiarly known, and\neasily enter the ears of those who are accustomed to them; yet standing\nfor other ideas than those they usually are annexed to, and are wont to\nexcite in the mind of the hearers, they cannot make known the thoughts\nof him who thus uses them.\n30. Fifthly, when they are names of fantastical imaginations.\nFifthly, He that imagined to himself substances such as never have been,\nand filled his head with ideas which have not any correspondence with\nthe real nature of things, to which yet he gives settled and defined\nnames, may fill his discourse, and perhaps another man's head, with the\nfantastical imaginations of his own brain, but will be very far from\nadvancing thereby one jot in real and true knowledge.\n31. Summary.\nHe that hath names without ideas, wants meaning in his words, and speaks\nonly empty sounds. He that hath complex ideas without names for them,\nwants liberty and dispatch in his expressions, and is necessitated to\nuse periphrases. He that uses his words loosely and unsteadily will\neither be not minded or not understood. He that applies his names to\nideas different from their common use, wants propriety in his language,\nand speaks gibberish. And he that hath the ideas of substances\ndisagreeing with the real existence of things, so far wants the\nmaterials of true knowledge in his understanding, and hath instead\nthereof chimeras.\n32. How men's words fail when they stand for Substances.\nIn our notions concerning Substances, we are liable to all the former\ninconveniences: v. g. he that uses the word TARANTULA, without having\nany imagination or idea of what it stands for, pronounces a good\nword; but so long means nothing at all by it. 2. He that, in a\nnewly-discovered country, shall see several sorts of animals and\nvegetables, unknown to him before, may have as true ideas of them, as of\na horse or a stag; but can speak of them only by a description, till he\nshall either take the names the natives call them by, or give them names\nhimself. 3. He that uses the word BODY sometimes for pure extension,\nand sometimes for extension and solidity together, will talk very\nfallaciously. 4. He that gives the name HORSE to that idea which common\nusage calls MULE, talks improperly, and will not be understood. 5. He\nthat thinks the name CENTAUR stands for some real being, imposes on\nhimself, and mistakes words for things.\n33. How when they stand for Modes and Relations.\nIn Modes and Relations generally, we are liable only to the four first\nof these inconveniences; viz. 1. I may have in my memory the names of\nmodes, as GRATITUDE or CHARITY, and yet not have any precise ideas\nannexed in my thoughts to those names, 2. I may have ideas, and not know\nthe names that belong to them: v. g. I may have the idea of a man's\ndrinking till his colour and humour be altered, till his tongue trips,\nand his eyes look red, and his feet fail him; and yet not know that\nit is to be called DRUNKENNESS. 3. I may have the ideas of virtues or\nvices, and names also, but apply them amiss: v. g. when I apply the name\nFRUGALITY to that idea which others call and signify by this sound,\nCOVETOUSNESS. 4. I may use any of those names with inconstancy. 5. But,\nin modes and relations, I cannot have ideas disagreeing to the existence\nof things: for modes being complex ideas, made by the mind at pleasure,\nand relation being but by way of considering or comparing two things\ntogether, and so also an idea of my own making, these ideas can scarce\nbe found to disagree with anything existing; since they are not in the\nmind as the copies of things regularly made by nature, nor as properties\ninseparably flowing from the internal constitution or essence of any\nsubstance; but, as it were, patterns lodged in my memory, with names\nannexed to them, to denominate actions and relations by, as they come\nto exist. But the mistake is commonly in my giving a wrong name to my\nconceptions; and so using words in a different sense from other people:\nI am not understood, but am thought to have wrong ideas of them, when I\ngive wrong names to them. Only if I put in my ideas of mixed modes or\nrelations any inconsistent ideas together, I fill my head also with\nchimeras; since such ideas, if well examined, cannot so much as exist in\nthe mind, much less any real being ever be denominated from them.\n34. Seventhly, Language is often abused by Figurative Speech.\nSince wit and fancy find easier entertainment in the world than dry\ntruth and real knowledge, figurative speeches and allusion in language\nwill hardly be admitted as an imperfection or abuse of it. I confess, in\ndiscourses where we seek rather pleasure and delight than information\nand improvement, such ornaments as are borrowed from them can scarce\npass for faults. But yet if we would speak of things as they are, we\nmust allow that all the art of rhetoric, besides order and clearness;\nall the artificial and figurative application of words eloquence hath\ninvented, are for nothing else but to insinuate wrong ideas, move the\npassions, and thereby mislead the judgment; and so indeed are perfect\ncheats: and therefore, however laudable or allowable oratory may render\nthem in harangues and popular addresses, they are certainly, in all\ndiscourses that pretend to inform or instruct, wholly to be avoided; and\nwhere truth and knowledge are concerned, cannot but be thought a great\nfault, either of the language or person that makes use of them. What and\nhow various they are, will be superfluous here to take notice; the books\nof rhetoric which abound in the world, will instruct those who want to\nbe informed: only I cannot but observe how little the preservation and\nimprovement of truth and knowledge is the care and concern of mankind;\nsince the arts of fallacy are endowed and preferred. It is evident how\nmuch men love to deceive and be deceived, since rhetoric, that powerful\ninstrument of error and deceit, has its established professors, is\npublicly taught, and has always been had in great reputation: and I\ndoubt not but it will be thought great boldness, if not brutality, in me\nto have said thus much against it. Eloquence, like the fair sex, has too\nprevailing beauties in it to suffer itself ever to be spoken against.\nAnd it is in vain to find fault with those arts of deceiving, wherein\nmen find pleasure to be deceived.\nCHAPTER XI.\nOF THE REMEDIES OF THE FOREGOING IMPERFECTIONS AND ABUSES OF WORDS.\n1. Remedies are worth seeking.\nThe natural and improved imperfections of languages we have seen above\nat large: and speech being the great bond that holds society together,\nand the common conduit, whereby the improvements of knowledge are\nconveyed from one man and one generation to another, it would well\ndeserve our most serious thoughts to consider, what remedies are to be\nfound for the inconveniences above mentioned.\n2. Are not easy to find.\nI am not so vain as to think that any one can pretend to attempt the\nperfect reforming the languages of the world, no not so much as of his\nown country, without rendering himself ridiculous. To require that men\nshould use their words constantly in the same sense, and for none but\ndetermined and uniform ideas, would be to think that all men should have\nthe same notions, and should talk of nothing but what they have clear\nand distinct ideas of: which is not to be expected by any one who hath\nnot vanity enough to imagine he can prevail with men to be very knowing\nor very silent. And he must be very little skilled in the world, who\nthinks that a voluble tongue shall accompany only a good understanding;\nor that men's talking much or little should hold proportion only to\ntheir knowledge.\n3. But yet necessary to those who search after Truth.\nBut though the market and exchange must be left to their own ways of\ntalking, and gossipings not be robbed of their ancient privilege: though\nthe schools, and men of argument would perhaps take it amiss to have\nanything offered, to abate the length or lessen the number of their\ndisputes; yet methinks those who pretend seriously to search after or\nmaintain truth, should think themselves obliged to study how they might\ndeliver themselves without obscurity, doubtfulness, or equivocation, to\nwhich men's words are naturally liable, if care be not taken.\n4. Misuse of Words the great Cause of Errors.\nFor he that shall well consider the errors and obscurity, the mistakes\nand confusion, that are spread in the world by an ill use of words, will\nfind some reason to doubt whether language, as it has been employed, has\ncontributed more to the improvement or hindrance of knowledge amongst\nmankind. How many are there, that, when they would think on things, fix\ntheir thoughts only on words, especially when they would apply their\nminds to moral matters? And who then can wonder if the result of such\ncontemplations and reasonings, about little more than sounds, whilst the\nideas they annex to them are very confused and very unsteady, or perhaps\nnone at all; who can wonder, I say, that such thoughts and reasonings\nend in nothing but obscurity and mistake, without any clear judgment or\nknowledge?\n5. Has made men more conceited and obstinate.\nThis inconvenience, in an ill use of words, men suffer in their own\nprivate meditations: but much more manifest are the disorders which\nfollow from it, in conversation, discourse, and arguings with others.\nFor language being the great conduit, whereby men convey their\ndiscoveries, reasonings, and knowledge, from one to another, he that\nmakes an ill use of it, though he does not corrupt the fountains of\nknowledge, which are in things themselves, yet he does, as much as in\nhim lies, break or stop the pipes whereby it is distributed to the\npublic use and advantage of mankind. He that uses words without any\nclear and steady meaning, what does he but lead himself and others into\nerrors? And he that designedly does it, ought to be looked on as an\nenemy to truth and knowledge. And yet who can wonder that all the\nsciences and parts of knowledge have been so overcharged with obscure\nand equivocal terms, and insignificant and doubtful expressions, capable\nto make the most attentive or quick-sighted very little, or not at\nall, the more knowing or orthodox: since subtlety, in those who make\nprofession to teach or defend truth, hath passed so much for a virtue: a\nvirtue, indeed, which, consisting for the most part in nothing but the\nfallacious and illusory use of obscure or deceitful terms, is only fit\nto make men more conceited in their ignorance, and more obstinate in\ntheir errors.\n6. Addicted to Wrangling about sounds.\nLet us look into the books of controversy of any kind, there we shall\nsee that the effect of obscure, unsteady, or equivocal terms is nothing\nbut noise and wrangling about sounds, without convincing or bettering\na man's understanding. For if the idea be not agreed on, betwixt the\nspeaker and hearer, for which the words stand, the argument is not about\nthings, but names. As often as such a word whose signification is not\nascertained betwixt them, comes in use, their understandings have no\nother object wherein they agree, but barely the sound; the things that\nthey think on at that time, as expressed by that word, being quite\ndifferent.\n7. Instance, Bat and Bird.\nWhether a BAT be a BIRD or no, is not a question, Whether a bat be\nanother thing than indeed it is, or have other qualities than indeed it\nhas; for that would be extremely absurd to doubt of. But the question\nis, (i) Either between those that acknowledged themselves to have but\nimperfect ideas of one or both of this sort of things, for which these\nnames are supposed to stand. And then it is a real inquiry concerning\nthe NATURE of a bird or a bat, to make their yet imperfect ideas of\nit more complete; by examining whether all the simple ideas to which,\ncombined together, they both give name bird, be all to be found in\na bat: but this is a question only of inquirers (not disputers) who\nneither affirm nor deny, but examine: Or, (2) It is a question between\ndisputants; whereof the one affirms, and the other denies that a bat is\na bird. And then the question is barely about the signification of one\nor both these WORDS; in that they not having both the same complex ideas\nto which they give these two names, one holds and the other denies, that\nthese two names may be affirmed one of another. Were they agreed in the\nsignification of these two names, it were impossible they should dispute\nabout them. For they would presently and clearly see (were that adjusted\nbetween them,) whether all the simple ideas of the more general name\nbird were found in the complex idea of a bat or no; and so there could\nbe no doubt whether a bat were a bird or no. And here I desire it may\nbe considered, and carefully examined, whether the greatest part of the\ndisputes in the world are not merely verbal, and about the signification\nof words; and whether, if the terms they are made in were defined, and\nreduced in their signification (as they must be where they signify\nanything) to determined collections of the simple ideas they do or\nshould stand for, those disputes would not end of themselves, and\nimmediately vanish. I leave it then to be considered, what the learning\nof disputation is, and how well they are employed for the advantage of\nthemselves or others, whose business is only the vain ostentation of\nsounds; i. e. those who spend their lives in disputes and controversies.\nWhen I shall see any of those combatants strip all his terms of\nambiguity and obscurity, (which every one may do in the words he uses\nhimself,) I shall think him a champion for knowledge, truth, and peace,\nand not the slave of vain-glory, ambition, or a party.\n8. Remedies.\nTo remedy the defects of speech before mentioned to some degree, and\nto prevent the inconveniences that follow from them, I imagine the\nobservation of these following rules may be of use, till somebody better\nable shall judge it worth his while to think more maturely on this\nmatter, and oblige the world with his thoughts on it.\nFirst Remedy: To use no Word without an Idea annexed to it.\nFirst, A man shall take care to use no word without a signification, no\nname without an idea for which he makes it stand. This rule will\nnot seem altogether needless to any one who shall take the pains to\nrecollect how often he has met with such words as INSTINCT, SYMPATHY,\nand ANTIPATHY, &c., in the discourse of others, so made use of as he\nmight easily conclude that those that used them had no ideas in their\nminds to which they applied them, but spoke them only as sounds, which\nusually served instead of reasons on the like occasions. Not but that\nthese words, and the like, have very proper significations in which they\nmay be used; but there being no natural connexion between any words and\nany ideas, these, and any other, may be learned by rote, and pronounced\nor writ by men who have no ideas in their minds to which they have\nannexed them, and for which they make them stand; which is necessary\nthey should, if men would speak intelligibly even to themselves alone.\n9. Second Remedy: To have distinct, determinate Ideas annexed to Words,\nespecially in mixed Modes.\nSecondly, It is not enough a man uses his words as signs of some ideas:\nthose he annexes them to, if they be simple, must be clear and distinct;\nif complex, must be determinate, i.e. the precise collection of simple\nideas settled in the mind, with that sound annexed to it, as the sign of\nthat precise determined collection, and no other. This is very necessary\nin names of modes, and especially moral words; which, having no settled\nobjects in nature, from whence their ideas are taken, as from their\noriginal, are apt to be very confused. JUSTICE is a word in every man's\nmouth, but most commonly with a very undetermined, loose signification;\nwhich will always be so, unless a man has in his mind a distinct\ncomprehension of the component parts that complex idea consists of and\nif it be decompounded, must be able to resolve it still only till he at\nlast comes to the simple ideas that make it up: and unless this be done,\na man makes an ill use of the word, let it be justice, for example, or\nany other. I do not say, a man needs stand to recollect, and make this\nanalysis at large, every time the word justice comes in his way: but\nthis at least is necessary, that he have so examined the signification\nof that name, and settled the idea of all its parts in his mind, that\nhe can do it when he pleases. If any one who makes his complex idea of\njustice to be, such a treatment of the person or goods of another as is\naccording to law, hath not a clear and distinct idea what LAW is, which\nmakes a part of his complex idea of justice, it is plain his idea of\njustice itself will be confused and imperfect. This exactness will,\nperhaps, be judged very troublesome; and therefore most men will think\nthey may be excused from settling the complex ideas of mixed modes so\nprecisely in their minds. But yet I must say, till this be done, it must\nnot be wondered, that they have a great deal of obscurity and confusion\nin their own minds, and a great deal of wrangling in their discourse\nwith others.\n10. And distinct and conformable ideas in Words that stand for\nSubstances.\nIn the names of substances, for a right use of them, something more is\nrequired than barely DETERMINED IDEAS. In these the names must also be\nCONFORMABLE TO THINGS AS THEY EXIST; but of this I shall have occasion\nto speak more at large by and by. This exactness is absolutely necessary\nin inquiries after philosophical knowledge, and in controversies about\ntruth. And though it would be well, too, if it extended itself to common\nconversation and the ordinary affairs of life; yet I think that is\nscarce to be expected. Vulgar notions suit vulgar discourses: and both,\nthough confused enough, yet serve pretty well the market and the wake.\nMerchants and lovers, cooks and tailors, have words wherewithal to\ndispatch their ordinary affairs: and so, I think, might philosophers\nand disputants too, if they had a mind to understand, and to clearly\nunderstood.\n11. Third Remedy: To apply Words to such ideas as common use has annexed\nthem to.\nThirdly, it is not enough that men have ideas, determined ideas, for\nwhich they make these signs stand; but they must also take care to apply\ntheir words as near as may be to such ideas as common use has annexed\nthem to. For words, especially of languages already framed, being\nno man's private possession, but the common measure of commerce and\ncommunication, it is not for any one at pleasure to change the stamp\nthey are current in, nor alter the ideas they are affixed to; or at\nleast, when there is a necessity to do so, he is bound to give notice\nof it. Men's intentions in speaking are, or at least should be, to be\nunderstood; which cannot be without frequent explanations, demands,\nand other the like incommodious interruptions, where men do not follow\ncommon use. Propriety of speech is that which gives our thoughts\nentrance into other men's minds with the greatest ease and advantage:\nand therefore deserves some part of our care and study, especially in\nthe names of moral words. The proper signification and use of terms\nis best to be learned from those who in their writings and discourses\nappear to have had the clearest notions, and applied to them their terms\nwith the exactest choice and fitness. This way of using a man's words,\naccording to the propriety of the language, though it have not always\nthe good fortune to be understood; yet most commonly leaves the blame\nof it on him who is so unskilful in the language he speaks, as not to\nunderstand it when made use of as it ought to be.\n12. Fourth Remedy: To declare the meaning in which we use them.\nFourthly, But, because common use has not so visibly annexed any\nsignification to words, as to make men know always certainly what they\nprecisely stand for: and because men, in the improvement of their\nknowledge, come to have ideas different from the vulgar and ordinary\nreceived ones, for which they must either make new words, (which men\nseldom venture to do, for fear of being thought guilty of affectation or\nnovelty,) or else must use old ones in a new signification: therefore,\nafter the observation of the foregoing rules, it is sometimes necessary,\nfor the ascertaining the signification of words, to DECLARE THEIR\nMEANING; where either common use has left it uncertain and loose, (as it\nhas in most names of very complex ideas;) or where the term, being very\nmaterial in the discourse, and that upon which it chiefly turns, is\nliable to any doubtfulness or mistake.\n13. And that in three Ways.\nAs the ideas men's words stand for are of different sorts, so the way of\nmaking known the ideas they stand for, when there is occasion, is also\ndifferent. For though DEFINING be thought the proper way to make known\nthe proper signification of words; yet there are some words that will\nnot be defined, as there are others whose precise meaning cannot be made\nknown but by definition: and perhaps a third, which partake somewhat of\nboth the other, as we shall see in the names of simple ideas, modes, and\nsubstances.\n14. In Simple Ideas, either by synonymous terms, or by showing examples.\nI. First, when a man makes use of the name of any simple idea, which\nhe perceives is not understood, or is in danger to be mistaken, he is\nobliged, by the laws of ingenuity and the end of speech, to declare his\nmeaning, and make known what idea he makes it stand for. This, as\nhas been shown, cannot be done by definition: and therefore, when a\nsynonymous word fails to do it, there is but one of these ways left.\nFirst, Sometimes the NAMING the subject wherein that simple idea is\nto be found, will make its name to be understood by those who are\nacquainted with that subject, and know it by that name. So to make a\ncountryman understand what FEUILLEMORTE colour signifies, it may suffice\nto tell him, it is the colour of withered leaves falling in autumn.\nSecondly, but the only sure way of making known the signification of the\nname of any simple idea, is BY PRESENTING TO HIS SENSES THAT SUBJECT\nWHICH MAY PRODUCE IT IN HIS MIND, and make him actually have the idea\nthat word stands for.\n15. In mixed Modes, by Definition.\nII. Secondly, Mixed modes, especially those belonging to morality, being\nmost of them such combinations of ideas as the mind puts together of its\nown choice, and whereof there are not always standing patterns to be\nfound existing, the signification of their names cannot be made known,\nas those of simple ideas, by any showing: but, in recompense thereof,\nmay be perfectly and exactly defined. For they being combinations of\nseveral ideas that the mind of man has arbitrarily put together, without\nreference to any archetypes, men may, if they please, exactly know the\nideas that go to each composition, and so both use these words in a\ncertain and undoubted signification, and perfectly declare, when there\nis occasion, what they stand for. This, if well considered, would lay\ngreat blame on those who make not their discourses about MORAL things\nvery clear and distinct. For since the precise signification of the\nnames of mixed modes, or, which is all one, the real essence of each\nspecies is to be known, they being not of nature's, but man's making, it\nis a great negligence and perverseness to discourse of moral things\nwith uncertainty and obscurity; which is more pardonable in treating of\nnatural substances, where doubtful terms are hardly to be avoided, for a\nquite contrary reason, as we shall see by and by.\n16. Morality capable of Demonstration.\nUpon this ground it is that I am bold to think that morality is capable\nof demonstration, as well as mathematics: since the precise real essence\nof the things moral words stand for may be perfectly known, and so\nthe congruity and incongruity of the things themselves be certainly\ndiscovered; in which consists perfect knowledge. Nor let any one object,\nthat the names of substances are often to be made use of in morality,\nas well as those of modes, from which will arise obscurity. For, as to\nsubstances, when concerned in moral discourses, their divers natures\nare not so much inquired into as supposed: v.g. when we say that man\nis subject to law, we mean nothing by man but a corporeal rational\ncreature: what the real essence or other qualities of that creature are\nin this case is no way considered. And, therefore, whether a child or\nchangeling be a man, in a physical sense, may amongst the naturalists be\nas disputable as it will, it concerns not at all the moral man, as I\nmay call him, which is this immovable, unchangeable idea, a corporeal\nrational being. For, were there a monkey, or any other creature, to be\nfound that had the use of reason to such a degree, as to be able to\nunderstand general signs, and to deduce consequences about general\nideas, he would no doubt be subject to law, and in that sense be a MAN,\nhow much soever he differed in shape from others of that name. The names\nof substances, if they be used in them as they should, can no more\ndisturb moral than they do mathematical discourses; where, if the\nmathematician speaks of a cube or globe of gold, or of any other body,\nhe has his clear, settled idea, which varies not, though it may by\nmistake be applied to a particular body to which it belongs not.\n17. Definitions can make moral Discourse clear.\nThis I have here mentioned, by the by, to show of what consequence it is\nfor men, in their names of mixed modes, and consequently in all their\nmoral discourses, to define their words when there is occasion: since\nthereby moral knowledge may be brought to so great clearness and\ncertainty. And it must be great want of ingenuousness (to say no worse\nof it) to refuse to do it: since a definition is the only way whereby\nthe precise meaning of moral words can be known; and yet a way whereby\ntheir meaning may be known certainly, and without leaving any room for\nany contest about it. And therefore the negligence or perverseness of\nmankind cannot be excused, if their discourses in morality be not much\nmore clear than those in natural philosophy: since they are about ideas\nin the mind, which are none of them false or disproportionate; they\nhaving no external beings for the archetypes which they are referred to\nand must correspond with. It is far easier for men to frame in their\nminds an idea, which shall be the standard to which they will give the\nname justice; with which pattern so made, all actions that agree shall\npass under that denomination, than, having seen Aristides, to frame an\nidea that shall in all things be exactly like him; who is as he is, let\nmen make what idea they please of him. For the one, they need but know\nthe combination of ideas that are put together in their own minds; for\nthe other, they must inquire into the whole nature, and abstruse hidden\nconstitution, and various qualities of a thing existing without them.\n18. And is the only way in which the meaning of mixed Modes can be made\nknown.\nAnother reason that makes the defining of mixed modes so necessary,\nespecially of moral words, is what I mentioned a little before, viz.\nthat it is the only way whereby the signification of the most of them\ncan be known with certainty. For the ideas they stand for, being for\nthe most part such whose component parts nowhere exist together, but\nscattered and mingled with others, it is the mind alone that collects\nthem, and gives them the union of one idea: and it is only by words\nenumerating the several simple ideas which the mind has united, that we\ncan make known to others what their names stand for; the assistance of\nthe senses in this case not helping us, by the proposal of sensible\nobjects, to show the ideas which our names of this kind stand for, as\nit does often in the names of sensible simple ideas, and also to some\ndegree in those of substances.\n19. In Substances, both by showing and by defining.\nIII. Thirdly, for the explaining the signification of the names of\nsubstances, as they stand for the ideas we have of their distinct\nspecies, both the forementioned ways, viz. of showing and defining, are\nrequisite, in many cases, to be made use of. For, there being ordinarily\nin each sort some leading qualities, to which we suppose the other ideas\nwhich make up our complex idea of that species annexed, we forwardly\ngive the specific name to that thing wherein that characteristic mark is\nfound, which we take to be the most distinguishing idea of that species.\nThese leading or characteristical (as I may call them) ideas, in the\nsorts of animals and vegetables, are (as has been before remarked,\nch vi. Section 29 and ch. ix. Section 15) mostly figure; and in inanimate\nbodies, colour; and in some, both together. Now,\n20. Ideas of the leading Qualities of Substances are best got by\nshowing.\nThese leading sensible qualities are those which make the chief\ningredients of our specific ideas, and consequently the most observable\nand invariable part in the definitions of our specific names, as\nattributed to sorts of substances coming under our knowledge. For though\nthe sound MAN, in its own nature, be as apt to signify a complex idea\nmade up of animality and rationality, united in the same subject, as to\nsignify any other combination; yet, used as a mark to stand for a sort\nof creatures we count of our own kind, perhaps the outward shape is as\nnecessary to be taken into our complex idea, signified by the word man,\nas any other we find in it: and therefore, why Plato's ANIMAL IMPLUME\nBIPES LATIS UNGUIBUS should not be a good definition of the name man,\nstanding for that sort of creatures, will not be easy to show: for it\nis the shape, as the leading quality, that seems more to determine that\nspecies, than a faculty of reasoning, which appears not at first, and in\nsome never. And if this be not allowed to be so, I do not know how they\ncan be excused from murder who kill monstrous births, (as we call them,)\nbecause of an unordinary shape, without knowing whether they have a\nrational soul or no; which can be no more discerned in a well-formed\nthan ill-shaped infant, as soon as born. And who is it has informed us\nthat a rational soul can inhabit no tenement, unless it has just such a\nsort of frontispiece; or can join itself to, and inform no sort of body,\nbut one that is just of such an outward structure?\n21. And can hardly be made known otherwise.\nNow these leading qualities are best made known by showing, and can\nhardly be made known otherwise. For the shape of a horse or cassowary\nwill be but rudely and imperfectly imprinted on the mind by words; the\nsight of the animals doth it a thousand times better. And the idea of\nthe particular colour of gold is not to be got by any description of it,\nbut only by the frequent exercise of the eyes about as is evident in\nthose who are used to this metal, who frequently distinguish true from\ncounterfeit, pure from adulterate, by the sight, where others (who have\nas good eyes, but yet by use have not got the precise nice idea of that\npeculiar yellow) shall not perceive any difference. The like may be said\nof those other simple ideas, peculiar in their kind to any substance;\nfor which precise ideas there are no peculiar names. The particular\nringing sound there is in gold, distinct from the sound of other bodies,\nhas no particular name annexed to it, no more than the particular yellow\nthat belongs to that metal.\n22. The Ideas of the Powers of Substances are best known by Definition.\nBut because many of the simple ideas that make up our specific ideas of\nsubstances are powers which lie not obvious to our senses in the things\nas they ordinarily appear; therefore, in the signification of our names\nof substances, some part of the signification will be better made known\nby enumerating those simple ideas, than by showing the substance itself.\nFor, he that to the yellow shining colour of gold, got by sight, shall,\nfrom my enumerating them, have the ideas of great ductility, fusibility,\nfixedness, and solubility, in aqua regia, will have a perfecter idea of\ngold than he can have by seeing a piece of gold, and thereby imprinting\nin his mind only its obvious qualities. But if the formal constitution\nof this shining, heavy, ductile thing, (from whence all these its\nproperties flow,) lay open to our senses, as the formal constitution or\nessence of a triangle does, the signification of the word gold might as\neasily be ascertained as that of triangle.\n23. A Reflection on the Knowledge of corporeal things possessed by\nSpirits separate from bodies.\nHence we may take notice, how much the foundation of all our knowledge\nof corporeal things lies in our senses. For how spirits, separate from\nbodies, (whose knowledge and ideas of these things are certainly much\nmore perfect than ours,) know them, we have no notion, no idea at all.\nThe whole extent of our knowledge or imagination reaches not beyond our\nown ideas limited to our ways of perception. Though yet it be not to be\ndoubted that spirits of a higher rank than those immersed in flesh may\nhave as clear ideas of the radical constitution of substances as we have\nof a triangle, and so perceive how all their properties and operations\nflow from thence: but the manner how they come by that knowledge exceeds\nour conceptions.\n24. Ideas of Substances must also be conformable to Things.\nFourthly, But, though definitions will serve to explain the names of\nsubstances as they stand for our ideas, yet they leave them not without\ngreat imperfection as they stand for things. For our names of substances\nbeing not put barely for our ideas, but being made use of ultimately to\nrepresent things, and so are put in their place, their signification\nmust agree with the truth of things as well as with men's ideas. And\ntherefore, in substances, we are not always to rest in the ordinary\ncomplex idea commonly received as the signification of that word, but\nmust go a little further, and inquire into the nature and properties of\nthe things themselves, and thereby perfect, as much as we can, our ideas\nof their distinct species; or else learn them from such as are used\nto that sort of things, and are experienced in them. For, since it is\nintended their names should stand for such collections of simple ideas\nas do really exist in things themselves, as well as for the complex idea\nin other men's minds, which in their ordinary acceptation they stand\nfor, therefore, to define their names right, natural history is to be\ninquired into, and their properties are, with care and examination, to\nbe found out. For it is not enough, for the avoiding inconveniences in\ndiscourse and arguings about natural bodies and substantial things,\nto have learned, from the propriety of the language, the common, but\nconfused, or very imperfect, idea to which each word is applied, and to\nkeep them to that idea in our use of them; but we must, by acquainting\nourselves with the history of that sort of things, rectify and settle\nour complex idea belonging to each specific name; and in discourse with\nothers, (if we find them mistake us,) we ought to tell what the complex\nidea is that we make such a name stand for. This is the more necessary\nto be done by all those who search after knowledge and philosophical\nverity, in that children, being taught words, whilst they have but\nimperfect notions of things, apply them at random, and without much\nthinking, and seldom frame determined ideas to be signified by them.\nWhich custom (it being easy, and serving well enough for the ordinary\naffairs of life and conversation) they are apt to continue when they are\nmen: and so begin at the wrong end, learning words first and perfectly,\nbut make the notions to which they apply those words afterwards very\novertly. By this means it comes to pass, that men speaking the language\nof their country, i.e. according to grammar rules of that language, do\nyet speak very improperly of things themselves; and, by their arguing\none with another, make but small progress in the discoveries of useful\ntruths, and the knowledge of things, as they are to be found in\nthemselves, and not in our imaginations; and it matters not much for the\nimprovement of our knowledge how they are called.\n25. Not easy to be made so.\nIt were therefore to be wished, That men versed in physical inquiries,\nand acquainted with the several sorts of natural bodies, would set down\nthose simple ideas wherein they observe the individuals of each sort\nconstantly to agree. This would remedy a great deal of that confusion\nwhich comes from several persons applying the same name to a collection\nof a smaller or greater number of sensible qualities, proportionably as\nthey have been more or less acquainted with, or accurate in examining,\nthe qualities of any sort of things which come under one denomination.\nBut a dictionary of this sort, containing, as it were, a natural\nhistory, requires too many hands as well as too much time, cost, pains,\nand sagacity ever to be hoped for; and till that be done, we must\ncontent ourselves with such definitions of the names of substances as\nexplain the sense men use them in. And it would be well, where there is\noccasion, if they would afford us so much. This yet is not usually done;\nbut men talk to one another, and dispute in words, whose meaning is not\nagreed between them, out of a mistake that the significations of common\nwords are certainly established, and the precise ideas they stand for\nperfectly known; and that it is a shame to be ignorant of them. Both\nwhich suppositions are false, no names of complex ideas having so\nsettled determined significations, that they are constantly used for\nthe same precise ideas. Nor is it a shame for a man to have a certain\nknowledge of anything, but by the necessary ways of attaining it; and so\nit is no discredit not to know what precise idea any sound stands for in\nanother man's mind, without he declare it to me by some other way than\nbarely using that sound, there being no other way, without such a\ndeclaration, certainly to know it. Indeed the necessity of communication\nby language brings men to an agreement in the signification of common\nwords, within some tolerable latitude, that may serve for ordinary\nconversation: and so a man cannot be supposed wholly ignorant of the\nideas which are annexed to words by common use, in a language familiar\nto him. But common use being but a very uncertain rule, which reduces\nitself at last to the ideas of particular men, proves often but a\nvery variable standard. But though such a Dictionary as I have above\nmentioned will require too much time, cost, and pains to be hoped for\nin this age; yet methinks it is not unreasonable to propose, that words\nstanding for things which are known and distinguished by their outward\nshapes should be expressed by little draughts and prints made of them. A\nvocabulary made after this fashion would perhaps with more ease, and in\nless time, teach the true signification of many terms, especially in\nlanguages of remote countries or ages, and settle truer ideas in men's\nminds of several things, whereof we read the names in ancient authors,\nthan all the large and laborious comments of learned critics.\nNaturalists, that treat of plants and animals, have found the benefit of\nthis way: and he that has had occasion to consult them will have reason\nto confess that he has a clearer idea of APIUM or IBEX, from a little\nprint of that herb or beast, than he could have from a long definition\nof the names of either of them. And so no doubt he would have of STRIGIL\nand SISTRUM, if, instead of CURRYCOMB and CYMBAL, (which are the English\nnames dictionaries render them by,) he could see stamped in the margin\nsmall pictures of these instruments, as they were in use amongst the\nancients. TOGA, TUNICA, PALLIUM, are words easily translated by GOWN,\nCOAT, and CLOAK; but we have thereby no more true ideas of the fashion\nof those habits amongst the Romans, than we have of the faces of the\ntailors who made them. Such things as these, which the eye distinguishes\nby their shapes, would be best let into the mind by draughts made of\nthem, and more determine the signification of such words, than any other\nwords set for them, or made use of to define them. But this is only by\nthe bye.\n26. V. Fifth Remedy: To use the same word constantly in the same sense.\nFifthly, If men will not be at the pains to declare the meaning of their\nwords, and definitions of their terms are not to be had, yet this is\nthe least that can be expected, that, in all discourses wherein one man\npretends to instruct or convince another, he should use the same word\nconstantly in the same sense. If this were done, (which nobody can\nrefuse without great disingenuity,) many of the books extant might be\nspared; many of the controversies in dispute would be at an end; several\nof those great volumes, swollen with ambiguous words, now used in\none sense, and by and by in another, would shrink into a very narrow\ncompass; and many of the philosophers (to mention no other) as well as\npoets works, might be contained in a nutshell.\n27. When not so used, the Variation is to be explained.\nBut after all, the provision of words is so scanty in respect to that\ninfinite variety of thoughts, that men, wanting terms to suit their\nprecise notions, will, notwithstanding their utmost caution, be forced\noften to use the same word in somewhat different senses. And though in\nthe continuation of a discourse, or the pursuit of an argument, there\ncan be hardly room to digress into a particular definition, as often\nas a man varies the signification of any term; yet the import of the\ndiscourse will, for the most part, if there be no designed fallacy,\nsufficiently lead candid and intelligent readers into the true meaning\nof it; but where there is not sufficient to guide the reader, there it\nconcerns the writer to explain his meaning, and show in what sense he\nthere uses that term.\nBOOK IV\nOF KNOWLEDGE AND PROBABILITY SYNOPSIS OF THE FOURTH BOOK.\nLocke's review of the different sorts of ideas, or appearances of what\nexists, that can be entertained in a human understanding, and of their\nrelations to words, leads, in the Fourth Book, to an investigation of\nthe extent and validity of the Knowledge that our ideas bring within our\nreach; and into the nature of faith in Probability, by which assent is\nextended beyond Knowledge, for the conduct of life. He finds (ch. i, ii)\nthat Knowledge is either an intuitive, a demonstrative, or a sensuous\nperception of absolute certainty, in regard to one or other of four\nsorts of agreement or disagreement on the part of ideas:--(1) of each\nidea with itself, as identical, and different from every other; (2) in\ntheir abstract relations to one another; (3) in their necessary\nconnexions, as qualities and powers coexisting in concrete substances;\nand (4) as revelations to us of the final realities of existence. The\nunconditional certainty that constitutes Knowledge is perceptible by man\nonly in regard to the first, second, and fourth of these four sorts: in\nall general propositions only in regard to the first and second; that is\nto say, in identical propositions, and in those which express abstract\nrelations of simple or mixed modes, in which nominal and real essences\ncoincide, e. g. propositions in pure mathematics and abstract morality\n(chh. iii, v-viii). The fourth sort, which express certainty as to\nrealities of existence, refer to any of three realities. For every man\nis able to perceive with absolute certainty that he himself exists, that\nGod must exist, and that finite beings other than himself exist;--the\nfirst of these perceptions being awakened by all our ideas, the second\nas the consequence of perception of the first, and the last in the\nreception of our simple ideas of sense (chh. i. Section 7; ii. Section\n14; iii. Section 21; iv, ix-xi). Agreement of the third sort, of\nnecessary coexistence of simple ideas as qualities and powers in\nparticular substances, with which all physical inquiry is concerned,\nlies beyond human Knowledge; for here the nominal and real essences are\nnot coincident: general propositions of this sort are determined by\nanalogies of experience, in judgments that are more or less probable:\nintellectually necessary science of nature presupposes Omniscience;\nman's interpretations of nature have to turn upon presumptions of\nProbability (chh. iii. Sections 9-17; iv. SectionS 11-17; vi, xiv-xvi).\nIn forming their stock of Certainties and Probabilities men employ the\nfaculty of reason, faith in divine revelation, and enthusiasm (chh.\nxvii-xix); much misled by the last, as well as by other causes of 'wrong\nassent' (ch. xx), when they are at work in 'the three great provinces of\nthe intellectual world' (ch. xxi), concerned respectively with (1)\n'things as knowable' (physica); (2) 'actions as they depend on us in\norder to happiness' (practica); and (3) methods for interpreting the\nsigns of what is, and of what ought to be, that are presented in our\nideas and words (logica).\nCHAPTER I.\nOF KNOWLEDGE IN GENERAL.\n1. Our Knowledge conversant about our Ideas only.\nSince the mind, in all its thoughts and reasonings, hath no other\nimmediate object but its own ideas, which it alone does or can\ncontemplate, it is evident that our knowledge is only conversant about\nthem.\n2. Knowledge is the Perception of the Agreement or Disagreement of two\nIdeas.\nKNOWLEDGE then seems to me to be nothing but THE PERCEPTION OF THE\nCONNEXION OF AND AGREEMENT, OR DISAGREEMENT AND REPUGNANCY OF ANY OF OUR\nIDEAS. In this alone it consists.\nWhere this perception is, there is knowledge, and where it is not,\nthere, though we may fancy, guess, or believe, yet we always come short\nof knowledge. For when we know that white is not black, what do we\nelse but perceive, that these two ideas do not agree? When we possess\nourselves with the utmost security of the demonstration, that the three\nangles of a triangle are equal to two right ones, what do we more but\nperceive, that equality to two right ones does necessarily agree to, and\nis inseparable from, the three angles of a triangle?\n3. This Agreement or Disagreement may be any of four sorts.\nBut to understand a little more distinctly wherein this agreement or\ndisagreement consists, I think we may reduce it all to these four sorts:\nI. IDENTITY, or DIVERSITY. II. RELATION. III. CO-EXISTENCE, or NECESSARY\nCONNEXION. IV. REAL EXISTENCE.\n4. First, Of Identity, or Diversity in ideas.\nFIRST, As to the first sort of agreement or disagreement, viz. IDENTITY\nor DIVERSITY. It is the first act of the mind, when it has any\nsentiments or ideas at all, to perceive its ideas; and so far as it\nperceives them, to know each what it is, and thereby also to perceive\ntheir difference, and that one is not another. This is so absolutely\nnecessary, that without it there could be no knowledge, no reasoning, no\nimagination, no distinct thoughts at all. By this the mind clearly and\ninfallibly perceives each idea to agree with itself, and to be what it\nis; and all distinct ideas to disagree, i. e. the one not to be the\nother: and this it does without pains, labour, or deduction; but at\nfirst view, by its natural power of perception and distinction. And\nthough men of art have reduced this into those general rules, WHAT IS,\nIS, and IT IS IMPOSSIBLE FOR THE SAME THING TO BE AND NOT TO BE, for\nready application in all cases, wherein there may be occasion to reflect\non it: yet it is certain that the first exercise of this faculty is\nabout particular ideas. A man infallibly knows, as soon as ever he has\nthem in his mind, that the ideas he calls WHITE and ROUND are the very\nideas they are; and that they are not other ideas which he calls RED or\nSQUARE. Nor can any maxim or proposition in the world make him know it\nclearer or surer than he did before, and without any such general\nrule. This then is the first agreement or disagreement which the mind\nperceives in its ideas; which it always perceives at first sight: and\nif there ever happen any doubt about it, it will always be found to\nbe about the names, and not the ideas themselves, whose identity and\ndiversity will always be perceived, as soon and clearly as the ideas\nthemselves are; nor can it possibly be otherwise.\n5. Secondly, Of abstract Relations between ideas.\nSECONDLY, the next sort of agreement or disagreement the mind perceives\nin any of its ideas may, I think, be called RELATIVE, and is nothing\nbut the perception of the RELATION between any two ideas, of what kind\nsoever, whether substances, modes, or any other. For, since all distinct\nideas must eternally be known not to be the same, and so be universally\nand constantly denied one of another, there could be no room for any\npositive knowledge at all, if we could not perceive any relation between\nour ideas, and find out the agreement or disagreement they have one with\nanother, in several ways the mind takes of comparing them.\n6. Thirdly, Of their necessary Co-existence in Substances.\nTHIRDLY, The third sort of agreement or disagreement to be found in\nour ideas, which the perception of the mind is employed about, is\nCO-EXISTENCE or NON-CO-EXISTENCE in the SAME SUBJECT; and this belongs\nparticularly to substances. Thus when we pronounce concerning gold, that\nit is fixed, our knowledge of this truth amounts to no more but this,\nthat fixedness, or a power to remain in the fire unconsumed, is an idea\nthat always accompanies and is joined with that particular sort of\nyellowness, weight, fusibility, malleableness, and solubility in AQUA\nREGIA, which make our complex idea signified by the word gold.\n7. Fourthly, Of real Existence agreeing to any idea.\nFOURTHLY, The fourth and last sort is that of ACTUAL REAL EXISTENCE\nagreeing to any idea.\nWithin these four sorts of agreement or disagreement is, I suppose,\ncontained all the knowledge we have, or are capable of. For all the\ninquiries we can make concerning any of our ideas, all that we know or\ncan affirm concerning any of them, is, That it is, or is not, the same\nwith some other; that it does or does not always co-exist with some\nother idea in the same subject; that it has this or that relation with\nsome other idea; or that it has a real existence without the mind. Thus,\n'blue is not yellow,' is of identity. 'Two triangles upon equal bases\nbetween two parallels are equal,' is of relation. 'Iron is susceptible\nof magnetical impressions,' is of co-existence. 'God is,' is of real\nexistence. Though identity and co-existence are truly nothing but\nrelations, yet they are such peculiar ways of agreement or disagreement\nof our ideas, that they deserve well to be considered as distinct heads,\nand not under relation in general; since they are so different grounds\nof affirmation and negation, as will easily appear to any one, who will\nbut reflect on what is said in several places of this ESSAY.\nI should now proceed to examine the several degrees of our knowledge,\nbut that it is necessary first, to consider the different acceptations\nof the word KNOWLEDGE.\n8. Knowledge is either actual or habitual.\nThere are several ways wherein the mind is possessed of truth; each of\nwhich is called knowledge.\nI. There is ACTUAL KNOWLEDGE, which is the present view the mind has of\nthe agreement or disagreement of any of its ideas, or of the relation\nthey have one to another.\nII. A man is said to know any proposition, which having been once\nlaid before his thoughts, he evidently perceived the agreement or\ndisagreement of the ideas whereof it consists; and so lodged it in his\nmemory, that whenever that proposition comes again to be reflected on,\nhe, without doubt or hesitation, embraces the right side, assents to,\nand is certain of the truth of it. This, I think, one may call HABITUAL\nKNOWLEDGE. And thus a man may be said to know all those truths which are\nlodged in his memory, by a foregoing clear and full perception, whereof\nthe mind is assured past doubt as often as it has occasion to reflect\non them. For our finite understandings being able to think clearly and\ndistinctly but on one thing at once, if men had no knowledge of any more\nthan what they actually thought on, they would all be very ignorant: and\nhe that knew most, would know but one truth, that being all he was able\nto think on at one time.\n9. Habitual Knowledge is of two degrees.\nOf habitual knowledge there are, also, vulgarly speaking, two degrees:\nFirst, The one is of such truths laid up in the memory as, whenever they\noccur to the mind, it ACTUALLY PERCEIVES THE RELATION is between those\nideas. And this is in all those truths whereof we have an intuitive\nknowledge; where the ideas themselves, by an immediate view, discover\ntheir agreement or disagreement one with another.\nSecondly, The other is of such truths whereof the mind having been\nconvinced, it RETAINS THE MEMORY OF THE CONVICTION, WITHOUT THE PROOFS.\nThus, a man that remembers certainly that he once perceived the\ndemonstration, that the three angles of a triangle are equal to two\nright ones, is certain that he knows it, because he cannot doubt the\ntruth of it. In his adherence to a truth, where the demonstration by\nwhich it was at first known is forgot, though a man may be thought\nrather to believe his memory than really to know, and this way of\nentertaining a truth seemed formerly to me like something between\nopinion and knowledge; a sort of assurance which exceeds bare belief,\nfor that relies on the testimony of another;--yet upon a due examination\nI find it comes not short of perfect certainty, and is in effect true\nknowledge. That which is apt to mislead our first thoughts into a\nmistake in this matter is, that the agreement or disagreement of the\nideas in this case is not perceived, as it was at first, by an actual\nview of all the intermediate ideas whereby the agreement or disagreement\nof those in the proposition was at first perceived; but by other\nintermediate ideas, that show the agreement or disagreement of the ideas\ncontained in the proposition whose certainty we remember. For example:\nin this proposition, that 'the three angles of a triangle are equal\nto two right ones,' one who has seen and clearly perceived the\ndemonstration of this truth knows it to be true, when that demonstration\nis gone out of his mind; so that at present it is not actually in view,\nand possibly cannot be recollected: but he knows it in a different way\nfrom what he did before. The agreement of the two ideas joined in that\nproposition is perceived; but it is by the intervention of other ideas\nthan those which at first produced that perception. He remembers, i.e.\nhe knows (for remembrance is but the reviving of some past knowledge)\nthat he was once certain of the truth of this proposition, that the\nthree angles of a triangle are equal to two right ones. The immutability\nof the same relations between the same immutable things is now the idea\nthat shows him, that if the three angles of a triangle were once equal\nto two right ones, they will always be equal to two right ones. And\nhence he comes to be certain, that what was once true in the case, is\nalways true; what ideas once agreed will always agree; and consequently\nwhat he once knew to be true, he will always know to be true; as long\nas he can remember that he once knew it. Upon this ground it is, that\nparticular demonstrations in mathematics afford general knowledge. If\nthen the perception, that the same ideas will ETERNALLY have the same\nhabitudes and relations, be not a sufficient ground of knowledge, there\ncould be no knowledge of general propositions in mathematics; for no\nmathematical demonstration would be any other than particular: and\nwhen a man had demonstrated any proposition concerning one triangle or\ncircle, his knowledge would not reach beyond that particular diagram. If\nhe would extend it further, he must renew his demonstration in another\ninstance, before he could know it to be true in another like triangle,\nand so on: by which means one could never come to the knowledge of\nany general propositions. Nobody, I think, can deny, that Mr. Newton\ncertainly knows any proposition that he now at any time reads in his\nbook to be true; though he has not in actual view that admirable chain\nof intermediate ideas whereby he at first discovered it to be true. Such\na memory as that, able to retain such a train of particulars, may\nbe well thought beyond the reach of human faculties, when the very\ndiscovery, perception, and laying together that wonderful connexion of\nideas, is found to surpass most readers' comprehension. But yet it is\nevident the author himself knows the proposition to be true, remembering\nhe once saw the connexion of those ideas; as certainly as he knows such\na man wounded another, remembering that he saw him run him through. But\nbecause the memory is not always so clear as actual perception, and does\nin all men more or less decay in length of time, this, amongst other\ndifferences, is one which shows that DEMONSTRATIVE knowledge is much\nmore imperfect than INTUITIVE, as we shall see in the following chapter.\nCHAPTER II.\nOF THE DEGREES OF OUR KNOWLEDGE.\n1. Of the degrees, or differences in clearness, of our Knowledge:\nI. Intuitive\nAll our knowledge consisting, as I have said, in the view the mind has\nof its own ideas, which is the utmost light and greatest certainty we,\nwith our faculties, and in our way of knowledge, are capable of, it\nmay not be amiss to consider a little the degrees of its evidence. The\ndifferent clearness of our knowledge seems to me to lie in the different\nway of perception the mind has of the agreement or disagreement of any\nof its ideas. For if we will reflect on our own ways of thinking,\nwe will find, that sometimes the mind perceives the agreement or\ndisagreement of two ideas IMMEDIATELY BY THEMSELVES, without the\nintervention of any other: and this I think we may call INTUITIVE\nKNOWLEDGE. For in this the mind is at no pains of proving or examining,\nbut perceives the truth as the eye doth light, only by being directed\ntowards it. Thus the mind perceives that WHITE is not BLACK, that a\nCIRCLE is not a TRIANGLE, that THREE are more than TWO and equal to ONE\nAND TWO. Such kinds of truths the mind perceives at the first sight of\nthe ideas together, by bare intuition; without the intervention of any\nother idea: and this kind of knowledge is the clearest and most\ncertain that human frailty is capable of. This part of knowledge is\nirresistible, and, like bright sunshine, forces itself immediately to be\nperceived, as soon as ever the mind turns its view that way; and leaves\nno room for hesitation, doubt, or examination, but the mind is presently\nfilled with the clear light of it. IT IS ON THIS INTUITION THAT DEPENDS\nALL THE CERTAINTY AND EVIDENCE OF ALL OUR KNOWLEDGE; which certainty\nevery one finds to be so great, that he cannot imagine, and therefore\nnot require a greater: for a man cannot conceive himself capable of a\ngreater certainty than to know that any idea in his mind is such as\nhe perceives it to be; and that two ideas, wherein he perceives a\ndifference, are different and not precisely the same. He that demands a\ngreater certainty than this, demands he knows not what, and shows\nonly that he has a mind to be a sceptic, without being able to be so.\nCertainty depends so wholly on this intuition, that, in the next degree\nof knowledge which I call demonstrative, this intuition is necessary in\nall the connexions of the intermediate ideas, without which we cannot\nattain knowledge and certainty.\n2. II. Demonstrative.\nThe next degree of knowledge is, where the mind perceives the agreement\nor disagreement of any ideas, but not immediately. Though wherever the\nmind perceives the agreement or disagreement of any of its ideas, there\nbe certain knowledge; yet it does not always happen, that the mind sees\nthat agreement or disagreement, which there is between them, even where\nit is discoverable; and in that case remains in ignorance, and at most\ngets no further than a probable conjecture. The reason why the mind\ncannot always perceive presently the agreement or disagreement of\ntwo ideas, is, because those ideas, concerning whose agreement or\ndisagreement the inquiry is made, cannot by the mind be so put together\nas to show it. In this case then, when the mind cannot so bring its\nideas together as by their immediate comparison, and as it were\njuxta-position or application one to another, to perceive their\nagreement or disagreement, it is fain, BY THE INTERVENTION OF OTHER\nIDEAS, (one or more, as it happens) to discover the agreement or\ndisagreement which it searches; and this is that which we call\nREASONING. Thus, the mind being willing to know the agreement or\ndisagreement in bigness between the three angles of a triangle and\ntwo right ones, cannot by an immediate view and comparing them do it:\nbecause the three angles of a triangle cannot be brought at once, and be\ncompared with any other one, or two, angles; and so of this the mind has\nno immediate, no intuitive knowledge. In this case the mind is fain to\nfind out some other angles, to which the three angles of a triangle have\nan equality; and, finding those equal to two right ones, comes to know\ntheir equality to two right ones.\n3. Demonstration depends on clearly perceived proofs.\nThose intervening ideas, which serve to show the agreement of any two\nothers, are called PROOFS; and where the agreement and disagreement is\nby this means plainly and clearly perceived, it is called DEMONSTRATION;\nit being SHOWN to the understanding, and the mind made to see that it is\nso. A quickness in the mind to find out these intermediate ideas, (that\nshall discover the agreement or disagreement of any other,) and to apply\nthem right, is, I suppose, that which is called SAGACITY.\n4. As certain, but not so easy and ready as Intuitive Knowledge.\nThis knowledge, by intervening proofs, though it be certain, yet the\nevidence of it is not altogether so clear and bright, nor the assent so\nready, as in intuitive knowledge. For, though in demonstration the mind\ndoes at last perceive the agreement or disagreement of the ideas it\nconsiders; yet it is not without pains and attention: there must be more\nthan one transient view to find it. A steady application and pursuit are\nrequired to this discovery: and there must be a progression by steps and\ndegrees, before the mind can in this way arrive at certainty, and come\nto perceive the agreement or repugnancy between two ideas that need\nproofs and the use of reason to show it.\n5. The demonstrated conclusion not without Doubt, precedent to the\ndemonstration.\nAnother difference between intuitive and demonstrative knowledge\nis, that, though in the latter all doubt be removed when, by the\nintervention of the intermediate ideas, the agreement or disagreement\nis perceived, yet before the demonstration there was a doubt; which in\nintuitive knowledge cannot happen to the mind that has its faculty of\nperception left to a degree capable of distinct ideas; no more than it\ncan be a doubt to the eye (that can distinctly see white and black),\nWhether this ink and this paper be all of a colour. If there be sight in\nthe eyes, it will, at first glimpse, without hesitation, perceive the\nwords printed on this paper different from the colour of the paper: and\nso if the mind have the faculty of distinct perception, it will perceive\nthe agreement or disagreement of those ideas that produce intuitive\nknowledge. If the eyes have lost the faculty of seeing, or the mind of\nperceiving, we in vain inquire after the quickness of sight in one, or\nclearness of perception in the other.\n6. Not so clear as Intuitive Knowledge.\nIt is true, the perception produced by demonstration is also very clear;\nyet it is often with a great abatement of that evident lustre and full\nassurance that always accompany that which I call intuitive: like a\nface reflected by several mirrors one to another, where, as long as it\nretains the similitude and agreement with the object, it produces a\nknowledge; but it is still, in every successive reflection, with a\nlessening of that perfect clearness and distinctness which is in the\nfirst; till at last, after many removes, it has a great mixture of\ndimness, and is not at first sight so knowable, especially to weak eyes.\nThus it is with knowledge made out by a long train of proof.\n7. Each Step in Demonstrated Knowledge must have Intuitive Evidence.\nNow, in every step reason makes in demonstrative knowledge, there is an\nintuitive knowledge of that agreement or disagreement it seeks with the\nnext intermediate idea which it uses as a proof: for if it were not\nso, that yet would need a proof; since without the perception of such\nagreement or disagreement, there is no knowledge produced: if it\nbe perceived by itself, it is intuitive knowledge: if it cannot be\nperceived by itself, there is need of some intervening idea, as a common\nmeasure, to show their agreement or disagreement. By which it is plain,\nthat every step in reasoning that produces knowledge, has intuitive\ncertainty; which when the mind perceives, there is no more required\nbut to remember it, to make the agreement or disagreement of the ideas\nconcerning which we inquire visible and certain. So that to make\nanything a demonstration, it is necessary to perceive the immediate\nagreement of the intervening ideas, whereby the agreement or\ndisagreement of the two ideas under examination (whereof the one is\nalways the first, and the other the last in the account) is found.\nThis intuitive perception of the agreement or disagreement of the\nintermediate ideas, in each step and progression of the demonstration,\nmust also be carried exactly in the mind, and a man must be sure that no\npart is left out: which, because in long deductions, and the use of\nmany proofs, the memory does not always so readily and exactly retain;\ntherefore it comes to pass, that this is more imperfect than intuitive\nknowledge, and men embrace often falsehood for demonstrations.\n8. Hence the Mistake, ex praecognitis, et praeconcessis.\nThe necessity of this intuitive knowledge, in each step of scientifical\nor demonstrative reasoning, gave occasion, I imagine, to that mistaken\naxiom, That all reasoning was EX PRAECOGNITIS ET PRAECONCESSIS: which,\nhow far it is a mistake, I shall have occasion to show more at\nlarge, when I come to consider propositions, and particularly those\npropositions which are called maxims, and to show that it is by a\nmistake that they are supposed to be the foundations of all our\nknowledge and reasonings.\n9. Demonstration not limited to ideas of mathematical Quantity.\n[It has been generally taken for granted, that mathematics alone are\ncapable of demonstrative certainty: but to have such an agreement or\ndisagreement as may intuitively be perceived, being, as I imagine, not\nthe privilege of the ideas of number, extension, and figure alone, it\nmay possibly be the want of due method and application in us, and not of\nsufficient evidence in things, that demonstration has been thought to\nhave so little to do in other parts of knowledge, and been scarce so\nmuch as aimed at by any but mathematicians.] For whatever ideas we have\nwherein the mind can perceive the immediate agreement or disagreement\nthat is between them, there the mind is capable of intuitive knowledge;\nand where it can perceive the agreement or disagreement of any two\nideas, by an intuitive perception of the agreement or disagreement\nthey have with any intermediate ideas, there the mind is capable of\ndemonstration: which is not limited to ideas of extension, figure,\nnumber, and their modes.\n10. Why it has been thought to be so limited.\nThe reason why it has been generally sought for, and supposed to be only\nin those, I imagine has been, not only the general usefulness of those\nsciences; but because, in comparing their equality or excess, the modes\nof numbers have every the least difference very clear and perceivable:\nand though in extension every the least excess is not so perceptible,\nyet the mind has found out ways to examine, and discover\ndemonstratively, the just equality of two angles, or extensions, or\nfigures: and both these, i. e. numbers and figures, can be set down by\nvisible and lasting marks, wherein the ideas under consideration are\nperfectly determined; which for the most part they are not, where they\nare marked only by names and words.\n11. Modes of Qualities not demonstrable like modes of Quantity.\nBut in other simple ideas, whose modes and differences are made and\ncounted by degrees, and not quantity, we have not so nice and accurate\na distinction of their differences as to perceive, or find ways to\nmeasure, their just equality, or the least differences. For those other\nsimple ideas, being appearances of sensations produced in us, by the\nsize, figure, number, and motion of minute corpuscles singly insensible;\ntheir different degrees also depend upon the variation of some or of all\nthose causes: which, since it cannot be observed by us, in particles of\nmatter whereof each is too subtile to be perceived, it is impossible for\nus to have any exact measures of the different degrees of these simple\nideas. For, supposing the sensation or idea we name whiteness be\nproduced in us by a certain number of globules, which, having a\nverticity about their own centres, strike upon the retina of the eye,\nwith a certain degree of rotation, as well as progressive swiftness; it\nwill hence easily follow, that the more the superficial parts of any\nbody are so ordered as to reflect the greater number of globules of\nlight, and to give them the proper rotation, which is fit to produce\nthis sensation of white in us, the more white will that body appear,\nthat from an equal space sends to the retina the greater number of such\ncorpuscles, with that peculiar sort of motion. I do not say that the\nnature of light consists in very small round globules; nor of whiteness\nin such a texture of parts as gives a certain rotation to these globules\nwhen it reflects them: for I am not now treating physically of light or\ncolours. But this I think I may say, that I cannot (and I would be glad\nany one would make intelligible that he did) conceive how bodies without\nus can any ways affect our senses, but by the immediate contact of the\nsensible bodies themselves, as in tasting and feeling, or the impulse\nof some sensible particles coming from them, as in seeing, hearing,\nand smelling; by the different impulse of which parts, caused by their\ndifferent size, figure, and motion, the variety of sensations is\nproduced in us.\n12. Particles of light and simple ideas of colour.\nWhether then they be globules or no; or whether they have a verticity\nabout their own centres that produces the idea of whiteness in us; this\nis certain, that the more particles of light are reflected from a body,\nfitted to give them that peculiar motion which produces the sensation\nof whiteness in us; and possibly too, the quicker that peculiar motion\nis,--the whiter does the body appear from which the greatest number are\nreflected, as is evident in the same piece of paper put in the sunbeams,\nin the shade, and in a dark hole; in each of which it will produce in us\nthe idea of whiteness in far different degrees.\n13. The secondary Qualities of things not discovered by Demonstration.\nNot knowing, therefore, what number of particles, nor what motion of\nthem, is fit to produce any precise degree of whiteness, we cannot\nDEMONSTRATE the certain equality of any two degrees of whiteness;\nbecause we have no certain standard to measure them by, nor means to\ndistinguish every the least real difference, the only help we have being\nfrom our senses, which in this point fail us. But where the difference\nis so great as to produce in the mind clearly distinct ideas, whose\ndifferences can be perfectly retained, there these ideas or colours,\nas we see in different kinds, as blue and red, are as capable of\ndemonstration as ideas of number and extension. What I have here said of\nwhiteness and colours, I think holds true in all secondary qualities and\ntheir modes.\n14. III. Sensitive Knowledge of the particular Existence of finite\nbeings without us.\nThese two, viz. intuition and demonstration, are the degrees of our\nKNOWLEDGE; whatever comes short of one of these, with what assurance\nsoever embraced, is but FAITH or OPINION, but not knowledge, at least in\nall general truths. There is, indeed, another perception of the mind,\nemployed about THE PARTICULAR EXISTENCE OF FINITE BEINGS WITHOUT US,\nwhich, going beyond bare probability, and yet not reaching perfectly to\neither of the foregoing degrees of certainty, passes under the name\nof KNOWLEDGE. There can be nothing more certain than that the idea we\nreceive from an external object is in our minds: this is intuitive\nknowledge. But whether there be anything more than barely that idea\nin our minds; whether we can thence certainly infer the existence of\nanything without us, which corresponds to that idea, is that whereof\nsome men think there may be a question made; because men may have such\nideas in their minds, when no such thing exists, no such object affects\ntheir senses. But yet here I think we are provided with an evidence that\nputs us past doubting. For I ask any one, Whether he be not invincibly\nconscious to himself of a different perception, when he looks on the sun\nby day, and thinks on it by night; when he actually tastes wormwood, or\nsmells a rose, or only thinks on that savour or odour? We as plainly\nfind the difference there is between any idea revived in our minds by\nour own memory, and actually coming into our minds by our senses, as we\ndo between any two distinct ideas. If any one say, a dream may do the\nsame thing, and all these ideas may be produced, in us without\nany external objects; he may please to dream that I make him this\nanswer:--I. That it is no great matter, whether I remove his scruple or\nno: where all is but dream, reasoning and arguments are of no use, truth\nand knowledge nothing. 2. That I believe he will allow a very manifest\ndifference between dreaming of being in the fire, and being actually in\nit. But yet if he be resolved to appear so sceptical as to maintain,\nthat what I call being actually in the fire is nothing but a dream;\nand that we cannot thereby certainly know, that any such thing as fire\nactually exists without us: I answer, That we certainly finding that\npleasure or pain follows upon the application of certain objects to us,\nwhose existence we perceive, or dream that we perceive, by our senses;\nthis certainty is as great as our happiness or misery, beyond which we\nhave no concernment to know or to be. So that, I think, we may add\nto the two former sorts of knowledge this also, of the existence of\nparticular external objects, by that perception and consciousness we\nhave of the actual entrance of ideas from them, and allow these three\ndegrees of knowledge, viz. INTUITIVE, DEMONSTRATIVE, and SENSITIVE;\nin each of which there are different degrees and ways of evidence and\ncertainty.\n15. Knowledge not always clear, where the Ideas that enter into it are\nclear.\nBut since our knowledge is founded on and employed about our ideas only,\nwill it not follow from thence that it is conformable to our ideas; and\nthat where our ideas are clear and distinct, or obscure and confused,\nour knowledge will be so too? To which I answer, No: for our knowledge\nconsisting in the perception of the agreement or disagreement of any two\nideas, its clearness or obscurity consists in the clearness or obscurity\nof that perception, and not in the clearness or obscurity of the ideas\nthemselves: v. g. a man that has as clear ideas of the angles of a\ntriangle, and of equality to two right ones, as any mathematician in the\nworld, may yet have but a very obscure perception of their AGREEMENT,\nand so have but a very obscure knowledge of it. [But ideas which, by\nreason of their obscurity or otherwise, are confused, cannot produce any\nclear or distinct knowledge; because, as far as any ideas are confused,\nso far the mind cannot perceive clearly whether they agree or disagree.\nOr to express the same thing in a way less apt to be misunderstood:\nhe that hath not determined ideas to the words he uses, cannot make\npropositions of them of whose truth he can be certain.]\nCHAPTER III.\nOF THE EXTENT OF HUMAN KNOWLEDGE.\n1. Extent of our Knowledge.\nKnowledge, as has been said, lying in the perception of the agreement or\ndisagreement of any of our ideas, it follows from hence, That,\nFirst, it extends no further than we have Ideas.\nFirst, we can have knowledge no further than we have IDEAS.\n2. Secondly, It extends no further than we can perceive their Agreement\nor Disagreement.\nSecondly, That we can have no knowledge further than we can have\nPERCEPTION of that agreement or disagreement. Which perception being: 1.\nEither by INTUITION, or the immediate comparing any two ideas; or, 2.\nBy REASON, examining the agreement or disagreement of two ideas, by\nthe intervention of some others; or, 3. By SENSATION, perceiving the\nexistence of particular things: hence it also follows:\n3. Thirdly, Intuitive Knowledge extends itself not to all the relation\nof all our Ideas.\nThirdly, That we cannot have an INTUITIVE KNOWLEDGE that shall extend\nitself to all our ideas, and all that we would know about them; because\nwe cannot examine and perceive all the relations they have one to\nanother, by juxta-position, or an immediate comparison one with another.\nThus, having the ideas of an obtuse and an acute angled triangle, both\ndrawn from equal bases, and between parallels, I can, by intuitive\nknowledge, perceive the one not to be the other, but cannot that\nway know whether they be equal or no; because their agreement or\ndisagreement in equality can never be perceived by an immediate\ncomparing them: the difference of figure makes their parts incapable\nof an exact immediate application; and therefore there is need of some\nintervening qualities to measure them by, which is demonstration, or\nrational knowledge.\n4. Fourthly, Nor does Demonstrative Knowledge.\nFourthly, It follows, also, from what is above observed, that our\nRATIONAL KNOWLEDGE cannot reach to the whole extent of our ideas:\nbecause between two different ideas we would examine, we cannot always\nfind such mediums as we can connect one to another with an intuitive\nknowledge in all the parts of the deduction; and wherever that fails, we\ncome short of knowledge and demonstration.\n5. Fifthly, Sensitive Knowledge narrower than either.\nFifthly, SENSITIVE KNOWLEDGE reaching no further than the existence of\nthings actually present to our senses, is yet much narrower than either\nof the former.\n6. Sixthly, Our Knowledge, therefore narrower than our Ideas.\nSixthly, From all which it is evident, that the EXTENT OF OUR KNOWLEDGE\ncomes not only short of the reality of things, but even of the extent of\nour own ideas. Though our knowledge be limited to our ideas, and cannot\nexceed them either in extent or perfection; and though these be very\nnarrow bounds, in respect of the extent of All-being, and far short\nof what we may justly imagine to be in some even created understandings,\nnot tied down to the dull and narrow information that is to be received\nfrom some few, and not very acute, ways of perception, such as are our\nsenses; yet it would be well with us if our knowledge were but as large\nas our ideas, and there were not many doubts and inquiries CONCERNING\nTHE IDEAS WE HAVE, whereof we are not, nor I believe ever shall be in\nthis world resolved. Nevertheless, I do not question but that\nhuman knowledge, under the present circumstances of our beings and\nconstitutions, may be carried much further than it has hitherto been, if\nmen would sincerely, and with freedom of mind, employ all that industry\nand labour of thought, in improving the means of discovering truth,\nwhich they do for the colouring or support of falsehood, to maintain a\nsystem, interest, or party they are once engaged in. But yet after all,\nI think I may, without injury to human perfection, be confident,\nthat our knowledge would never reach to all we might desire to know\nconcerning those ideas we have; nor be able to surmount all the\ndifficulties, and resolve all the questions that might arise concerning\nany of them. We have the ideas of a SQUARE, a CIRCLE, and EQUALITY; and\nyet, perhaps, shall never be able to find a circle equal to a square,\nand certainly know that it is so. We have the ideas of MATTER and\nTHINKING, but possibly shall never be able to know whether [any mere\nmaterial being] thinks or no; it being impossible for us, by the\ncontemplation of our own ideas, without revelation, to discover whether\nOmnipotency has not given to some systems of matter, fitly disposed,\na power to perceive and think, or else joined and fixed to matter, so\ndisposed, a thinking immaterial substance: it being, in respect of our\nnotions, not much more remote from our comprehension to conceive that\nGOD can, if he pleases, superadd to matter A FACULTY OF THINKING, than\nthat he should superadd to it ANOTHER SUBSTANCE WITH A FACULTY OF\nTHINKING; since we know not wherein thinking consists, nor to what sort\nof substances the Almighty has been pleased to give that power, which\ncannot be in any created being, but merely by the good pleasure and\nbounty of the Creator. For I see no contradiction in it, that the first\nEternal thinking Being, or Omnipotent Spirit, should, if he pleased,\ngive to certain systems of created senseless matter, put together as he\nthinks fit, some degrees of sense, perception, and thought: though, as\nI think I have proved, lib. iv. ch. 10, Section 14, &c., it is no less\nthan a contradiction to suppose matter (which is evidently in its own\nnature void of sense and thought) should be that Eternal first-thinking\nBeing. What certainty of knowledge can any one have, that some\nperceptions, such as, v. g., pleasure and pain, should not be in some\nbodies themselves, after a certain manner modified and moved, as well as\nthat they should be in an immaterial substance, upon the motion of the\nparts of body: Body, as far as we can conceive, being able only to\nstrike and affect body, and motion, according to the utmost reach of our\nideas, being able to produce nothing but motion; so that when we allow\nit to produce pleasure or pain, or the idea of a colour or sound, we are\nfain to quit our reason, go beyond our ideas, and attribute it wholly to\nthe good pleasure of our Maker. For, since we must allow He has annexed\neffects to motion which we can no way conceive motion able to produce,\nwhat reason have we to conclude that He could not order them as well to\nbe produced in a subject we cannot conceive capable of them, as well as\nin a subject we cannot conceive the motion of matter can any way operate\nupon? I say not this, that I would any way lessen the belief of the\nsoul's immateriality: I am not here speaking of probability, but\nknowledge, and I think not only that it becomes the modesty of\nphilosophy not to pronounce magisterially, where we want that evidence\nthat can produce knowledge; but also, that it is of use to us to discern\nhow far our knowledge does reach; for the state we are at present in,\nnot being that of vision, we must in many things content ourselves\nwith faith and probability: and in the present question, about\nthe Immateriality of the Soul, if our faculties cannot arrive at\ndemonstrative certainty, we need not think it strange. All the great\nends of morality and religion are well enough secured, without\nphilosophical proofs of the soul's immateriality; since it is evident,\nthat he who made us at the beginning to subsist here, sensible\nintelligent beings, and for several years continued us in such a state,\ncan and will restore us to the like state of sensibility in another\nworld, and make us capable there to receive the retribution he has\ndesigned to men, according to their doings in this life. [And therefore\nit is not of such mighty necessity to determine one way or the other, as\nsome, over-zealous for or against the immateriality of the soul, have\nbeen forward to make the world believe. Who, either on the one side,\nindulging too much their thoughts immersed altogether in matter, can\nallow no existence to what is not material: or who, on the other side,\nfinding not COGITATION within the natural powers of matter, examined\nover and over again by the utmost intention of mind, have the confidence\nto conclude--That Omnipotency itself cannot give perception and thought\nto a substance which has the modification of solidity. He that considers\nhow hardly sensation is, in our thoughts, reconcilable to extended\nmatter; or existence to anything that has no extension at all, will\nconfess that he is very far from certainly knowing what his soul is.\nIt is a point which seems to me to be put out of the reach of our\nknowledge: and he who will give himself leave to consider freely, and\nlook into the dark and intricate part of each hypothesis, will scarce\nfind his reason able to determine him fixedly for or against the soul's\nmateriality. Since, on which side soever he views it, either as an\nUNEXTENDED SUBSTANCE, or as a THINKING EXTENDED MATTER, the difficulty\nto conceive either will, whilst either alone is in his thoughts, still\ndrive him to the contrary side. An unfair way which some men take with\nthemselves: who, because of the inconceivableness of something they find\nin one, throw themselves violently into the contrary hypothesis, though\naltogether as unintelligible to an unbiassed understanding. This serves\nnot only to show the weakness and the scantiness of our knowledge, but\nthe insignificant triumph of such sort of arguments; which, drawn from\nour own views, may satisfy us that we can find no certainty on one side\nof the question: but do not at all thereby help us to truth by running\ninto the opposite opinion; which, on examination, will be found clogged\nwith equal difficulties. For what safety, what advantage to any one is\nit, for the avoiding the seeming absurdities, and to him unsurmountable\nrubs, he meets with in one opinion, to take refuge in the contrary,\nwhich is built on something altogether as inexplicable, and as far\nremote from his comprehension? It is past controversy, that we have in\nus SOMETHING that thinks; our very doubts about what it is, confirm\nthe certainty of its being, though we must content ourselves in the\nignorance of what KIND of being it is: and it is in vain to go about to\nbe sceptical in this, as it is unreasonable in most other cases to be\npositive against the being of anything, because we cannot comprehend\nits nature. For I would fain know what substance exists, that has not\nsomething in it which manifestly baffles our understandings. Other\nspirits, who see and know the nature and inward constitution of things,\nhow much must they exceed us in knowledge? To which, if we add larger\ncomprehension, which enables them at one glance to see the connexion\nand agreement of very many ideas, and readily supplies to them the\nintermediate proofs, which we by single and slow steps, and long poring\nin the dark, hardly at last find out, and are often ready to forget one\nbefore we have hunted out another; we may guess at some part of the\nhappiness of superior ranks of spirits, who have a quicker and more\npenetrating sight, as well as a larger field of knowledge.]\nBut to return to the argument in hand: our knowledge, I say, is not only\nlimited to the paucity and imperfections of the ideas we have, and which\nwe employ it about, but even comes short of that too: but how far it\nreaches, let us now inquire.\n7. How far our Knowledge reaches.\nThe affirmations or negations we make concerning the ideas we have, may,\nas I have before intimated in general, be reduced to these four sorts,\nviz. identity, co-existence, relation, and real existence. I shall\nexamine how far our knowledge extends in each of these:\n8. Firstly, Our Knowledge of Identity and Diversity in ideas extends as\nfar as our Ideas themselves.\nFIRST, as to IDENTITY and DIVERSITY. In this way of agreement or\ndisagreement of our ideas, our intuitive knowledge is as far extended\nas our ideas themselves: and there can be no idea in the mind, which it\ndoes not, presently, by an intuitive knowledge, perceive to be what it\nis, and to be different from any other.\n9. Secondly, Of their Co-existence, extends only a very little way.\nSECONDLY, as to the second sort, which is the agreement or disagreement\nof our ideas in CO-EXISTENCE, in this our knowledge is very short;\nthough in this consists the greatest and most material part of our\nknowledge concerning substances. For our ideas of the species of\nsubstances being, as I have showed, nothing but certain collections of\nsimple ideas united in one subject, and so co-existing together; v.g.\nour idea of flame is a body hot, luminous, and moving upward; of gold,\na body heavy to a certain degree, yellow, malleable, and fusible: for\nthese, or some such complex ideas as these, in men's minds, do these two\nnames of the different substances, flame and gold, stand for. When we\nwould know anything further concerning these, or any other sort of\nsubstances, what do we inquire, but what OTHER qualities or powers these\nsubstances have or have not? Which is nothing else but to know what\nOTHER simple ideas do, or do not co-exist with those that make up that\ncomplex idea?\n10. Because the Connexion between simple Ideas in substances is for the\nmost part unknown.\nThis, how weighty and considerable a part soever of human science, is\nyet very narrow, and scarce any at all. The reason whereof is, that the\nsimple ideas whereof our complex ideas of substances are made up are,\nfor the most part, such as carry with them, in their own nature, no\nVISIBLE NECESSARY connexion or inconsistency with any other simple\nideas, whose co-existence with them we would inform ourselves about.\n11. Especially of the secondary Qualities of Bodies.\nThe ideas that our complex ones of substances are made up of, and about\nwhich our knowledge concerning substances is most employed, are those of\ntheir secondary qualities; which depending all (as has been shown) upon\nthe primary qualities of their minute and insensible parts; or, if not\nupon them, upon something yet more remote from our comprehension; it is\nimpossible we should know which have a NECESSARY union or inconsistency\none with another. For, not knowing the root they spring from, not\nknowing what size, figure, and texture of parts they are, on which\ndepend, and from which result those qualities which make our complex\nidea of gold, it is impossible we should know what OTHER qualities\nresult from, or are incompatible with, the same constitution of the\ninsensible parts of gold; and so consequently must always co-exist with\nthat complex idea we have of it, or else are inconsistent with it.\n12. Because necessary Connexion between any secondary and the primary\nQualities is undiscoverable by us.\nBesides this ignorance of the primary qualities of the insensible parts\nof bodies, on which depend all their secondary qualities, there is yet\nanother and more incurable part of ignorance, which sets us more remote\nfrom a certain knowledge of the co-existence or INCO-EXISTENCE (if I may\nso say) of different ideas in the same subject; and that is, that there\nis no discoverable connexion between any secondary quality and those\nprimary qualities which it depends on.\n13. We have no perfect knowledge of their Primary Qualities.\nThat the size, figure, and motion of one body should cause a change\nin the size, figure, and motion of another body, is not beyond our\nconception; the separation of the parts of one body upon the intrusion\nof another; and the change from rest to motion upon impulse; these and\nthe like seem to have SOME CONNEXION one with another. And if we knew\nthese primary qualities of bodies, we might have reason to hope we might\nbe able to know a great deal more of these operations of them one upon\nanother: but our minds not being able to discover any connexion betwixt\nthese primary qualities of bodies and the sensations that are produced\nin us by them, we can never be able to establish certain and undoubted\nrules of the CONSEQUENCE or CO-EXISTENCE of any secondary qualities,\nthough we could discover the size, figure, or motion of those invisible\nparts which immediately produce them. We are so far from knowing WHAT\nfigure, size, or motion of parts produce a yellow colour, a sweet taste,\nor a sharp sound, that we can by no means conceive how ANY size, figure,\nor motion of any particles, can possibly produce in us the idea of any\ncolour, taste, or sound whatsoever: there is no conceivable connexion\nbetween the one and the other.\n14. And seek in vain for certain and universal knowledge of unperceived\nqualities in substances.\nIn vain, therefore, shall we endeavour to discover by our ideas (the\nonly true way of certain and universal knowledge) what other ideas are\nto be found constantly joined with that of OUR complex idea of any\nsubstance: since we neither know the real constitution of the minute\nparts on which their qualities do depend; nor, did we know them,\ncould we discover any necessary connexion between them and any of\nthe secondary qualities: which is necessary to be done before we can\ncertainly know their necessary co-existence. So, that, let our complex\nidea of any species of substances be what it will, we can hardly, from\nthe simple ideas contained in it, certainly determine the necessary\nco-existence of any other quality whatsoever. Our knowledge in all these\ninquiries reaches very little further than our experience. Indeed some\nfew of the primary qualities have a necessary dependence and visible\nconnexion one with another, as figure necessarily supposes extension;\nreceiving or communicating motion by impulse, supposes solidity. But\nthough these, and perhaps some others of our ideas have: yet there are\nso few of them that have a visible connexion one with another, that we\ncan by intuition or demonstration discover the co-existence of very few\nof the qualities that are to be found united in substances: and we are\nleft only to the assistance of our senses to make known to us what\nqualities they contain. For of all the qualities that are co-existent\nin any subject, without this dependence and evident connexion of their\nideas one with another, we cannot know certainly any two to co-exist,\nany further than experience, by our senses, informs us. Thus, though we\nsee the yellow colour, and, upon trial, find the weight, malleableness,\nfusibility, and fixedness that are united in a piece of gold; yet,\nbecause no one of these ideas has any evident dependence or necessary\nconnexion with the other, we cannot certainly know that where any four\nof these are, the fifth will be there also, how highly probable soever\nit may be; because the highest probability amounts not to certainty,\nwithout which there can be no true knowledge. For this co-existence can\nbe no further known than it is perceived; and it cannot be perceived but\neither in particular subjects, by the observation of our senses, or, in\ngeneral, by the necessary connexion of the ideas themselves.\n15. Of Repugnancy to co-exist, our knowledge is larger.\nAs to the incompatibility or repugnancy to co-existence, we may know\nthat any subject may have of each sort of primary qualities but one\nparticular at once: v.g. each particular extension, figure, number of\nparts, motion, excludes all other of each kind. The like also is certain\nof all sensible ideas peculiar to each sense; for whatever of each kind\nis present in any subject, excludes all other of that sort: v.g. no one\nsubject can have two smells or two colours at the same time. To this,\nperhaps will be said, Has not an opal, or the infusion of LIGNUM\nNEPHRITICUM, two colours at the same time? To which I answer, that\nthese bodies, to eyes differently, placed, may at the same time afford\ndifferent colours: but I take liberty also to say, that, to eyes\ndifferently placed, it is different parts of the object that reflect the\nparticles of light: and therefore it is not the same part of the object,\nand so not the very same subject, which at the same time appears both\nyellow and azure. For, it is as impossible that the very same particle\nof any body should at the same time differently modify or reflect the\nrays of light, as that it should have two different figures and textures\nat the same time.\n16. Our Knowledge of the Co-existence of Power in Bodies extends but a\nvery little Way.\nBut as to the powers of substances to change the sensible qualities of\nother bodies, which make a great part of our inquiries about them, and\nis no inconsiderable branch of our knowledge; I doubt as to these,\nwhether our knowledge reaches much further than our experience; or\nwhether we can come to the discovery of most of these powers, and be\ncertain that they are in any subject, by the connexion with any of those\nideas which to us make its essence. Because the active and passive\npowers of bodies, and their ways of operating, consisting in a texture\nand motion of parts which we cannot by any means come to discover; it is\nbut in very few cases we can be able to perceive their dependence on,\nor repugnance to, any of those ideas which make our complex one of that\nsort of things. I have here instanced in the corpuscularian hypothesis,\nas that which is thought to go furthest in an intelligible explication\nof those qualities of bodies; and I fear the weakness of human\nunderstanding is scarce able to substitute another, which will afford\nus a fuller and clearer discovery of the necessary connexion and\nco-existence of the powers which are to be observed united in several\nsorts of them. This at least is certain, that, whichever hypothesis be\nclearest and truest, (for of that it is not my business to determine,)\nour knowledge concerning corporeal substances will be very little\nadvanced by any of them, till we are made to see what qualities and\npowers of bodies have a NECESSARY connexion or repugnancy one with\nanother; which in the present state of philosophy I think we know but to\na very small degree: and I doubt whether, with those faculties we\nhave, we shall ever be able to carry our general knowledge (I say not\nparticular experience) in this part much further. Experience is that\nwhich in this part we must depend on. And it were to be wished that it\nwere more improved. We find the advantages some men's generous pains\nhave this way brought to the stock of natural knowledge. And if others,\nespecially the philosophers by fire, who pretend to it, had been so wary\nin their observations, and sincere in their reports as those who call\nthemselves philosophers ought to have been, our acquaintance with the\nbodies here about us, and our insight into their powers and operations\nhad been yet much greater.\n17. Of the Powers that co-exist in Spirits yet narrower.\nIf we are at a loss in respect of the powers and operations of bodies, I\nthink it is easy to conclude we are much more in the dark in reference\nto spirits; whereof we naturally have no ideas but what we draw from\nthat of our own, by reflecting on the operations of our own souls\nwithin us, as far as they can come within our observation. But how\ninconsiderable a rank the spirits that inhabit our bodies hold amongst\nthose various and possibly innumerable kinds of nobler beings; and how\nfar short they come of the endowments and perfections of cherubim and\nseraphim, and infinite sorts of spirits above us, is what by a transient\nhint in another place I have offered to my reader's consideration.\n18. Thirdly, Of Relations between abstracted ideas it is not easy to say\nhow far our knowledge extends.\nTHIRDLY, As to the third sort of our knowledge, viz. the agreement or\ndisagreement of any of our ideas in any other relation: this, as it is\nthe largest field of our knowledge, so it is hard to determine how\nfar it may extend: because the advances that are made in this part of\nknowledge, depending on our sagacity in finding intermediate ideas, that\nmay show the relations and habitudes of ideas whose co-existence is not\nconsidered, it is a hard matter to tell when we are at an end of such\ndiscoveries; and when reason has all the helps it is capable of, for the\nfinding of proofs, or examining the agreement or disagreement of remote\nideas. They that are ignorant of Algebra cannot imagine the wonders in\nthis kind are to be done by it: and what further improvements and helps\nadvantageous to other parts of knowledge the sagacious mind of man may\nyet find out, it is not easy to determine. This at least I believe,\nthat the IDEAS OF QUANTITY are not those alone that are capable of\ndemonstration and knowledge; and that other, and perhaps more useful,\nparts of contemplation, would afford us certainty, if vices, passions,\nand domineering interest did not oppose or menace such endeavours.\nMorality capable of Demonstration\nThe idea of a supreme Being, infinite in power, goodness, and wisdom,\nwhose workmanship we are, and on whom we depend; and the idea of\nourselves, as understanding, rational creatures, being such as are clear\nin us, would, I suppose, if duly considered and pursued, afford such\nfoundations of our duty and rules of action as might place MORALITY\namongst the SCIENCES CAPABLE OF DEMONSTRATION: wherein I doubt not\nbut from self-evident propositions, by necessary consequences, as\nincontestible as those in mathematics, the measures of right and wrong\nmight be made out, to any one that will apply himself with the same\nindifferency and attention to the one as he does to the other of these\nsciences. The RELATION of other MODES may certainly be perceived, as\nwell as those of number and extension: and I cannot see why they should\nnot also be capable of demonstration, if due methods were thought on to\nexamine or pursue their agreement or disagreement. 'Where there is no\nproperty there is no injustice,' is a proposition as certain as any\ndemonstration in Euclid: for the idea of property being a right to\nanything, and the idea of which the name 'injustice' is given being the\ninvasion or violation of that right, it is evident that these ideas,\nbeing thus established, and these names annexed to them, I can as\ncertainly know this proposition to be true, as that a triangle has three\nangles equal to two right ones. Again: 'No government allows absolute\nliberty.' The idea of government being the establishment of society upon\ncertain rules or laws which require conformity to them; and the idea of\nabsolute liberty being for any one to do whatever he pleases; I am as\ncapable of being certain of the truth of this proposition as of any in\nthe mathematics.\n19. Two things have made moral Ideas to be thought incapable of\nDemonstration: their unfitness for sensible representation, and their\ncomplexedness.\nThat which in this respect has given the advantage to the ideas\nof quantity, and made them thought more capable of certainty and\ndemonstration, is,\nFirst, That they can be set down and represented by sensible marks,\nwhich have a greater and nearer correspondence with them than any words\nor sounds whatsoever. Diagrams drawn on paper are copies of the ideas in\nthe mind, and not liable to the uncertainty that words carry in their\nsignification. An angle, circle, or square, drawn in lines, lies open to\nthe view, and cannot be mistaken: it remains unchangeable, and may at\nleisure be considered and examined, and the demonstration be revised,\nand all the parts of it may be gone over more than once, without any\ndanger of the least change in the ideas. This cannot be thus done in\nmoral ideas: we have no sensible marks that resemble them, whereby we\ncan set them down; we have nothing but words to express them by; which,\nthough when written they remain the same, yet the ideas they stand for\nmay change in the same man; and it is very seldom that they are not\ndifferent in different persons.\nSecondly, Another thing that makes the greater difficulty in ethics is,\nThat moral ideas are commonly more complex than those of the\nfigures ordinarily considered in mathematics. From whence these two\ninconveniences follow:--First, that their names are of more uncertain\nsignification, the precise collection of simple ideas they stand for\nnot being so easily agreed on; and so the sign that is used for them in\ncommunication always, and in thinking often, does not steadily carry\nwith it the same idea. Upon which the same disorder, confusion, and\nerror follow, as would if a man, going to demonstrate something of an\nheptagon, should, in the diagram he took to do it, leave out one of the\nangles, or by oversight make the figure with one angle more than the\nname ordinarily imported, or he intended it should when at first\nhe thought of his demonstration. This often happens, and is hardly\navoidable in very complex moral ideas, where the same name being\nretained, one angle, i.e. one simple idea, is left out, or put in the\ncomplex one (still called by the same name) more at one time than\nanother. Secondly, From the complexedness of these moral ideas there\nfollows another inconvenience, viz. that the mind cannot easily retain\nthose precise combinations so exactly and perfectly as is necessary in\nthe examination of the habitudes and correspondences, agreements or\ndisagreements, of several of them one with another; especially where it\nis to be judged of by long deductions, and the intervention of several\nother complex ideas to show the agreement or disagreement of two remote\nones.\nThe great help against this which mathematicians find in diagrams and\nfigures, which remain unalterable in their draughts, is very apparent,\nand the memory would often have great difficulty otherwise to retain\nthem so exactly, whilst the mind went over the parts of them step by\nstep to examine their several correspondences. And though in casting up\na long sum either in addition, multiplication, or division, every part\nbe only a progression of the mind taking a view of its own ideas, and\nconsidering their agreement or disagreement, and the resolution of\nthe question be nothing but the result of the whole, made up of such\nparticulars, whereof the mind has a clear perception: yet, without\nsetting down the several parts by marks, whose precise significations\nare known, and by marks that last, and remain in view when the memory\nhad let them go, it would be almost impossible to carry so many\ndifferent ideas in the mind, without confounding or letting slip some\nparts of the reckoning, and thereby making all our reasonings about it\nuseless. In which case the cyphers or marks help not the mind at all to\nperceive the agreement of any two or more numbers, their equalities or\nproportions; that the mind has only by intuition of its own ideas of\nthe numbers themselves. But the numerical characters are helps to\nthe memory, to record and retain the several ideas about which the\ndemonstration is made, whereby a man may know how far his intuitive\nknowledge in surveying several of the particulars has proceeded; that so\nhe may without confusion go on to what is yet unknown; and at last have\nin one view before him the result of all his perceptions and reasonings.\n20. Remedies of our Difficulties in dealing demonstratively with moral\nideas.\nOne part of these disadvantages in moral ideas which has made them be\nthought not capable of demonstration, may in a good measure be remedied\nby definitions, setting down that collection of simple ideas, which\nevery term shall stand for; and then using the terms steadily and\nconstantly for that precise collection. And what methods algebra, or\nsomething of that kind, may hereafter suggest, to remove the other\ndifficulties, it is not easy to foretell. Confident I am, that, if men\nwould in the same method, and with the same indifferency, search after\nmoral as they do mathematical truths, they would find them have a\nstronger connexion one with another, and a more necessary consequence\nfrom our clear and distinct ideas, and to come nearer perfect\ndemonstration than is commonly imagined. But much of this is not to\nbe expected, whilst the desire of esteem, riches, or power makes men\nespouse the well-endowed opinions in fashion, and then seek arguments\neither to make good their beauty, or varnish over and cover their\ndeformity. Nothing being so beautiful to the eye as truth is to the\nmind; nothing so deformed and irreconcilable to the understanding as a\nlie. For though many a man can with satisfaction enough own a no very\nhandsome wife in his bosom; yet who is bold enough openly to avow that\nhe has espoused a falsehood, and received into his breast so ugly a\nthing as a lie? Whilst the parties of men cram their tenets down all\nmen's throats whom they can get into their power, without permitting\nthem to examine their truth or falsehood; and will not let truth have\nfair play in the world, nor men the liberty to search after it; what\nimprovements can be expected of this kind? What greater light can be\nhoped for in the moral sciences? The subject part of mankind in most\nplaces might, instead thereof, with Egyptian bondage, expect Egyptian\ndarkness, were not the candle of the Lord set up by himself in men's\nminds, which it is impossible for the breath or power of man wholly to\nextinguish.\n21. Fourthly, Of the three real Existences of which we have certain\nknowledge.\nFOURTHLY, As to the fourth sort of our knowledge, viz. of the REAL\nACTUAL EXISTENCE OF THINGS, we have an intuitive knowledge of OUR OWN\nEXISTENCE, and a demonstrative knowledge of the existence of a GOD:\nof the existence of ANYTHING ELSE, we have no other but a sensitive\nknowledge; which extends not beyond the objects present to our senses.\n22. Our Ignorance great.\nOur knowledge being so narrow, as I have shown, it will perhaps give us\nsome light into the present state of our minds if we look a little into\nthe dark side, and take a view of OUR IGNORANCE; which, being infinitely\nlarger than our knowledge, may serve much to the quieting of disputes,\nand improvement of useful knowledge; if, discovering how far we\nhave clear and distinct ideas, we confine our thoughts within the\ncontemplation of those things that are within the reach of our\nunderstandings, and launch not out into that abyss of darkness, (where\nwe have not eyes to see, nor faculties to perceive anything), out of\na presumption that nothing is beyond our comprehension. But to be\nsatisfied of the folly of such a conceit, we need not go far. He that\nknows anything, knows this, in the first place, that he need not seek\nlong for instances of his ignorance. The meanest and most obvious things\nthat come in our way have dark sides, that the quickest sight cannot\npenetrate into. The clearest and most enlarged understandings of\nthinking men find themselves puzzled and at a loss in every particle of\nmatter. We shall the less wonder to find it so, when we consider the\nCAUSES OF OUR IGNORANCE; which, from what has been said, I suppose will\nbe found to be these three:--\nFirst, Want of ideas. Its causes.\nSecondly, Want of a discoverable connexion between the ideas we have.\nThirdly, Want of tracing and examining our ideas.\n23. First, One Cause of our ignorance Want of Ideas.\nI. Want of simple ideas that other creatures in other parts of the\nuniverse may have.\nFIRST, There are some things, and those not a few, that we are ignorant\nof, for want of ideas.\nFirst, all the simple ideas we have are confined (as I have shown) to\nthose we receive from corporeal objects by sensation, and from the\noperations of our own minds as the objects of reflection. But how much\nthese few and narrow inlets are disproportionate to the vast whole\nextent of all beings, will not be hard to persuade those who are not so\nfoolish as to think their span the measure of all things. What other\nsimple ideas it is possible the creatures in other parts of the universe\nmay have, by the assistance of senses and faculties more or perfecter\nthan we have, or different from ours, it is not for us to determine. But\nto say or think there are no such, because we conceive nothing of them,\nis no better an argument than if a blind man should be positive in it,\nthat there was no such thing as sight and colours, because he had no\nmanner of idea of any such thing, nor could by any means frame to\nhimself any notions about seeing. The ignorance and darkness that is in\nus no more hinders nor confines the knowledge that is in others, than\nthe blindness of a mole is an argument against the quicksightedness of\nan eagle. He that will consider the infinite power, wisdom, and goodness\nof the Creator of all things will find reason to think it was not all\nlaid out upon so inconsiderable, mean, and impotent a creature as he\nwill find man to be; who in all probability is one of the lowest of\nall intellectual beings. What faculties, therefore, other species of\ncreatures have to penetrate into the nature and inmost constitutions of\nthings; what ideas they may receive of them far different from ours, we\nknow not. This we know and certainly find, that we want several other\nviews of them besides those we have, to make discoveries of them more\nperfect. And we may be convinced that the ideas we can attain to by\nour faculties are very disproportionate to things themselves, when\na positive, clear, distinct one of substance itself, which is the\nfoundation of all the rest, is concealed from us. But want of ideas of\nthis kind, being a part as well as cause of our ignorance, cannot be\ndescribed. Only this I think I may confidently say of it, That the\nintellectual and sensible world are in this perfectly alike: that that\npart which we see of either of them holds no proportion with what we see\nnot; and whatsoever we can reach with our eyes or our thoughts of either\nof them is but a point, almost nothing in comparison of the the rest.\n24. Want of simple ideas that men are capable of having, but having\nnot,(1) Because their remoteness, or,\nSecondly, Another great cause of ignorance is the want of ideas we are\ncapable of. As the want of ideas which our faculties are not able\nto give us shuts us wholly from those views of things which it is\nreasonable to think other beings, perfecter than we, have, of which we\nknow nothing; so the want of ideas I now speak of keeps us in ignorance\nof things we conceive capable of being known to us. Bulk, figure, and\nmotion we have ideas of. But though we are not without ideas of these\nprimary qualities of bodies in general, yet not knowing what is the\nparticular bulk, figure, and motion, of the greatest part of the bodies\nof the universe, we are ignorant of the several powers, efficacies, and\nways of operation, whereby the effects which we daily see are produced.\nThese are hid from us, in some things by being too remote, and in others\nby being too minute. When we consider the vast distance of the known and\nvisible parts of the world, and the reasons we have to think that what\nlies within our ken is but a small part of the universe, we shall then\ndiscover a huge abyss of ignorance. What are the particular fabrics of\nthe great masses of matter which make up the whole stupendous frame of\ncorporeal beings; how far they are extended; what is their motion, and\nhow continued or communicated; and what influence they have one upon\nanother, are contemplations that at first glimpse our thoughts lose\nthemselves in. If we narrow our contemplations, and confine our thoughts\nto this little canton--I mean this system of our sun, and the grosser\nmasses of matter that visibly move about it, What several sorts of\nvegetables, animals, and intellectual corporeal beings, infinitely\ndifferent from those of our little spot of earth, may there probably be\nin the other planets, to the knowledge of which, even of their outward\nfigures and parts, we can no way attain whilst we are confined to this\nearth; there being no natural means, either by sensation or reflection,\nto convey their certain ideas into our minds? They are out of the reach\nof those inlets of all our knowledge: and what sorts of furniture and\ninhabitants those mansions contain in them we cannot so much as guess,\nmuch less have clear and distinct ideas of them.\n25. (2) Because of their Minuteness.\nIf a great, nay, far the greatest part of the several ranks of bodies\nin the universe escape our notice by their remoteness, there are others\nthat are no less concealed from us by their minuteness. These INSENSIBLE\nCORPUSCLES, being the active parts of matter, and the great instruments\nof nature, on which depend not only all their secondary qualities, but\nalso most of their natural operations, our want of precise distinct\nideas of their primary qualities keeps us in an incurable ignorance of\nwhat we desire to know about them. I doubt not but if we could discover\nthe figure, size, texture, and motion of the minute constituent parts of\nany two bodies, we should know without trial several of their operations\none upon another; as we do now the properties of a square or a triangle.\nDid we know the mechanical affections of the particles of rhubarb,\nhemlock, opium, and a man, as a watchmaker does those of a watch,\nwhereby it performs its operations; and of a file, which by rubbing on\nthem will alter the figure of any of the wheels; we should be able to\ntell beforehand that rhubarb will purge, hemlock kill, and opium make\na man sleep: as well as a watchmaker can, that a little piece of paper\nlaid on the balance will keep the watch from going till it be removed;\nor that, some small part of it being rubbed by a file, the machine would\nquite lose its motion, and the watch go no more. The dissolving of\nsilver in AQUA FORTIS, and gold in AQUA REGIA, and not VICE VERSA, would\nbe then perhaps no more difficult to know than it is to a smith to\nunderstand why the turning of one key will open a lock, and not the\nturning of another. But whilst we are destitute of senses acute enough\nto discover the minute particles of bodies, and to give us ideas of\ntheir mechanical affections, we must be content to be ignorant of their\nproperties and ways of operation; nor can we be assured about them any\nfurther than some few trials we make are able to reach. But whether they\nwill succeed again another time, we cannot be certain. This hinders our\ncertain knowledge of universal truths concerning natural bodies: and our\nreason carries us herein very little beyond particular matter of fact.\n26. Hence no Science of Bodies within our reach.\nAnd therefore I am apt to doubt that, how far soever human industry\nmay advance useful and experimental philosophy in physical things,\nSCIENTIFICAL will still be out of our reach: because we want perfect and\nadequate ideas of those very bodies which are nearest to us, and most\nunder our command. Those which we have ranked into classes under names,\nand we think ourselves best acquainted with, we have but very imperfect\nand incomplete ideas of. Distinct ideas of the several sorts of bodies\nthat fall under the examination of our senses perhaps we may have: but\nadequate ideas, I suspect, we have not of any one amongst them. And\nthough the former of these will serve us for common use and discourse,\nyet whilst we want the latter, we are not capable of scientifical\nknowledge; nor shall ever be able to discover general, instructive,\nunquestionable truths concerning them. CERTAINTY and DEMONSTRATION are\nthings we must not, in these matters, pretend to. By the colour, figure,\ntaste, and smell, and other sensible qualities, we have as clear and\ndistinct ideas of sage and hemlock, as we have of a circle and a\ntriangle: but having no ideas of the particular primary qualities of the\nminute parts of either of these plants, nor of other bodies which we\nwould apply them to, we cannot tell what effects they will produce; nor\nwhen we see those effects can we so much as guess, much less know, their\nmanner of production. Thus, having no ideas of the particular mechanical\naffections of the minute parts of bodies that are within our view and\nreach, we are ignorant of their constitutions, powers, and operations:\nand of bodies more remote we are yet more ignorant, not knowing so much\nas their very outward shapes, or the sensible and grosser parts of their\nconstitutions.\n27. Much less a science of unembodied Spirits.\nThis at first will show us how disproportionate our knowledge is to\nthe whole extent even of material beings; to which if we add the\nconsideration of that infinite number of spirits that may be, and\nprobably are, which are yet more remote from our knowledge, whereof we\nhave no cognizance, nor can frame to ourselves any distinct ideas of\ntheir several ranks and sorts, we shall find this cause of ignorance\nconceal from us, in an impenetrable obscurity, almost the whole\nintellectual world; a greater certainly, and more beautiful world than\nthe material. For, bating some very few, and those, if I may so call\nthem, superficial ideas of spirit, which by reflection we get of our\nown, and from thence the best we can collect of the Father of all\nspirits, the eternal independent Author of them, and us, and all things,\nwe have no certain information, so much as of the existence of other\nspirits, but by revelation. Angels of all sorts are naturally beyond our\ndiscovery; and all those intelligences, whereof it is likely there are\nmore orders than of corporeal substances, are things whereof our natural\nfaculties give us no certain account at all. That there are minds and\nthinking beings in other men as well as himself, every man has a reason,\nfrom their words and actions, to be satisfied: and the knowledge of his\nown mind cannot suffer a man that considers, to be ignorant that there\nis a God. But that there are degrees of spiritual beings between us and\nthe great God, who is there, that, by his own search and ability, can\ncome to know? Much less have we distinct ideas of their different\nnatures, conditions, states, powers, and several constitutions wherein\nthey agree or differ from one another and from us. And, therefore, in\nwhat concerns their different species and properties we are in absolute\nignorance.\n28. Secondly, Another cause, Want of a discoverable Connexion between\nIdeas we have.\nSECONDLY, What a small part of the substantial beings that are in the\nuniverse the want of ideas leaves open to our knowledge, we have seen.\nIn the next place, another cause of ignorance, of no less moment, is\na want of a discoverable connection between those ideas we have. For\nwherever we want that, we are utterly incapable of universal and certain\nknowledge; and are, in the former case, left only to observation and\nexperiment: which, how narrow and confined it is, how far from general\nknowledge we need not be told. I shall give some few instances of this\ncause of our ignorance, and so leave it. It is evident that the bulk,\nfigure, and motion of several bodies about us produce in us several\nsensations, as of colours, sounds, tastes, smells, pleasure, and pain,\n&c. These mechanical affections of bodies having no affinity at all with\nthose ideas they produce in us, (there being no conceivable connexion\nbetween any impulse of any sort of body and any perception of a colour\nor smell which we find in our minds,) we can have no distinct knowledge\nof such operations beyond our experience; and can reason no otherwise\nabout them, than as effects produced by the appointment of an infinitely\nWise Agent, which perfectly surpass our comprehensions. As the ideas of\nsensible secondary qualities which we have in our minds, can by us be no\nway deduced from bodily causes, nor any correspondence or connexion be\nfound between them and those primary qualities which (experience shows\nus) produce them in us; so, on the other side, the operation of our\nminds upon our bodies is as inconceivable. How any thought should\nproduce a motion in body is as remote from the nature of our ideas, as\nhow any body should produce any thought in the mind. That it is so,\nif experience did not convince us, the consideration of the things\nthemselves would never be able in the least to discover to us. These,\nand the like, though they have a constant and regular connexion in the\nordinary course of things; yet that connexion being not discoverable in\nthe ideas themselves, which appearing to have no necessary dependence\none on another, we can attribute their connexion to nothing else but the\narbitrary determination of that All-wise Agent who has made them to be,\nand to operate as they do, in a way wholly above our weak understandings\nto conceive.\n29. Instances\nIn some of our ideas there are certain relations, habitudes, and\nconnexions, so visibly included in the nature of the ideas themselves,\nthat we cannot conceive them separable from them by any power\nwhatsoever. And in these only we are capable of certain and universal\nknowledge. Thus the idea of a right-lined triangle necessarily carries\nwith it an equality of its angles to two right ones. Nor can we conceive\nthis relation, this connexion of these two ideas, to be possibly\nmutable, or to depend on any arbitrary power, which of choice made it\nthus, or could make it otherwise. But the coherence and continuity of\nthe parts of matter; the production of sensation in us of colours\nand sounds, &c., by impulse and motion; nay, the original rules and\ncommunication of motion being such, wherein we can discover no natural\nconnexion with any ideas we have, we cannot but ascribe them to the\narbitrary will and good pleasure of the Wise Architect. I need not, I\nthink, here mention the resurrection of the dead, the future state of\nthis globe of earth, and such other things, which are by every one\nacknowledged to depend wholly on the determination of a free agent. The\nthings that, as far as our observation reaches, we constantly find to\nproceed regularly, we may conclude do act by a law set them; but yet\nby a law that we know not: whereby, though causes work steadily, and\neffects constantly flow from them, yet their connexions and dependencies\nbeing not discoverable in our ideas, we can have but an experimental\nknowledge of them. From all which it is easy to perceive what a darkness\nwe are involved in, how little it is of Being, and the things that are,\nthat we are capable to know. And therefore we shall do no injury to our\nknowledge, when we modestly think with ourselves, that we are so far\nfrom being able to comprehend the whole nature of the universe, and all\nthe things contained in it, that we are not capable of a philosophical\nknowledge of the bodies that are about us, and make a part of us:\nconcerning their secondary qualities, powers, and operations, we can\nhave no universal certainty. Several effects come every day within the\nnotice of our senses, of which we have so far sensitive knowledge: but\nthe causes, manner, and certainty of their production, for the two\nforegoing reasons, we must be content to be very ignorant of. In these\nwe can go no further than particular experience informs us of matter of\nfact, and by analogy to guess what effects the like bodies are, upon\nother trials, like to produce. But as to a PERFECT SCIENCE of natural\nbodies, (not to mention spiritual beings,) we are, I think, so far from\nbeing capable of any such thing, that I conclude it lost labour to seek\nafter it.\n30. Thirdly A third cause, Want of Tracing our ideas.\nTHIRDLY, Where we have adequate ideas, and where there is a certain and\ndiscoverable connexion between them, yet we are often ignorant, for\nwant of tracing those ideas which we have or may have; and for want of\nfinding out those intermediate ideas, which may show us what habitude of\nagreement or disagreement they have one with another. And thus many are\nignorant of mathematical truths, not out of any imperfection of their\nfaculties, or uncertainty in the things themselves, but for want of\napplication in acquiring, examining, and by due ways comparing those\nideas. That which has most contributed to hinder the due tracing of our\nideas, and finding out their relations, and agreements or disagreements,\none with another, has been, I suppose, the ill use of words. It is\nimpossible that men should ever truly seek or certainly discover the\nagreement or disagreement of ideas themselves, whilst their thoughts\nflutter about, or stick only in sounds of doubtful and uncertain\nsignifications. Mathematicians abstracting their thoughts from names,\nand accustoming themselves to set before their minds the ideas\nthemselves that they would consider, and not sounds instead of them,\nhave avoided thereby a great part of that perplexity, puddering, and\nconfusion, which has so much hindered men's progress in other parts of\nknowledge. For whilst they stick in words of undetermined and uncertain\nsignification, they are unable to distinguish true from false, certain\nfrom probable, consistent from inconsistent, in their own opinions. This\nhaving been the fate or misfortune of a great part of men of letters,\nthe increase brought into the stock of real knowledge has been very\nlittle, in proportion to the schools disputes, and writings, the world\nhas been filled with; whilst students, being lost in the great wood of\nwords, knew not whereabouts they were, how far their discoveries were\nadvanced, or what was wanting in their own, or the general stock of\nknowledge. Had men, in the discoveries of the material, done as they\nhave in those of the intellectual world, involved all in the obscurity\nof uncertain and doubtful ways of talking, volumes writ of navigation\nand voyages, theories and stories of zones and tides, multiplied and\ndisputed; nay, ships built, and fleets sent out, would never have taught\nus the way beyond the line; and the Antipodes would be still as much\nunknown, as when it was declared heresy to hold there were any. But\nhaving spoken sufficiently of words, and the ill or careless use that is\ncommonly made of them, I shall not say anything more of it here.\n31. Extent of Human Knowledge in respect to its Universality.\nHitherto we have examined the extent of our knowledge, in respect of\nthe several sorts of beings that are. There is another extent of it, in\nrespect of UNIVERSALITY, which will also deserve to be considered; and\nin this regard, our knowledge follows the nature of our ideas. If the\nideas are abstract, whose agreement or disagreement we perceive, our\nknowledge is universal. For what is known of such general ideas, will be\ntrue of every particular thing in whom that essence, i.e. that abstract\nidea, is to be found: and what is once known of such ideas, will be\nperpetually and for ever true. So that as to all GENERAL KNOWLEDGE we\nmust search and find it only in our minds; and it is only the examining\nof our own ideas that furnisheth us with that. Truths belonging to\nessences of things (that is, to abstract ideas) are eternal; and are\nto be found out by the contemplation only of those essences: as the\nexistence of things is to be known only from experience. But having more\nto say of this in the chapters where I shall speak of general and real\nknowledge, this may here suffice as to the universality of our knowledge\nin general.\nCHAPTER IV. OF THE REALITY OF KNOWLEDGE.\n1. Objection. 'Knowledge placed in our Ideas may be all unreal or\nchimerical'\nI DOUBT not but my reader, by this time, may be apt to think that I have\nbeen all this while only building a castle in the air; and be ready to\nsay to me:--\n'To what purpose all this stir? Knowledge, say you, is only the\nperception of the agreement or disagreement of our own ideas: but who\nknows what those ideas may be? Is there anything so extravagant as the\nimaginations of men's brains? Where is the head that has no chimeras in\nit? Or if there be a sober and a wise man, what difference will\nthere be, by your rules, between his knowledge and that of the most\nextravagant fancy in the world? They both have their ideas, and perceive\ntheir agreement and disagreement one with another. If there be any\ndifference between them, the advantage will be on the warm-headed man's\nside, as having the more ideas, and the more lively. And so, by your\nrules, he will be the more knowing. If it be true, that all knowledge\nlies only in the perception of the agreement or disagreement of our own\nideas, the visions of an enthusiast and the reasonings of a sober man\nwill be equally certain. It is no matter how things are: so a man\nobserve but the agreement of his own imaginations, and talk conformably,\nit is all truth, all certainty. Such castles in the air will be as\nstrongholds of truth, as the demonstrations of Euclid. That an harpy is\nnot a centaur is by this way as certain knowledge, and as much a truth,\nas that a square is not a circle.\n'But of what use is all this fine knowledge of MEN'S OWN IMAGINATIONS,\nto a man that inquires after the reality of things? It matters not what\nmen's fancies are, it is the knowledge of things that is only to be\nprized: it is this alone gives a value to our reasonings, and preference\nto one man's knowledge over another's, that it is of things as they\nreally are, and not of dreams and fancies.'\n2. Answer Not so, where Ideas agree with Things.\nTo which I answer, That if our knowledge of our ideas terminate in them,\nand reach no further, where there is something further intended, our\nmost serious thoughts will be of little more use than the reveries of\na crazy brain; and the truths built thereon of no more weight than the\ndiscourses of a man who sees things clearly in a dream, and with great\nassurance utters them. But I hope, before I have done, to make it\nevident, that this way of certainty, by the knowledge of our own ideas,\ngoes a little further than bare imagination: and I believe it will\nappear that all the certainty of general truths a man has lies in\nnothing else.\n3. But what shall be the criterion of this agreement?\nIt is evident the mind knows not things immediately, but only by the\nintervention of the ideas it has of them. Our knowledge, therefore, is\nreal only so far as there is a CONFORMITY between our ideas and the\nreality of things. But what shall be here the criterion? How shall the\nmind, when it perceives nothing but its own ideas, know that they agree\nwith things themselves? This, though it seems not to want difficulty,\nyet, I think, there be two sorts of ideas that we may be assured agree\nwith things.\n4. As, First All Simple Ideas are really conformed to Things.\nFIRST, The first are simple ideas, which since the mind, as has been\nshowed, can by no means make to itself, must necessarily be the product\nof things operating on the mind, in a natural way, and producing therein\nthose perceptions which by the Wisdom and Will of our Maker they are\nordained and adapted to. From whence it follows, that simple ideas are\nnot fictions of our fancies, but the natural and regular productions of\nthings without us, really operating upon us; and so carry with them all\nthe conformity which is intended; or which our state requires: for they\nrepresent to us things under those appearances which they are fitted\nto produce in us: whereby we are enabled to distinguish the sorts of\nparticular substances, to discern the states they are in, and so to take\nthem for our necessities, and apply them to our uses. Thus the idea of\nwhiteness, or bitterness, as it is in the mind, exactly answering\nthat power which is in any body to produce it there, has all the real\nconformity it can or ought to have, with things without us. And this\nconformity between our simple ideas and the existence of things, is\nsufficient for real knowledge.\n5. Secondly, All Complex Ideas, except ideas of Substances, are their\nown archetypes.\nSecondly, All our complex ideas, EXCEPT THOSE OF SUBSTANCES, being\narchetypes of the mind's own making, not intended to be the copies\nof anything, nor referred to the existence of anything, as to their\noriginals, cannot want any conformity necessary to real knowledge. For\nthat which is not designed to represent anything but itself, can never\nbe capable of a wrong representation, nor mislead us from the true\napprehension of anything, by its dislikeness to it: and such, excepting\nthose of substances, are all our complex ideas. Which, as I have showed\nin another place, are combinations of ideas, which the mind, by its free\nchoice, puts together, without considering any connexion they have in\nnature. And hence it is, that in all these sorts the ideas themselves\nare considered as the archetypes, and things no otherwise regarded, but\nas they are conformable to them. So that we cannot but be infallibly\ncertain, that all the knowledge we attain concerning these ideas is\nreal, and reaches things themselves. Because in all our thoughts,\nreasonings, and discourses of this kind, we intend things no further\nthan as they are conformable to our ideas. So that in these we cannot\nmiss of a certain and undoubted reality.\n6. Hence the reality of Mathematical Knowledge\nI doubt not but it will be easily granted, that the knowledge we have of\nmathematical truths is not only certain, but real knowledge; and not the\nbare empty vision of vain, insignificant chimeras of the brain: and yet,\nif we will consider, we shall find that it is only of our own ideas.\nThe mathematician considers the truth and properties belonging to a\nrectangle or circle only as they are in idea in his own mind. For it is\npossible he never found either of them existing mathematically, i.e.\nprecisely true, in his life. But yet the knowledge he has of any truths\nor properties belonging to a circle, or any other mathematical figure,\nare nevertheless true and certain, even of real things existing: because\nreal things are no further concerned, nor intended to be meant by any\nsuch propositions, than as things really agree to those archetypes in\nhis mind. Is it true of the IDEA of a triangle, that its three angles\nare equal to two right ones? It is true also of a triangle, wherever\nit REALLY EXISTS. Whatever other figure exists, that it is not exactly\nanswerable to that idea of a triangle in his mind, is not at all\nconcerned in that proposition. And therefore he is certain all his\nknowledge concerning such ideas is real knowledge: because, intending\nthings no further than they agree with those his ideas, he is sure\nwhat he knows concerning those figures, when they have BARELY AN IDEAL\nEXISTENCE in his mind, will hold true of them also when they have A REAL\nEXISTANCE in matter: his consideration being barely of those figures,\nwhich are the same wherever or however they exist.\n7. And of Moral.\nAnd hence it follows that moral knowledge is as capable of real\ncertainty as mathematics. For certainty being but the perception of the\nagreement or disagreement of our ideas, and demonstration nothing but\nthe perception of such agreement, by the intervention of other ideas\nor mediums; our moral ideas, as well as mathematical, being archetypes\nthemselves, and so adequate and complete ideas; all the agreement or\ndisagreement which we shall find in them will produce real knowledge, as\nwell as in mathematical figures.\n8. Existence not required to make Abstract Knowledge real.\n[For the attaining of knowledge and certainty, it is requisite that we\nhave determined ideas:] and, to make our knowledge real, it is requisite\nthat the ideas answer their archetypes. Nor let it be wondered, that I\nplace the certainty of our knowledge in the consideration of our ideas,\nwith so little care and regard (as it may seem) to the real existence of\nthings: since most of those discourses which take up the thoughts and\nengage the disputes of those who pretend to make it their business to\ninquire after truth and certainty, will, I presume, upon examination, be\nfound to be general propositions, and notions in which existence is not\nat all concerned. All the discourses of the mathematicians about the\nsquaring of a circle, conic sections, or any other part of mathematics,\nconcern not the existence of any of those figures: but their\ndemonstrations, which depend on their ideas, are the same, whether there\nbe any square or circle existing in the world or no. In the same manner,\nthe truth and certainty of moral discourses abstracts from the lives of\nmen, and the existence of those virtues in the world whereof they treat:\nnor are Tully's Offices less true, because there is nobody in the world\nthat exactly practises his rules, and lives up to that pattern of a\nvirtuous man which he has given us, and which existed nowhere when he\nwrit but in idea. If it be true in speculation, i.e. in idea, that\nmurder deserves death, it will also be true in reality of any action\nthat exists conformable to that idea of murder. As for other\nactions, the truth of that proposition concerns them not. And thus it is\nof all other species of things, which have no other essences but those\nideas which are in the minds of men.\n9. Nor will it be less true or certain, because Moral Ideas are of our\nown making and naming.\nBut it will here be said, that if moral knowledge be placed in the\ncontemplation of our own moral ideas, and those, as other modes, be\nof our own making, What strange notions will there be of justice and\ntemperance? What confusion of virtues and vices, if every one may make\nwhat ideas of them he pleases? No confusion or disorder in the things\nthemselves, nor the reasonings about them; no more than (in mathematics)\nthere would be a disturbance in the demonstration, or a change in the\nproperties of figures, and their relations one to another, if a man\nshould make a triangle with four corners, or a trapezium with four right\nangles: that is, in plain English, change the names of the figures, and\ncall that by one name, which mathematicians call ordinarily by another.\nFor, let a man make to himself the idea of a figure with three angles,\nwhereof one is a right one, and call it, if he please, EQUILATERUM or\nTRAPEZIUM, or anything else; the properties of, and demonstrations about\nthat idea will be the same as if he called it a rectangular triangle. I\nconfess the change of the name, by the impropriety of speech, will at\nfirst disturb him who knows not what idea it stands for: but as soon as\nthe figure is drawn, the consequences and demonstrations are plain and\nclear. Just the same is it in moral knowledge: let a man have the idea\nof taking from others, without their consent, what their honest industry\nhas possessed them of, and call this JUSTICE if he please. He that takes\nthe name here without the idea put to it will be mistaken, by joining\nanother idea of his own to that name: but strip the idea of that name,\nor take it such as it is in the speaker's mind, and the same things will\nagree to it, as if you called it INJUSTICE. Indeed, wrong names in moral\ndiscourses breed usually more disorder, because they are not so easily\nrectified as in mathematics, where the figure, once drawn and seen,\nmakes the name useless and of no force. For what need of a sign, when\nthe thing signified is present and in view? But in moral names, that\ncannot be so easily and shortly done, because of the many decompositions\nthat go to the making up the complex ideas of those modes. But yet for\nall this, the miscalling of any of those ideas, contrary to the usual\nsignification of the words of that language, hinders not but that we may\nhave certain and demonstrative knowledge of their several agreements and\ndisagreements, if we will carefully, as in mathematics, keep to the same\nprecise ideas, and trace THEM in their several relations one to another,\nwithout being led away by their names. If we but separate the idea under\nconsideration from the sign that stands for it, our knowledge goes\nequally on in the discovery of real truth and certainty, whatever sounds\nwe make use of.\n10. Misnaming disturbs not the certainty of the Knowledge\nOne thing more we are to take notice of, That where God or any other\nlaw-maker, hath defined any moral names, there they have made the\nessence of that species to which that name belongs; and there it is\nnot safe to apply or use them otherwise: but in other cases it is bare\nimpropriety of speech to apply them contrary to the common usage of\nthe country. But yet even this too disturbs not the certainty of that\nknowledge, which is still to be had by a due contemplation and comparing\nof those even nick-named ideas.\n11. Thirdly, Our complex Ideas of Substances have their Archetypes\nwithout us; and here knowledge comes short.\nTHIRDLY, There is another sort of complex ideas, which, being referred\nto archetypes without us, may differ from them, and so our knowledge\nabout them may come short of being real. Such are our ideas of\nsubstances, which, consisting of a collection of simple ideas, supposed\ntaken from the works of nature, may yet vary from them; by having more\nor different ideas united in them than are to be found united in the\nthings themselves. From whence it comes to pass, that they may, and\noften do, fail of being exactly conformable to things themselves.\n12. So far as our complex ideas agree with those Archetypes without us,\nso far our Knowledge concerning Substances is real.\nI say, then, that to have ideas of SUBSTANCES which, by being\nconformable to things, may afford us real knowledge, it is not enough,\nas in MODES, to put together such ideas as have no inconsistence, though\nthey did never before so exist: v.g. the ideas of sacrilege or perjury,\n&c., were as real and true ideas before, as after the existence of any\nsuch fact. But our ideas of substances, being supposed copies, and\nreferred to archetypes without us, must still be taken from something\nthat does or has existed: they must not consist of ideas put together at\nthe pleasure of our thoughts, without any real pattern they were taken\nfrom, though we can perceive no inconsistence in such a combination. The\nreason whereof is because we, knowing not what real constitution it is\nof substances whereon our simple ideas depend, and which really is the\ncause of the strict union of some of them one with another, and the\nexclusion of others; there are very few of them that we can be sure\nare or are not inconsistent in nature: any further than experience and\nsensible observation reach Herein, therefore, is founded the reality of\nour knowledge concerning substances--That all our complex ideas of them\nmust be such, and such only, as are made up of such simple ones as have\nbeen discovered to co-exist in nature. And our ideas being thus true,\nthough not perhaps very exact copies, are yet the subjects of real (as\nfar as we have any) knowledge of them. Which (as has been already shown)\nwill not be found to reach very far: but so far as it does, it will\nstill be real knowledge. Whatever ideas we have, the agreement we\nfind they have with others will still be knowledge. If those ideas be\nabstract, it will be general knowledge. But to make it real concerning\nsubstances, the ideas must be taken from the real existence of things.\nWhatever simple ideas have been found to co-exist in any substance,\nthese we may with confidence join together again, and so make abstract\nideas of substances. For whatever have once had an union in nature, may\nbe united again.\n13. In our inquiries about Substances, we must consider Ideas, and not\nconfine our Thoughts to Names, or Species supposed set out by Names.\nThis, if we rightly consider, and confine not our thoughts and abstract\nideas to names, as if there were, or could be no other SORTS of things\nthan what known names had already determined, and, as it were, set out,\nwe should think of things with greater freedom and less confusion than\nperhaps we do. It would possibly be thought a bold paradox, if not a\nvery dangerous falsehood, if I should say that some CHANGELINGS, who\nhave lived forty years together, without any appearance of reason, are\nsomething between a man and a beast: which prejudice is founded upon\nnothing else but a false supposition, that these two names, man and\nbeast, stand for distinct species so set out by real essences, that\nthere can come no other species between them: whereas if we will\nabstract from those names, and the supposition of such specific essences\nmade by nature, wherein all things of the same denominations did exactly\nand equally partake; if we would not fancy that there were a certain\nnumber of these essences, wherein all things, as in moulds, were cast\nand formed; we should find that the idea of the shape, motion, and life\nof a man without reason, is as much a distinct idea, and makes as much a\ndistinct sort of things from man and beast, as the idea of the shape of\nan ass with reason would be different from either that of man or beast,\nand be a species of an animal between, or distinct from both.\n14. Objection against a Changeling being something between a Man and\nBeast, answered.\nHere everybody will be ready to ask, If changelings may be supposed\nsomething between man and beast, pray what are they? I answer,\nCHANGELINGS; which is as good a word to signify something different from\nthe signification of MAN or BEAST, as the names man and beast are to\nhave significations different one from the other. This, well considered,\nwould resolve this matter, and show my meaning without any more ado. But\nI am not so unacquainted with the zeal of some men, which enables them\nto spin consequences, and to see religion threatened, whenever any one\nventures to quit their forms of speaking, as not to foresee what names\nsuch a proposition as this is like to be charged with: and without doubt\nit will be asked, If changelings are something between man and beast,\nwhat will become of them in the other world? To which I answer, I. It\nconcerns me not to know or inquire. To their own master they stand or\nfall. It will make their state neither better nor worse, whether we\ndetermine anything of it or no. They are in the hands of a faithful\nCreator and a bountiful Father, who disposes not of his creatures\naccording to our narrow thoughts or opinions, nor distinguishes them\naccording to names and species of our contrivance. And we that know so\nlittle of this present world we are in, may, I think, content ourselves\nwithout being peremptory in defining the different states which\ncreatures shall come into when they go off this stage. It may suffice\nus, that He hath made known to all those who are capable of instruction,\ndiscoursing, and reasoning, that they shall come to an account, and\nreceive according to what they have done in this body.\n15. What will become of Changelings in a future state?\nBut, Secondly, I answer, The force of these men's question (viz. Will\nyou deprive changelings of a future state?) is founded on one of these\ntwo suppositions, which are both false. The first is, That all things\nthat have the outward shape and appearance of a man must necessarily be\ndesigned to an immortal future being after this life: or, secondly, That\nwhatever is of human birth must be so. Take away these imaginations, and\nsuch questions will be groundless and ridiculous. I desire then those\nwho think there is no more but an accidental difference between\nthemselves and changelings, the essence in both being exactly the same,\nto consider, whether they can imagine immortality annexed to any outward\nshape of the body; the very proposing it is, I suppose, enough to make\nthem disown it. No one yet, that ever I heard of, how much soever\nimmersed in matter, allowed that excellency to any figure of the gross\nsensible outward consequence of it; or that any mass of matter\nshould, after its dissolution here, be again restored hereafter to an\neverlasting state of sense, perception, and knowledge, only because it\nwas moulded into this or that figure, and had such a particular frame\nof its visible parts. Such an opinion as this, placing immortality in a\ncertain superficial figure, turns out of doors all consideration of soul\nor spirit; upon whose account alone some corporeal beings have hitherto\nbeen concluded immortal, and others not. This is to attribute more to\nthe outside than inside of things; and to place the excellency of a man\nmore in the external shape of his body, than internal perfections of his\nsoul: which is but little better than to annex the great and inestimable\nadvantage of immortality and life everlasting, which he has above other\nmaterial beings, to annex it, I say, to the cut of his beard, or the\nfashion of his coat. For this or that outward mark of our bodies no more\ncarries with it the hope of an eternal duration, than the fashion of a\nman's suit gives him reasonable grounds to imagine it will never wear\nout, or that it will make him immortal. It will perhaps be said, that\nnobody thinks that the shape makes anything immortal, but it is the\nshape that is the sign of a rational soul within, which is immortal. I\nwonder who made it the sign of any such thing: for barely saying it,\nwill not make it so. It would require some proofs to persuade one of it.\nNo figure that I know speaks any such language. For it may as rationally\nbe concluded, that the dead body of a man, wherein there is to be found\nno more appearance or action of life than there is in a statue, has yet\nnevertheless a living soul in it, because of its shape; as that there\nis a rational soul in a changeling, because he has the outside of a\nrational creature, when his actions carry far less marks of reason with\nthem, in the whole course of his life than what are to be found in many\na beast.\n16. Monsters\nBut it is the issue of rational parents, and must therefore be concluded\nto have a rational soul. I know not by what logic you must so conclude.\nI am sure this is a conclusion that men nowhere allow of. For if they\ndid, they would not make bold, as everywhere they do to destroy\nill-formed and mis-shaped productions. Ay, but these are MONSTERS.\nLet them be so: what will your drivelling, unintelligent, intractable\nchangeling be? Shall a defect in the body make a monster; a defect in\nthe mind (the far more noble, and, in the common phrase, the far more\nessential part) not? Shall the want of a nose, or a neck, make a\nmonster, and put such issue out of the rank of men; the want of reason\nand understanding, not? This is to bring all back again to what was\nexploded just now: this is to place all in the shape, and to take the\nmeasure of a man only by his outside. To show that according to the\nordinary way of reasoning in this matter, people do lay the whole stress\non the figure, and resolve the whole essence of the species of man (as\nthey make it) into the outward shape, how unreasonable soever it be, and\nhow much soever they disown it, we need but trace their thoughts\nand practice a little further, and then it will plainly appear. The\nwell-shaped changeling is a man, has a rational soul, though it appear\nnot: this is past doubt, say you: make the ears a little longer, and\nmore pointed, and the nose a little flatter than ordinary, and then you\nbegin to boggle: make the face yet narrower, flatter, and longer, and\nthen you are at a stand: add still more and more of the likeness of a\nbrute to it, and let the head be perfectly that of some other animal,\nthen presently it is a monster; and it is demonstration with you that it\nhath no rational soul, and must be destroyed. Where now (I ask) shall be\nthe just measure; which the utmost bounds of that shape, that carries\nwith it a rational soul? For, since there have been human foetuses\nproduced, half beast and half man; and others three parts one, and one\npart the other; and so it is possible they may be in all the variety of\napproaches to the one or the other shape, and may have several degrees\nof mixture of the likeness of a man, or a brute;--I would gladly know\nwhat are those precise lineaments, which, according to this hypothesis,\nare or are not capable of a rational soul to be joined to them. What\nsort of outside is the certain sign that there is or is not such an\ninhabitant within? For till that be done, we talk at random of MAN: and\nshall always, I fear, do so, as long as we give ourselves up to certain\nsounds, and the imaginations of settled and fixed species in nature, we\nknow not what. But, after all, I desire it may be considered, that those\nwho think they have answered the difficulty, by telling us, that a\nmis-shaped foetus is a MONSTER, run into the same fault they are arguing\nagainst; by constituting a species between man and beast. For what else,\nI pray, is their monster in the case, (if the word monster signifies\nanything at all,) but something neither man nor beast, but partaking\nsomewhat of either? And just so is the CHANGELING before mentioned. So\nnecessary is it to quit the common notion of species and essences, if we\nwill truly look into the nature of things, and examine them by what our\nfaculties can discover in them as they exist, and not by groundless\nfancies that have been taken up about them.\n17. Words and Species.\nI have mentioned this here, because I think we cannot be too cautious\nthat words and species, in the ordinary notions which we have been used\nto of them, impose not on us. For I am apt to think therein lies one\ngreat obstacle to our clear and distinct knowledge, especially in\nreference to substances: and from thence has rose a great part of the\ndifficulties about truth and certainty. Would we accustom ourselves to\nseparate our contemplations and reasonings from words, we might in a\ngreat measure remedy this inconvenience within our own thoughts: but yet\nit would still disturb us in our discourse with others, as long as we\nretained the opinion, that SPECIES and their ESSENCES were anything else\nbut our abstract ideas (such as they are) with names annexed to them, to\nbe the signs of them.\n18. Recapitulation.\nWherever we perceive the agreement or disagreement of any of our ideas,\nthere is certain knowledge: and wherever we are sure those ideas agree\nwith the reality of things, there is certain real knowledge. Of which\nagreement of our ideas with the reality of things, having here given\nthe marks, I think, I have shown WHEREIN IT IS THAT CERTAINTY, REAL\nCERTAINTY, CONSISTS. Which, whatever it was to others, was, I confess,\nto me heretofore, one of those desiderata which I found great want of.\nCHAPTER V. OF TRUTH IN GENERAL.\n1. What Truth is.\nWHAT is truth? was an inquiry many ages since; and it being that which\nall mankind either do, or pretend to search after, it cannot but be\nworth our while carefully to examine wherein it consists; and so\nacquaint ourselves with the nature of it, as to observe how the mind\ndistinguishes it from falsehood.\n2. A right joining or separating of signs, i.e. either Ideas or Words.\nTruth, then, seems to me, in the proper import of the word, to signify\nnothing but THE JOINING OR SEPERATING OF SIGNS, AS THE THINGS SIGNIFIED\nBY THEM DO AGREE OR DISAGREE ONE WITH ANOTHER. The joining or separating\nof signs here meant, is what by another name we call PROPOSITION. So\nthat truth properly belongs only to propositions: whereof there are two\nsorts, viz. mental and verbal; as there are two sorts of signs commonly\nmade use of, viz. ideas and words.\n3. Which make mental or verbal Propositions.\nTo form a clear notion of truth, it is very necessary to consider truth\nof thought, and truth of words, distinctly one from another: but yet it\nis very difficult to treat of them asunder. Because it is unavoidable,\nin treating of mental propositions, to make use of words: and then the\ninstances given of mental propositions cease immediately to be barely\nmental, and become verbal. For a MENTAL PROPOSITION being nothing but a\nbare consideration of the ideas, as they are in our minds, stripped of\nnames, they lose the nature of purely mental propositions as soon as\nthey are put into words.\n4. Mental Propositions are very hard to be treated of.\nAnd that which makes it yet harder to treat of mental and verbal\npropositions separately is, that most men, if not all, in their thinking\nand reasonings within themselves, make use of words instead of ideas; at\nleast when the subject of their meditation contains in it complex ideas.\nWhich is a great evidence of the imperfection and uncertainty of our\nideas of that kind, and may, if attentively made use of, serve for\na mark to show us what are those things we have clear and perfect\nestablished ideas of, and what not. For if we will curiously observe the\nway our mind takes in thinking and reasoning, we shall find, I suppose,\nthat when we make any propositions within our own thoughts about WHITE\nor BLACK, SWEET or BITTER, a TRIANGLE or a CIRCLE, we can and often\ndo frame in our minds the ideas themselves, without reflecting on the\nnames. But when we would consider, or make propositions about the more\ncomplex ideas, as of a MAN, VITRIOL, FORTITUDE, GLORY, we usually put\nthe name for the idea: because the ideas these names stand for, being\nfor the most part imperfect, confused, and undetermined, we reflect\non the names themselves, because they are more clear, certain, and\ndistinct, and readier occur to our thoughts than the pure ideas: and so\nwe make use of these words instead of the ideas themselves, even when\nwe would meditate and reason within ourselves, and make tacit mental\npropositions. In substances, as has been already noticed, this is\noccasioned by the imperfections of our ideas: we making the name stand\nfor the real essence, of which we have no idea at all. In modes, it is\noccasioned by the great number of simple ideas that go to the making\nthem up. For many of them being compounded, the name occurs much easier\nthan the complex idea itself, which requires time and attention to be\nrecollected, and exactly represented to the mind, even in those men who\nhave formerly been at the pains to do it; and is utterly impossible\nto be done by those who, though they have ready in their memory the\ngreatest part of the common words of that language, yet perhaps never\ntroubled themselves in all their lives to consider what precise ideas\nthe most of them stood for. Some confused or obscure notions have served\ntheir turns; and many who talk very much of RELIGION and CONSCIENCE,\nof CHURCH and FAITH, of POWER and RIGHT, of OBSTRUCTIONS and HUMOURS,\nMELANCHOLY and CHOLER, would perhaps have little left in their thoughts\nand meditations, if one should desire them to think only of the things\nthemselves, and lay by those words with which they so often confound\nothers, and not seldom themselves also.\n5. Mental and Verbal Propositions contrasted.\nBut to return to the consideration of truth: we must, I say, observe two\nsorts of propositions that we are capable of making:--\nFirst, MENTAL, wherein the ideas in our understandings are without the\nuse of words put together, or separated, by the mind perceiving or\njudging of their agreement or disagreement.\nSecondly, VERBAL propositions, which are words, the signs of our ideas,\nput together or separated in affirmative or negative sentences. By which\nway of affirming or denying, these signs, made by sounds, are, as it\nwere, put together or separated from another. So that proposition\nconsists in joining or separating signs; and truth consists in the\nputting together or separating those signs, according as the things\nwhich they stand for agree or disagree.\n6. When Mental Propositions contain real Truth, and when Verbal.\nEvery one's experience will satisfy him, that the mind, either by\nperceiving, or supposing, the agreement or disagreement of any of its\nideas, does tacitly within itself put them into a kind of proposition\naffirmative or negative; which I have endeavoured to express by the\nterms putting together and separating. But this action of the mind,\nwhich is so familiar to every thinking and reasoning man, is easier to\nbe conceived by reflecting on what passes in us when we affirm or deny,\nthan to be explained by words. When a man has in his head the idea of\ntwo lines, viz. the side and diagonal of a square, whereof the diagonal\nis an inch long, he may have the idea also of the division of that line\ninto a certain number of equal parts; v.g. into five, ten, a hundred, a\nthousand, or any other number, and may have the idea of that inch line\nbeing divisible, or not divisible, into such equal parts, as a certain\nnumber of them will be equal to the sideline. Now, whenever he\nperceives, believes, or supposes such a kind of divisibility to agree or\ndisagree to his idea of that line, he, as it were, joins or separates\nthose two ideas, viz. the idea of that line, and the idea of that kind\nof divisibility; and so makes a mental proposition, which is true or\nfalse, according as such a kind of divisibility, a divisibility into\nsuch ALIQUOT parts, does really agree to that line or no. When ideas are\nso put together, or separated in the mind, as they or the things they\nstand for do agree or not, that is, as I may call it, MENTAL TRUTH. But\nTRUTH OF WORDS is something more; and that is the affirming or denying\nof words one of another, as the ideas they stand for agree or disagree:\nand this again is two-fold; either purely verbal and trifling, which I\nshall speak of, (chap. viii.,) or real and instructive; which is the\nobject of that real knowledge which we have spoken of already.\n7. Objection against verbal Truth, that thus it may all be chimerical.\nBut here again will be apt to occur the same doubt about truth, that did\nabout knowledge: and it will be objected, that if truth be nothing but\nthe joining and separating of words in propositions, as the ideas they\nstand for agree or disagree in men's minds, the knowledge of truth is\nnot so valuable a thing as it is taken to be, nor worth the pains and\ntime men employ in the search of it: since by this account it amounts to\nno more than the conformity of words to the chimeras of men's brains.\nWho knows not what odd notions many men's heads are filled with, and\nwhat strange ideas all men's brains are capable of? But if we rest here,\nwe know the truth of nothing by this rule, but of the visionary words in\nour own imaginations; nor have other truth, but what as much concerns\nharpies and centaurs, as men and horses. For those, and the like, may be\nideas in our heads, and have their agreement or disagreement there, as\nwell as the ideas of real beings, and so have as true propositions made\nabout them. And it will be altogether as true a proposition to say ALL\nCENTAURS ARE ANIMALS, as that ALL MEN ARE ANIMALS; and the certainty of\none as great as the other. For in both the propositions, the words are\nput together according to the agreement of the ideas in our minds: and\nthe agreement of the idea of animal with that of centaur is as clear and\nvisable to the mind, as the agreement of the idea of animal with that of\nman; and so these two propositions are equally true, equally certain.\nBut of what use is all such truth to us?\n8. Answered, Real Truth is about Ideas agreeing to things.\nThough what has been said in the foregoing chapter to distinguish real\nfrom imaginary knowledge might suffice here, in answer to this doubt,\nto distinguish real truth from chimerical, or (if you please) barely\nnominal, they depending both on the same foundation; yet it may not be\namiss here again to consider, that though our words signify things, the\ntruth they contain when put into propositions will be only verbal, when\nthey stand for ideas in the mind that have not an agreement with the\nreality of things. And therefore truth as well as knowledge may well\ncome under the distinction of verbal and real; that being only\nverbal truth, wherein terms are joined according to the agreement or\ndisagreement of the ideas they stand for; without regarding whether our\nideas are such as really have, or are capable of having, an existence\nin nature. But then it is they contain REAL TRUTH, when these signs are\njoined, as our ideas agree; and when our ideas are such as we know are\ncapable of having an existence in nature: which in substances we cannot\nknow, but by knowing that such have existed.\n9. Truth and Falsehood in general.\nTruth is the marking down in words the agreement or disagreement of\nideas as it is. Falsehood is the marking down in words the agreement or\ndisagreement of ideas otherwise than it is. And so far as these ideas,\nthus marked by sounds, agree to their archetypes, so far only is the\ntruth real. The knowledge of this truth consists in knowing what ideas\nthe words stand for, and the perception of the agreement or disagreement\nof those ideas, according as it is marked by those words.\n10. General Propositions to be treated of more at large.\nBut because words are looked on as the great conduits of truth and\nknowledge, and that in conveying and receiving of truth, and commonly in\nreasoning about it, we make use of words and propositions, I shall more\nat large inquire wherein the certainty of real truths contained in\npropositions consists, and where it is to be had; and endeavour to show\nin what sort of universal propositions we are capable of being certain\nof their real truth or falsehood.\nI shall begin with GENERAL propositions, as those which most employ our\nthoughts, and exercise our contemplation. General truths are most looked\nafter by the mind as those that most enlarge our knowledge; and by their\ncomprehensiveness satisfying us at once of many particulars, enlarge our\nview, and shorten our way to knowledge.\n11. Moral and Metaphysical Truth.\nBesides truth taken in the strict sense before mentioned, there are\nother sorts of truths: As, 1. Moral truth, which is speaking of things\naccording to the persuasion of our own minds, though the proposition we\nspeak agree not to the reality of things; 2. Metaphysical truth, which\nis nothing but the real existence of things, conformable to the ideas to\nwhich we have annexed their names. This, though it seems to consist in\nthe very beings of things, yet, when considered a little nearly, will\nappear to include a tacit proposition, whereby the mind joins that\nparticular thing to the idea it had before settled with the name to\nit. But these considerations of truth, either having been before taken\nnotice of, or not being much to our present purpose, it may suffice here\nonly to have mentioned them.\nCHAPTER VI. OF UNIVERSAL PROPOSITIONS: THEIR TRUTH AND CERTAINTY.\n1. Treating of Words necessary to Knowledge.\nTHOUGH the examining and judging of ideas by themselves, their names\nbeing quite laid aside, be the best and surest way to clear and distinct\nknowledge: yet, through the prevailing custom of using sounds for ideas,\nI think it is very seldom practised. Every one may observe how common it\nis for names to be made use of, instead of the ideas themselves, even\nwhen men think and reason within their own breasts; especially if the\nideas be very complex, and made up of a great collection of simple ones.\nThis makes the consideration of WORDS and PROPOSITIONS so necessary\na part of the Treatise of Knowledge, that it is very hard to speak\nintelligibly of the one, without explaining the other.\n2. General Truths hardly to be understood, but in verbal Propositions.\nAll the knowledge we have, being only of particular or general truths,\nit is evident that whatever may be done in the former of these, the\nlatter, which is that which with reason is most sought after, can never\nbe well made known, and is very seldom apprehended, but as conceived\nand expressed in words. It is not, therefore, out of our way, in the\nexamination of our knowledge, to inquire into the truth and certainty of\nuniversal propositions.\n3. Certainty twofold--of Truth and of Knowledge.\nBut that we may not be misled in this case by that which is the danger\neverywhere, I mean by the doubtfulness of terms, it is fit to observe\nthat certainty is twofold: CERTAINTY OF TRUTH and CERTAINTY OF\nKNOWLEDGE. Certainty of truth is, when words are so put together in\npropositions as exactly to express the agreement or disagreement of the\nideas they stand for, as really it is. Certainty of knowledge is to\nperceive the agreement or disagreement of ideas, as expressed in any\nproposition. This we usually call knowing, or being certain of the truth\nof any proposition.\n4. No Proposition can be certainly known to be true, where the real\nEssence of each Species mentioned is not known.\nNow, because we cannot be certain of the truth of any general\nproposition, unless we know the precise bounds and extent of the species\nits terms stand for, it is necessary we should know the essence of each\nspecies, which is that which constitutes and bounds it.\nThis, in all simple ideas and modes, is not hard to do. For in these\nthe real and nominal essence being the same, or, which is all one, the\nabstract idea which the general term stands for being the sole essence\nand boundary that is or can be supposed of the species, there can be no\ndoubt how far the species extends, or what things are comprehended under\neach term; which, it is evident, are all that have an exact conformity\nwith the idea it stands for, and no other. But in substances, wherein\na real essence, distinct from the nominal, is supposed to constitute,\ndetermine, and bound the species, the extent of the general word is very\nuncertain; because, not knowing this real essence, we cannot know what\nis, or what is not of that species; and, consequently, what may or may\nnot with certainty be affirmed of it. And thus, speaking of a MAN,\nor GOLD, or any other species of natural substances, as supposed\nconstituted by a precise and real essence which nature regularly imparts\nto every individual of that kind, whereby it is made to be of that\nspecies, we cannot be certain of the truth of any affirmation or\nnegation made of it. For man or gold, taken in this sense, and used\nfor species of things constituted by real essences, different from the\ncomplex idea in the mind of the speaker, stand for we know not what; and\nthe extent of these species, with such boundaries, are so unknown and\nundetermined, that it is impossible with any certainty to affirm, that\nall men are rational, or that all gold is yellow. But where the nominal\nessence is kept to, as the boundary of each species, and men extend the\napplication of any general term no further than to the particular things\nin which the complex idea it stands for is to be found, there they are\nin no danger to mistake the bounds of each species, nor can be in doubt,\non this account, whether any proposition be true or not. I have chosen\nto explain this uncertainty of propositions in this scholastic way, and\nhave made use of the terms of ESSENCES, and SPECIES, on purpose to show\nthe absurdity and inconvenience there is to think of them as of any\nother sort of realities, than barely abstract ideas with names to them.\nTo suppose that the species of things are anything but the sorting of\nthem under general names, according as they agree to several abstract\nideas of which we make those names signs, is to confound truth, and\nintroduce uncertainty into all general propositions that can be made\nabout them. Though therefore these things might, to people not possessed\nwith scholastic learning, be treated of in a better and clearer way\nyet those wrong notions of essences or species having got root in most\npeople's minds who have received any tincture from the learning which\nhas prevailed in this part of the world, are to be discovered and\nremoved, to make way for that use of words which should convey certainty\nwith it.\n5. This more particularly concerns Substances.\nThe names of substances, then, whenever made to stand for species which\nare supposed to be constituted by real essences which we know not, are\nnot capable to convey certainty to the understanding. Of the truth\ngeneral propositions made up of such terms we cannot be sure. [The\nreason whereof is plain: for how can we be sure that this or that\nquality is in gold, when we know not what is or is not gold? Since in\nthis way of speaking, nothing is gold but what partakes of an essence,\nwhich we, not knowing, cannot know where it is or is not, and so cannot\nbe sure that any parcel of matter in the world is or is not in this\nsense gold; being incurably ignorant whether IT has or has not that\nwhich makes anything to be called gold; i. e. that real essence of gold\nwhereof we have no idea at all. This being as impossible for us to know\nas it is for a blind man to tell in what flower the colour of a pansy is\nor is not to be found, whilst he has no idea of the colour of a pansy at\nall. Or if we could (which is impossible) certainly know where a real\nessence, which we know not, is, v.g. in what parcels of matter the real\nessence of gold is, yet could we not be sure that this or that quality\ncould with truth be affirmed of gold; since it is impossible for us to\nknow that this or that quality or idea has a necessary connexion with\na real essence of which we have no idea at all, whatever species that\nsupposed real essence may be imagined to constitute.]\n6.\nOn the other side, the names of substances, when made use of as they\nshould be, for the ideas men have in their minds, though they carry a\nclear and determinate signification with them, will not yet serve us to\nmake many universal propositions of whose truth we can be certain. Not\nbecause in this use of them we are uncertain what things are signified\nby them, but because the complex ideas they stand for are such\ncombinations of simple ones as carry not with them any discoverable\nconnexion or repugnancy, but with a very few other ideas.\n7.\nThe complex ideas that our names of the species of substances properly\nstand for, are collections of such qualities as have been observed to\nco-exist in an unknown substratum, which we call substance; but what\nother qualities necessarily co-exist with such combinations, we cannot\ncertainly know, unless we can discover their natural dependence; which,\nin their primary qualities, we can go but a very little way in; and in\nall their secondary qualities we can discover no connexion at all: for\nthe reasons mentioned, chap. iii. Viz. 1. Because we know not the\nreal constitutions of substances, on which each secondary quality\nparticularly depends. 2. Did we know that, it would serve us only for\nexperimental (not universal) knowledge; and reach with certainty no\nfurther than that bare instance: because our understandings can\ndiscover no conceivable connexion between any secondary quality and any\nmodification whatsoever of any of the primary ones. And therefore there\nare very few general propositions to be made concerning substances,\nwhich can carry with them undoubted certainty.\n8. Instance in Gold.\n'All gold is fixed,' is a proposition whose truth we cannot be certain\nof, how universally soever it be believed. For if, according to the\nuseless imagination of the Schools, any one supposes the term gold to\nstand for a species of things set out by nature, by a real essence\nbelonging to it, it is evident he knows not what particular substances\nare of that species; and so cannot with certainty affirm anything\nuniversally of gold. But if he makes gold stand for a species determined\nby its nominal essence, let the nominal essence, for example, be the\ncomplex idea of a body of a certain yellow colour, malleable, fusible,\nand heavier than any other known;--in this proper use of the word gold,\nthere is no difficulty to know what is or is not gold. But yet no other\nquality can with certainty be universally affirmed or denied of gold,\nbut what hath a DISCOVERABLE connexion or inconsistency with that\nnominal essence. Fixedness, for example, having no necessary connexion\nthat we can discover, with the colour, weight, or any other simple\nidea of our complex one, or with the whole combination together; it is\nimpossible that we should certainly know the truth of this proposition,\nthat all gold is fixed.\n9. No discoverable necessary connexion between nominal essence gold, and\nother simple ideas.\nAs there is no discoverable connexion between fixedness and the colour,\nweight, and other simple ideas of that nominal essence of gold; so,\nif we make our complex idea of gold, a body yellow, fusable, ductile,\nweighty, and fixed, we shall be at the same uncertainty concerning\nsolubility in AQUA REGIA, and for the same reason. Since we can never,\nfrom consideration of the ideas themselves, with certainty affirm or\ndeny of a body whose complex idea is made up of yellow, very weighty,\nductile, fusible, and fixed, that it is soluble in AQUA REGIA: and so\non of the rest of its qualities. I would gladly meet with one general\naffirmation concerning any will, no doubt, be presently objected, Is not\nthis an universal proposition, ALL GOLD IS MALLEABLE? To which I answer,\nIt is a very complex idea the word gold stands for. But then here is\nnothing affirmed of gold, but that that sound stands for an idea in\nwhich malleableness is contained: and such a sort of truth and certainty\nas this it is, to say a centaur is four-footed. But if malleableness make\nnot a part of the specific essence the name of gold stands for, it is\nplain, ALL GOLD IS MALLEABLE, is not a certain proposition. Because,\nlet the complex idea of gold be made up of whichsoever of its other\nqualities you please, malleableness will not appear to depend on that\ncomplex idea, nor follow from any simple one contained in it: the\nconnexion that malleableness has (if it has any) with those other\nqualities being only by the intervention of the real constitution of its\ninsensible parts; which, since we know not, it is impossible we should\nperceive that connexion, unless we could discover that which ties them\ntogether.\n10. As far as any such Co-existence can be known, so far Universal\nPropositions maybe certain. But this will go but a little way.\nThe more, indeed, of these co-existing qualities we unite into one\ncomplex idea, under one name, the more precise and determinate we make\nthe signification of that word; but never yet make it thereby more\ncapable of universal certainty, IN RESPECT OF OTHER QUALITIES NOT\nCONTAINED IN OUR COMPLEX IDEA: since we perceive not their connexion or\ndependence on one another; being ignorant both of that real constitution\nin which they are all founded, and also how they flow from it. For the\nchief part of our knowledge concerning substances is not, as in other\nthings, barely of the relation of two ideas that may exist separately;\nbut is of the necessary connexion and co-existence of several distinct\nideas in the same subject, or of their repugnancy so to co-exist. Could\nwe begin at the other end, and discover what it was wherein that colour\nconsisted, what made a body lighter or heavier, what texture of parts\nmade it malleable, fusible, and fixed, and fit to be dissolved in this\nsort of liquor, and not in another;--if, I say, we had such an idea\nas this of bodies, and could perceive wherein all sensible qualities\noriginally consist, and how they are produced; we might frame such\nabstract ideas of them as would furnish us with matter of more general\nknowledge, and enable us to make universal propositions, that should\ncarry general truth and certainty with them. But whilst our complex\nideas of the sorts of substances are so remote from that internal real\nconstitution on which their sensible qualities depend, and are made up\nof nothing but an imperfect collection of those apparent qualities our\nsenses can discover, there can be few general propositions concerning\nsubstances of whose real truth we can be certainly assured; since there\nare but few simple ideas of whose connexion and necessary co-existence\nwe can have certain and undoubted knowledge. I imagine, amongst all the\nsecondary qualities of substances, and the powers relating to them,\nthere cannot any two be named, whose necessary co-existence, or\nrepugnance to co-exist, can certainly be known; unless in those of the\nsame sense, which necessarily exclude one another, as I have elsewhere\nshowed. No one, I think, by the colour that is in any body, can\ncertainly know what smell, taste, sound, or tangible qualities it has,\nnor what alterations it is capable to make or receive on or from other\nbodies. The same may be said of the sound or taste, &c. Our specific\nnames of substances standing for any collections of such ideas, it\nis not to be wondered that we can with them make very few general\npropositions of undoubted real certainty. But yet so far as any complex\nidea of any sort of substances contains in it any simple idea, whose\nNECESSARY co-existence with any other MAY be discovered, so far\nuniversal propositions may with certainty be made concerning it: v.g.\ncould any one discover a necessary connexion between malleableness and\nthe colour or weight of gold, or any other part of the complex idea\nsignified by that name, he might make a certain universal proposition\nconcerning gold in this respect; and the real truth of this proposition,\nthat ALL GOLD IS MALLIABLE, would be as certain as of this, THE THREE\nANGLES OF ALL RIGHT-LINED TRIANGLES ARE ALL EQUAL TO TWO RIGHT ONES.\n11. The Qualities which make our complex Ideas of Substances depend\nmostly on external, remote, and unperceived Causes.\nHad we such ideas of substances as to know what real constitutions\nproduce those sensible qualities we find in them, and how those\nqualities flowed from thence, we could, by the specific ideas of\ntheir real essences in our own minds, more certainly find out their\nproperties, and discover what qualities they had or had not, than we can\nnow by our senses: and to know the properties of gold, it would be\nno more necessary that gold should exist, and that we should make\nexperiments upon it, than it is necessary for the knowing the properties\nof a triangle, that a triangle should exist in any matter, the idea in\nour minds would serve for the one as well as the other. But we are so\nfar from being admitted into the secrets of nature, that we scarce so\nmuch as ever approach the first entrance towards them. For we are wont\nto consider the substances we meet with, each of them, as an entire\nthing by itself, having all its qualities in itself, and independent of\nother things; overlooking, for the most part, the operations of those\ninvisible fluids they are encompassed with, and upon whose motions and\noperations depend the greatest part of those qualities which are taken\nnotice of in them, and are made by us the inherent marks of distinction\nwhereby we know and denominate them. Put a piece of gold anywhere by\nitself, separate from the reach and influence of all other bodies,\nit will immediately lose all its colour and weight, and perhaps\nmalleableness too; which, for aught I know, would be changed into a\nperfect friability. Water, in which to us fluidity is an essential\nquality, left to itself, would cease to be fluid. But if inanimate\nbodies owe so much of their present state to other bodies without them,\nthat they would not be what they appear to us were those bodies that\nenviron them removed; it is yet more so in vegetables, which are\nnourished, grow, and produce leaves, flowers, and seeds, in a constant\nsuccession. And if we look a little nearer into the state of animals,\nwe shall find that their dependence, as to life, motion, and the\nmost considerable qualities to be observed in them, is so wholly on\nextrinsical causes and qualities of other bodies that make no part of\nthem, that they cannot subsist a moment without them: though yet those\nbodies on which they depend are little taken notice of, and make no part\nof the complex ideas we frame of those animals. Take the air but for a\nminute from the greatest part of living creatures, and they presently\nlose sense, life, and motion. This the necessity of breathing has forced\ninto our knowledge. But how many other extrinsical and possibly very\nremote bodies do the springs of these admirable machines depend on,\nwhich are not vulgarly observed, or so much as thought on; and how many\nare there which the severest inquiry can never discover? The inhabitants\nof this spot of the universe, though removed so many millions of\nmiles from the sun, yet depend so much on the duly tempered motion of\nparticles coming from or agitated by it, that were this earth removed\nbut a small part of the distance out of its present situation, and\nplaced a little further or nearer that source of heat, it is more than\nprobable that the greatest part of the animals in it would immediately\nperish: since we find them so often destroyed by an excess or defect of\nthe sun's warmth, which an accidental position in some parts of this our\nlittle globe exposes them to. The qualities observed in a loadstone must\nneeds have their source far beyond the confines of that body; and the\nravage made often on several sorts of animals by invisible causes, the\ncertain death (as we are told) of some of them, by barely passing\nthe line, or, as it is certain of other, by being removed into a\nneighbouring country; evidently show that the concurrence and operations\nof several bodies, with which they are seldom thought to have anything\nto do, is absolutely necessary to make them be what they appear to us,\nand to preserve those qualities by which we know and distinguish them.\nWe are then quite out of the way, when we think that things contain\nWITHIN THEMSELVES the qualities that appear to us in them; and we\nin vain search for that constitution within the body of a fly or an\nelephant, upon which depend those qualities and powers we observe in\nthem. For which, perhaps, to understand them aright, we ought to look\nnot only beyond this our earth and atmosphere, but even beyond the sun\nor remotest star our eyes have yet discovered. For how much the being\nand operation of particular substances in this our globe depends on\ncauses utterly beyond our view, is impossible for us to determine. We\nsee and perceive some of the motions and grosser operations of things\nhere about us; but whence the streams come that keep all these curious\nmachines in motion and repair, how conveyed and modified, is beyond our\nnotice and apprehension: and the great parts and wheels, as I may so\nsay, of this stupendous structure of the universe, may, for aught we\nknow, have such a connexion and dependence in their influences and\noperations one upon another, that perhaps things in this our mansion\nwould put on quite another face, and cease to be what they are, if some\none of the stars or great bodies incomprehensibly remote from us,\nshould cease to be or move as it does. This is certain: things, however\nabsolute and entire they seem in themselves, are but retainers to other\nparts of nature, for that which they are most taken notice of by us.\nTheir observable qualities, actions, and powers are owing to something\nwithout them; and there is not so complete and perfect a part that we\nknow of nature, which does not owe the being it has, and the excellences\nof it, to its neighbours; and we must not confine our thoughts within\nthe surface of any body, but look a great deal further, to comprehend\nperfectly those qualities that are in it.\n12. Our nominal essences of Substances furnish few universal\npropositions about them that are certain.\nIf this be so, it is not to be wondered that we have very imperfect\nideas of substances, and that the real essences, on which depend their\nproperties and operations, are unknown to us. We cannot discover so much\nas that size, figure, and texture of their minute and active parts,\nwhich is really in much less the different motions and impulses made in\nand upon them by bodies from without, upon which depends, and by which\nis formed the greatest and most remarkable part of those qualities we\nobserve in them, and of which our complex ideas of them are made up.\nThis consideration alone is enough to put an end to all our hopes of\never having the ideas of their real essences; which whilst we want, the\nnominal essences we make use of instead of them will be able to\nfurnish us but very sparingly with any general knowledge, or universal\npropositions capable of real certainty.\n13. Judgment of Probability concerning Substances may reach further: but\nthat is not Knowledge.\nWe are not therefore to wonder, if certainty be to be found in very few\ngeneral propositions made concerning substances: our knowledge of their\nqualities and properties goes very seldom further than our senses reach\nand inform us. Possibly inquisitive and observing men may, by strength\nof judgment, penetrate further, and, on probabilities taken from wary\nobservation, and hints well laid together, often guess right at what\nexperience has not yet discovered to them. But this is but guessing\nstill; it amounts only to opinion, and has not that certainty which is\nrequisite to knowledge. For all general knowledge lies only in our own\nthoughts, and consists barely in the contemplation of our own abstract\nideas. Wherever we perceive any agreement or disagreement amongst them,\nthere we have general knowledge; and by putting the names of those ideas\ntogether accordingly in propositions, can with certainty pronounce\ngeneral truths. But because the abstract ideas of substances, for\nwhich their specific names stand, whenever they have any distinct\nand determinate signification, have a discoverable connexion or\ninconsistency with but a very few other ideas, the certainty of\nuniversal propositions concerning substances is very narrow and scanty,\nin that part which is our principal inquiry concerning them; and there\nare scarce any of the names of substances, let the idea it is applied\nto be what it will, of which we can generally, and with certainty,\npronounce, that it has or has not this or that other quality belonging\nto it, and constantly co-existing or inconsistent with that idea,\nwherever it is to be found.\n14. What is requisite for our Knowledge of Substances.\nBefore we can have any tolerable knowledge of this kind, we must First\nknow what changes the primary qualities of one body do regularly produce\nin the primary qualities of another, and how. Secondly, We must know\nwhat primary qualities of any body produce certain sensations or ideas\nin us. This is in truth no less than to know ALL the effects of matter,\nunder its divers modifications of bulk, figure, cohesion of parts,\nmotion and rest. Which, I think every body will allow, is utterly\nimpossible to be known by us without revelation. Nor if it were revealed\nto us what sort of figure, bulk, and motion of corpuscles would produce\nin us the sensation of a yellow colour, and what sort of figure, bulk,\nand texture of parts in the superficies of any body were fit to give\nsuch corpuscles their due motion to produce that colour; would that be\nenough to make universal propositions with certainty, concerning the\nseveral sorts of them; unless we had faculties acute enough to perceive\nthe precise bulk, figure, texture, and motion of bodies, in those minute\nparts, by which they operate on our senses, so that we might by those\nframe our abstract ideas of them. I have mentioned here only\ncorporeal substances, whose operations seem to lie more level to our\nunderstandings. For as to the operations of spirits, both their thinking\nand moving of bodies, we at first sight find ourselves at a loss; though\nperhaps, when we have applied our thoughts a little nearer to the\nconsideration of bodies and their operations, and examined how far our\nnotions, even in these, reach with any clearness beyond sensible matter\nof fact, we shall be bound to confess that, even in these too, our\ndiscoveries amount to very little beyond perfect ignorance and\nincapacity.\n15. Whilst our complex Ideas of Substances contain not ideas of their\nreal Constitutions, we can make but few general Propositions concerning\nthem.\nThis is evident, the abstract complex ideas of substances, for which\ntheir general names stand, not comprehending their real constitutions,\ncan afford us very little universal certainty. Because our ideas of them\nare not made up of that on which those qualities we observe in them, and\nwould inform ourselves about, do depend, or with which they have any\ncertain connexion: v.g. let the ideas to which we give the name MAN be,\nas it commonly is, a body of the ordinary shape, with sense, voluntary\nmotion, and reason joined to it. This being the abstract idea, and\nconsequently the essence of OUR species, man, we can make but very few\ngeneral certain propositions concerning man, standing for such an idea.\nBecause, not knowing the real constitution on which sensation, power of\nmotion, and reasoning, with that peculiar shape, depend, and whereby\nthey are united together in the same subject, there are very few other\nqualities with which we can perceive them to have a necessary connexion:\nand therefore we cannot with certainty affirm: That all men sleep by\nintervals; That no man can be nourished by wood or stones; That all men\nwill be poisoned by hemlock: because these ideas have no connexion nor\nrepugnancy with this our nominal essence of man, with this abstract idea\nthat name stands for. We must, in these and the like, appeal to trial in\nparticular subjects, which can reach but a little way. We must content\nourselves with probability in the rest: but can have no general\ncertainty, whilst our specific idea of man contains not that real\nconstitution which is the root wherein all his inseparable qualities are\nunited, and from whence they flow. Whilst our idea the word MAN stands\nfor is only an imperfect collection of some sensible qualities and\npowers in him, there is no discernible connexion or repugnance between\nour specific idea, and the operation of either the parts of hemlock or\nstones upon his constitution. There are animals that safely eat hemlock,\nand others that are nourished by wood and stones: but as long as we want\nideas of those real constitutions of different sorts of animals whereon\nthese and the like qualities and powers depend, we must not hope to\nreach certainty in universal propositions concerning them. Those few\nideas only which have a discernible connexion with our nominal essence,\nor any part of it, can afford us such propositions. But these are so\nfew, and of so little moment, that we may justly look on our certain\ngeneral knowledge of substances as almost none at all.\n16. Wherein lies the general Certainty of Propositions.\nTo conclude: general propositions, of what kind soever, are then only\ncapable of certainty, when the terms used in them stand for such ideas,\nwhose agreement or disagreement, as there expressed, is capable to be\ndiscovered by us. And we are then certain of their truth or falsehood,\nwhen we perceive the ideas the terms stand for to agree or not agree,\naccording as they are affirmed or denied one of another. Whence we may\ntake notice, that general certainty is never to be found but in\nour ideas. Whenever we go to seek it elsewhere, in experiment or\nobservations without us, our knowledge goes not beyond particulars. It\nis the contemplation of our own abstract ideas that alone is able to\nafford us general knowledge.\nCHAPTER VII. OF MAXIMS\n1. Maxims or Axioms are Self-evident Propositions.\nTHERE are a sort of propositions, which, under the name of MAXIMS and\nAXIOMS, have passed for principles of science: and because they are\nSELF-EVIDENT, have been supposed innate, without that anybody (that\nI know) ever went about to show the reason and foundation of their\nclearness or cogency. It may, however, be worth while to inquire into\nthe reason of their evidence, and see whether it be peculiar to them\nalone; and also to examine how far they influence and govern our other\nknowledge.\n2. Where in that Self-evidence consists.\nKnowledge, as has been shown, consists in the perception of the\nagreement or disagreement of ideas. Now, where that agreement\nor disagreement is perceived immediately by itself, without the\nintervention or help of any other, there our knowledge is self-evident.\nThis will appear to be so to any who will but consider any of those\npropositions which, without any proof, he assents to at first sight: for\nin all of them he will find that the reason of his assent is from that\nagreement or disagreement which the mind, by an immediate comparing\nthem, finds in those ideas answering the affirmation or negation in the\nproposition.\n3. Self evidence not peculiar to received Axioms.\nThis being so, in the next place, let us consider whether this\nself-evidence be peculiar only to those propositions which commonly pass\nunder the name of maxims, and have the dignity of axioms allowed them.\nAnd here it is plain, that several other truths, not allowed to be\naxioms, partake equally with them in this self-evidence. This we shall\nsee, if we go over these several sorts of agreement or disagreement\nof ideas which I have above mentioned, viz. identity, relation,\nco-existence, and real existence; which will discover to us, that not\nonly those few propositions which have had the credit of maxims are\nself-evident, but a great many, even almost an infinite number of other\npropositions are such.\n4. As to Identity and Diversity all Propositions are equally\nself-evident.\nI. For, FIRST, The immediate perception of the agreement or disagreement\nof IDENTITY being founded in the mind's having distinct ideas, this\naffords us as many self-evident propositions as we have distinct ideas.\nEvery one that has any knowledge at all, has, as the foundation of it,\nvarious and distinct ideas: and it is the first act of the mind (without\nwhich it can never be capable of any knowledge) to know every one of\nits ideas by itself, and distinguish it from others. Every one finds in\nhimself, that he knows the ideas he has; that he knows also, when any\none is in his understanding, and what it is; and that when more than one\nare there, he knows them distinctly and unconfusedly one from another;\nwhich always being so, (it being impossible but that he should perceive\nwhat he perceives,) he can never be in doubt when any idea is in his\nmind, that it is there, and is that idea it is; and that two distinct\nideas, when they are in his mind, are there, and are not one and the\nsame idea. So that all such affirmations and negations are made\nwithout any possibility of doubt, uncertainty, or hesitation, and must\nnecessarily be assented to as soon as understood; that is, as soon as we\nhave in our minds [determined ideas,] which the terms in the proposition\nstand for. [And, therefore, whenever the mind with attention considers\nany proposition, so as to perceive the two ideas signified by the terms,\nand affirmed or denied one of the other to be the same or different; it\nis presently and infallibly certain of the truth of such a proposition;\nand this equally whether these propositions be in terms standing for\nmore general ideas, or such as are less so: v.g. whether the general\nidea of Being be affirmed of itself, as in this proposition, 'whatsoever\nis, is'; or a more particular idea be affirmed of itself, as 'a man is a\nman'; or, 'whatsoever is white is white'; or whether the idea of being\nin general be denied of not-Being, which is the only (if I may so\ncall it) idea different from it, as in this other proposition, 'it is\nimpossible for the same thing to be and not to be': or any idea of any\nparticular being be denied of another different from it, as 'a man is\nnot a horse'; 'red is not blue.' The difference of the ideas, as soon as\nthe terms are understood, makes the truth of the proposition presently\nvisible, and that with an equal certainty and easiness in the less as\nwell as the more general propositions; and all for the same reason, viz.\nbecause the mind perceives, in any ideas that it has, the same idea to\nbe the same with itself; and two different ideas to be different, and\nnot the same; and this it is equally certain of, whether these ideas\nbe more or less general, abstract, and comprehensive.] It is not,\ntherefore, alone to these two general propositions--'whatsoever is, is';\nand 'it is impossible for the same thing to be and not to be'--that this\nsort of self-evidence belongs by any peculiar right. The perception of\nbeing, or not being, belongs no more to these vague ideas, signified by\nthe terms WHATSOEVER, and THING, than it does to any other ideas. [These\ntwo general maxims, amounting to no more, in short, but this, that THE\nSAME IS THE SAME, and THE SAME IS NOT DIFFERENT, are truths known in\nmore particular instances, as well as in those general maxims; and known\nalso in particular instances, before these general maxims are ever\nthought on; and draw all their force from the discernment of the mind\nemployed about particular ideas. There is nothing more visible than\nthat] the mind, without the help of any proof, [or reflection on either\nof these general propositions,] perceives so clearly, and knows so\ncertainly, that the idea of white is the idea of white, and not the idea\nof blue; and that the idea of white, when it is in the mind, is there,\nand is not absent; [that the consideration of these axioms can add\nnothing to the evidence or certainty of its knowledge.] [Just so it is\n(as every one may experiment in himself) in all the ideas a man has in\nhis mind: he knows each to be itself, and not to be another; and to be\nin his mind, and not away when it is there, with a certainty that cannot\nbe greater; and, therefore, the truth of no general proposition can be\nknown with a greater certainty, nor add anything to this.] So that,\nin respect of identity, our intuitive knowledge reaches as far as our\nideas. And we are capable of making as many self-evident propositions,\nas we have names for distinct ideas. And I appeal to every one's own\nmind, whether this proposition, 'a circle is a circle,' be not as\nself-evident a proposition as that consisting of more general terms,\n'whatsoever is, is'; and again, whether this proposition, 'blue is not\nred,' be not a proposition that the mind can no more doubt of, as\nsoon as it understands the words, than it does of that axiom, 'it is\nimpossible for the same thing to be and not to be?' And so of all the\nlike.\n5. In Co-existance we have few self-evident Propositions.\nII. SECONDLY, as to CO-EXISTANCE, or such a necessary connexion between\ntwo ideas that, in the subject where one of them is supposed, there the\nother must necessarily be also: of such agreement or disagreement as\nthis, the mind has an immediate perception but in very few of them. And\ntherefore in this sort we have but very little intuitive knowledge: nor\nare there to be found very many propositions that are self-evident,\nthough some there are: v.g. the idea of filling a place equal to the\ncontents of its superficies, being annexed to our idea of body, I think\nit is a self-evident proposition, that two bodies cannot be in the same\nplace.\n6. III. In other Relations we may have many.\nTHIRDLY, As to the RELATIONS OF MODES, mathematicians have framed many\naxioms concerning that one relation of equality. As, 'equals taken from\nequals, the remainder will be equal'; which, with the rest of that kind,\nhowever they are received for maxims by the mathematicians, and are\nunquestionable truths, yet, I think, that any one who considers them\nwill not find that they have a clearer self-evidence than these,--that\n'one and one are equal to two', that 'if you take from the five fingers\nof one hand two, and from the five fingers of the other hand two,\nthe remaining numbers will be equal.' These and a thousand other such\npropositions may be found in numbers, which, at the very first hearing,\nforce the assent, and carry with them an equal if not greater clearness,\nthan those mathematical axioms.\n7. IV. Concerning real Existence, we have none.\nFOURTHLY, as to REAL EXISTANCE, since that has no connexion with any\nother of our ideas, but that of ourselves, and of a First Being, we have\nin that, concerning the real existence of all other beings, not so much\nas demonstrative, much less a self-evident knowledge: and, therefore,\nconcerning those, there are no maxims.\n8. These Axioms do not much influence our other Knowledge.\nIn the next place let us consider, what influence these received maxims\nhave upon the other parts of our knowledge. The rules established in the\nschools, that all reasonings are EX PRAECOGNITIS ET PRAECONCESSIS, seem\nto lay the foundation of all other knowledge in these maxims, and to\nsuppose them to be PRAECOGNITA. Whereby, I think, are meant these two\nthings: first, that these axioms are those truths that are first known\nto the mind; and, secondly, that upon them the other parts of our\nknowledge depend.\n9. Because Maxims or Axioms are not the Truths we first knew.\nFIRST, That they are not the truths first known to the mind is evident\nto experience, as we have shown in another place. (Book I. chap, 1.) Who\nperceives not that a child certainly knows that a stranger is not its\nmother; that its sucking-bottle is not the rod, long before he knows\nthat 'it is impossible for the same thing to be and not to be?' And how\nmany truths are there about numbers, which it is obvious to observe that\nthe mind is perfectly acquainted with, and fully convinced of, before it\never thought on these general maxims, to which mathematicians, in their\narguings, do sometimes refer them? Whereof the reason is very plain: for\nthat which makes the mind assent to such propositions, being nothing\nelse but the perception it has of the agreement or disagreement of its\nideas, according as it finds them affirmed or denied one of another in\nwords it understands; and every idea being known to be what it is,\nand every two distinct ideas being known not to be the same; it must\nnecessarily follow that such self-evident truths must be first known\nwhich consist of ideas that are first in the mind. And the ideas first\nin the mind, it is evident, are those of particular things, from whence\nby slow degrees, the understanding proceeds to some few general ones;\nwhich being taken from the ordinary and familiar objects of sense, are\nsettled in the mind, with general names to them. Thus PARTICULAR IDEAS\nare first received and distinguished, and so knowledge got about them;\nand next to them, the less general or specific, which are next to\nparticular. For abstract ideas are not so obvious or easy to children,\nor the yet unexercised mind, as particular ones. If they seem so to\ngrown men, it is only because by constant and familiar use they are made\nso. For, when we nicely reflect upon them, we shall find that GENERAL\nIDEAS are fictions and contrivances of the mind, that carry difficulty\nwith them and do not so easily offer themselves as we are apt to\nimagine. For example, does it not require some pains and skill to form\nthe general idea of a triangle,(which is yet none of the more abstract,\ncomprehensive, and difficult,) for it must be neither oblique nor\nrectangle, neither equilateral, equicrural, nor scalinon; but all and\nnone of these at once. In effect, it is something imperfect, that cannot\nexist; an idea wherein some part of several different and inconsistant\nideas are put together. It is true, the mind, in this imperfect state,\nhas need of such ideas, and makes all the haste to them it can, for the\nconveniency of communication and enlargement of knowledge; to both which\nit is naturally very much inclined. But yet one has reason to suspect\nsuch ideas are marks of our imperfection; at least, this is enough to\nshow that the most abstract and general ideas are not those that the\nmind is first and most easily acquainted with, nor such as its earliest\nknowledge is conversant about.\n10. Because on perception of them the other Parts of our Knowledge do\nnot depend.\nSecondly, from what has been said it plainly follows, that these\nmagnified maxims are not the principles and foundations of all our other\nknowledge. For if there be a great many other truths, which have as much\nself-evidence as they, and a great many that we know before them, it is\nimpossible they should be the principles from which we deduce all other\ntruths. Is it impossible to know that one and two are equal to three,\nbut by virtue of this, or some such axiom, viz. 'the whole is equal to\nall its parts taken together?' Many a one knows that one and two are\nequal to three, without having heard, or thought on, that or any other\naxiom by which it might be proved; and knows it as certainly as any\nother man knows, that 'the whole is equal to all its parts,' or any\nother maxim; and all from the same reason of self-evidence: the equality\nof those ideas being as visible and certain to him without that or any\nother axiom as with it, it needing no proof to make it perceived. Nor\nafter the knowledge, that the whole is equal to all its parts, does he\nknow that one and two are equal to three, better or more certainly than\nhe did before. For if there be any odds in those ideas, the whole and\nparts are more obscure, or at least more difficult to be settled in the\nmind than those of one, two, and three. And indeed, I think, I may ask\nthese men, who will needs have all knowledge, besides those general\nprinciples themselves, to depend on general, innate, and self-evident\nprinciples. What principle is requisite to prove that one and one are\ntwo, that two and two are four, that three times two are six? Which\nbeing known without any proof, do evince, That either all knowledge does\nnot depend on certain PRAECOGNITA or general maxims, called principles;\nor else that these are principles: and if these are to be counted\nprinciples, a great part of numeration will be so. To which, if we\nadd all the self-evident propositions which may be made about all\nour distinct ideas, principles will be almost infinite, at least\ninnumerable, which men arrive to the knowledge of, at different ages;\nand a great many of these innate principles they never come to know all\ntheir lives. But whether they come in view of the mind earlier or later,\nthis is true of them, that they are all known by their native evidence;\nare wholly independent; receive no light, nor are capable of any proof\none from another; much less the more particular from the more general,\nor the more simple from the more compounded; the more simple and\nless abstract being the most familiar, and the easier and earlier\napprehended. But whichever be the clearest ideas, the evidence and\ncertainty of all such propositions is in this, That a man sees the same\nidea to be the same idea, and infallibly perceives two different ideas\nto be different ideas. For when a man has in his understanding the ideas\nof one and of two, the idea of yellow, and the idea of blue, he cannot\nbut certainly know that the idea of one is the idea of one, and not the\nidea of two; and that the idea of yellow is the idea of yellow, and not\nthe idea of blue. For a man cannot confound the ideas in his mind, which\nhe has distinct: that would be to have them confused and distinct at the\nsame time, which is a contradiction: and to have none distinct, is\nto have no use of our faculties, to have no knowledge at all. And,\ntherefore, what idea soever is affirmed of itself, or whatsoever two\nentire distinct ideas are denied one of another, the mind cannot\nbut assent to such a proposition as infallibly true, as soon as it\nunderstands the terms, without hesitation or need of proof, or regarding\nthose made in more general terms and called maxims.\n11. What use these general Maxims or Axioms have.\n[What shall we then say? Are these general maxims of no use? By no\nmeans; though perhaps their use is not that which it is commonly taken\nto be. But, since doubting in the least of what hath been by some\nmen ascribed to these maxims may be apt to be cried out against, as\noverturning the foundations of all the sciences; it may be worth while\nto consider them with respect to other parts of our knowledge, and\nexamine more particularly to what purposes they serve, and to what not.\n{Of no use to prove less general propositions, nor as foundations on\nconsideration of which any science has been built.}\n(1) It is evident from what has been already said, that they are of no\nuse to prove or confirm less general self-evident propositions. (2) It\nis as plain that they are not, nor have been the foundations whereon\nany science hath been built. There is, I know, a great deal of talk,\npropagated from scholastic men, of sciences and the maxims on which\nthey are built: but it has been my ill-luck never to meet with any such\nsciences; much less any one built upon these two maxims, WHAT IS, IS;\nand IT IS IMPOSSIBLE FOR THE SAME THING TO BE AND NOT TO BE. And I would\nbe glad to be shown where any such science, erected upon these or any\nother general axioms is to be found: and should be obliged to any one\nwho would lay before me the frame and system of any science so built on\nthese or any such like maxims, that could not be shown to stand as firm\nwithout any consideration of them. I ask, Whether these general maxims\nhave not the same use in the study of divinity, and in theological\nquestions, that they have in other sciences? They serve here, too, to\nsilence wranglers, and put an end to dispute. But I think that nobody\nwill therefore say, that the Christian religion is built upon these\nmaxims, or that the knowledge we have of it is derived from these\nprinciples. It is from revelation we have received it, and without\nrevelation these maxims had never been able to help us to it. When we\nfind out an idea by whose intervention we discover the connexion of two\nothers, this is a revelation from God to us by the voice of reason:\nfor we then come to know a truth that we did not know before. When God\ndeclares any truth to us, this is a revelation to us by the voice of his\nSpirit, and we are advanced in our knowledge. But in neither of these\ndo we receive our light or knowledge from maxims. But in the one, the\nthings themselves afford it: and we see the truth in them by perceiving\ntheir agreement or disagreement. In the other, God himself affords it\nimmediately to us: and we see the truth of what he says in his unerring\nveracity.\n(3) Nor as helps in the discovery of yet unknown truths.\nThey are not of use to help men forward in the advancement of sciences,\nor new discoveries of yet unknown truths. Mr. Newton, in his never\nenough to be admired book, has demonstrated several propositions, which\nare so many new truths, before unknown to the world, and are further\nadvances in mathematical knowledge: but, for the discovery of these, it\nwas not the general maxims, 'what is, is;' or, 'the whole is bigger than\na part,' or the like, that helped him. These were not the clues that led\nhim into the discovery of the truth and certainty of those propositions.\nNor was it by them that he got the knowledge of those demonstrations,\nbut by finding out intermediate ideas that showed the agreement\nor disagreement of the ideas, as expressed in the propositions he\ndemonstrated. This is the greatest exercise and improvement of human\nunderstanding in the enlarging of knowledge, and advancing the\nsciences; wherein they are far enough from receiving any help from the\ncontemplation of these or the like magnified maxims. Would those who\nhave this traditional admiration of these propositions, that they think\nno step can be made in knowledge without the support of an axiom, no\nstone laid in the building of the sciences without a general maxim,\nbut distinguish between the method of acquiring knowledge, and of\ncommunicating it; between the method of raising any science, and that\nof teaching it to others, as far as it is advanced--they would see\nthat those general maxims were not the foundations on which the first\ndiscoverers raised their admirable structures, nor the keys that\nunlocked and opened those secrets of knowledge. Though afterwards, when\nschools were erected, and sciences had their professors to teach what\nothers had found out, they often made use of maxims, i.e. laid down\ncertain propositions which were self-evident, or to be received\nfor true; which being settled in the minds of their scholars as\nunquestionable verities, they on occasion made use of, to convince them\nof truths in particular instances, that were not so familiar to their\nminds as those general axioms which had before been inculcated to them,\nand carefully settled in their minds. Though these particular instances,\nwhen well reflected on, are no less self-evident to the understanding\nthan the general maxims brought to confirm them: and it was in those\nparticular instances that the first discoverer found the truth, without\nthe help of the general maxims: and so may any one else do, who with\nattention considers them.\n{Maxims of use in the exposition of what has been discovered, and in\nsilencing obstinate wranglers.}\nTo come, therefore, to the use that is made of maxims. (1) They are of\nuse, as has been observed, in the ordinary methods of teaching sciences\nas far as they are advanced: but of little or none in advancing them\nfurther. (2) They are of use in disputes, for the silencing of obstinate\nwranglers, and bringing those contests to some conclusion. Whether a\nneed of them to that end came not in the manner following, I crave leave\nto inquire. The Schools having made disputation the touchstone of men's\nabilities, and the criterion of knowledge, adjudged victory to him that\nkept the field: and he that had the last word was concluded to have the\nbetter of the argument, if not of the cause. But because by this means\nthere was like to be no decision between skilful combatants, whilst one\nnever failed of a MEDIUS TERMINUS to prove any proposition; and the\nother could as constantly, without or with a distinction, deny the major\nor minor; to prevent, as much as could be, running out of disputes into\nan endless train of syllogisms, certain general propositions--most of\nthem, indeed, self-evident--were introduced into the Schools: which\nbeing such as all men allowed and agreed in, were looked on as general\nmeasures of truth, and served instead of principles (where the\ndisputants had not lain down any other between them) beyond which there\nwas no going, and which must not be receded from by either side. And\nthus these maxims, getting the name of principles, beyond which men in\ndispute could not retreat, were by mistake taken to be the originals and\nsources from whence all knowledge began, and the foundations whereon the\nsciences were built. Because when in their disputes they came to any\nof these, they stopped there, and went no further; the matter was\ndetermined. But how much this is a mistake, hath been already shown.\n{How Maxims came to be so much in vogue.}\nThis method of the Schools, which have been thought the fountains of\nknowledge, introduced, as I suppose, the like use of these maxims into\na great part of conversation out of the Schools, to stop the mouths of\ncavillers, whom any one is excused from arguing any longer with,\nwhen they deny these general self-evident principles received by all\nreasonable men who have once thought of them: but yet their use herein\nis but to put an end to wrangling. They in truth, when urged in such\ncases, teach nothing: that is already done by the intermediate ideas\nmade use of in the debate, whose connexion may be seen without the help\nof those maxims, and so the truth known before the maxim is produced,\nand the argument brought to a first principle. Men would give off\na wrong argument before it came to that, if in their disputes they\nproposed to themselves the finding and embracing of truth, and not a\ncontest for victory. And thus maxims have their use to put a stop to\ntheir perverseness, whose ingenuity should have yielded sooner. But the\nmethod of the Schools having allowed and encouraged men to oppose and\nresist evident truth till they are baffled, i.e. till they are reduced\nto contradict themselves, or some established principles: it is no\nwonder that they should not in civil conversation be ashamed of that\nwhich in the Schools is counted a virtue and a glory, viz. obstinately\nto maintain that side of the question they have chosen, whether true or\nfalse, to the last extremity; even after conviction. A strange way to\nattain truth and knowledge: and that which I think the rational part of\nmankind, not corrupted by education, could scare believe should ever\nbe admitted amongst the lovers of truth, and students of religion or\nnature, or introduced into the seminaries of those who are to propegate\nthe truths of religion or philosophy amongst the ignorant and\nunconvinced. How much such a way of learning is like to turn young men's\nminds from the sincere search and love of truth; nay, and to make them\ndoubt whether there is any such thing, or, at least, worth the adhering\nto, I shall not now inquire. This I think, that, bating those places,\nwhich brought the Peripatetic Philosophy into their schools, where it\ncontinued many ages, without teaching the world anything but the art of\nwrangling, these maxims were nowhere thought the foundations on which\nthe sciences were built, nor the great helps to the advancement of\nknowledge.]\n{Of great use to stop wranglers in disputes, but of little use to the\ndiscovery of truths.}\nAs to these general maxims, therefore, they are, as I have said, of\ngreat use in disputes, to stop the mouths of wranglers; but not of much\nuse to the discovery of unknown truths, or to help the mind forwards in\nits search after knowledge. For who ever began to build his knowledge on\nthis general proposition, WHAT IS, IS; or, IT IS IMPOSSIBLE FOR THE SAME\nTHING TO BE AND NOT TO BE: and from either of these, as from a principle\nof science, deduced a system of useful knowledge? Wrong opinions often\ninvolving contradictions, one of these maxims, as a touchstone, may\nserve well to show whither they lead. But yet, however fit to lay open\nthe absurdity or mistake of a man's reasoning or opinion, they are of\nvery little use for enlightening the understanding: and it will not be\nfound that the mind receives much help from them in its progress in\nknowledge; which would be neither less, nor less certain, were these two\ngeneral propositions never thought on. It is true, as I have said, they\nsometimes serve in argumentation to stop a wrangler's mouth, by showing\nthe absurdity of what he saith, [and by exposing him to the shame of\ncontradicting what all the world knows, and he himself cannot but own to\nbe true.] But it is one thing to show a man that he is in an error, and\nanother to put him in possession of truth, and I would fain know what\ntruths these two propositions are able to teach, and by their influence\nmake us know which we did not know before, or could not know without\nthem. Let us reason from them as well as we can, they are only about\nidentical predications, and influence, if any at all, none but such.\nEach particular proposition concerning identity or diversity is as\nclearly and certainly known in itself, if attended to, as either of\nthese general ones: [only these general ones, as serving in all cases,\nare therefore more inculcated and insisted on.] As to other less general\nmaxims, many of them are no more than bare verbal propositions, and\nteach us nothing but the respect and import of names one to another.\n'The whole is equal to all its parts:' what real truth, I beseech you,\ndoes it teach us? What more is contained in that maxim, than what the\nsignification of the word TOTUM, or the WHOLE, does of itself import?\nAnd he that knows that the WORD whole stands for what is made up of all\nits parts, knows very little less than that the whole is equal to all\nits parts. And, upon the same ground, I think that this proposition, 'A\nhill is higher than a valley', and several the like, may also pass for\nmaxims. But yet [masters of mathematics, when they would, as teachers of\nwhat they know, initiate others in that science do not] without reason\nplace this and some other such maxims [at the entrance of their\nsystems]; that their scholars, having in the beginning perfectly\nacquainted their thoughts with these propositions, made in such general\nterms, may be used to make such reflections, and have these more general\npropositions, as formed rules and sayings, ready to apply to all\nparticular cases. Not that if they be equally weighed, they are more\nclear and evident than the particular instances they are brought to\nconfirm; but that, being more familiar to the mind, the very naming them\nis enough to satisfy the understanding. But this, I say, is more from\nour custom of using them, and the establishment they have got in our\nminds by our often thinking of them, than from the different evidence\nof the things. But before custom has settled methods of thinking and\nreasoning in our minds, I am apt to imagine it is quite otherwise; and\nthat the child, when a part of his apple is taken away, knows it better\nin that particular instance, than by this general proposition, 'The\nwhole is equal to all its parts;' and that, if one of these have need to\nbe confirmed to him by the other, the general has more need to be let\ninto his mind by the particular, than the particular by the general.\nFor in _particulars_ our knowledge begins, and so spreads itself, by\ndegrees, to _generals_ [Footnote: This is the order in time of the\nconscious acquistion of knowledge that is human. The _Essay_ might be\nregarded as a commentary on this one sentence. Our intellectual progress\nis from particulars and involuntary recipiency, through reactive doubt\nand criticism, into what is at last reasoned faith.]. Though afterwards\nthe mind takes the quite contrary course, and having drawn its knowledge\ninto as general propositions as it can, makes those familiar to its\nthoughts, and accustoms itself to have recourse to them, as to the\nstandards of truth and falsehood. [Footnote: This is the philosophic\nattitude. Therein one consciously apprehends the intellectual\nnecessities that were UNCONCIOUSLY PRESUPPOSED, its previous\nintellectual progress. In philosophy we 'draw our knowledge into as\ngeneral propositions as it can' be made to assume, and thus either learn\nto see it as an organic while in a speculative unity, or learn that it\ncannot be so seen in a finite intelligence, and that even at the last\nit must remain 'broken' and mysterious in the human understanding. ]\nBy which familiar use of them, as rules to measure the truth of other\npropositions, it comes in time to be thought, that more particular\npropositions have their truth and evidence from their conformity to\nthese more general ones, which, in discourse and argumentation, are so\nfrequently urged, and constantly admitted. And this I think to be the\nreason why, amongst so many self-evident propositions, the MOST\nGENERAL ONLY have had the title of MAXIMS.\n12. Maxims, if care be not taken in the Use of Words, may prove\nContradictions.\nOne thing further, I think, it may not be amiss to observe concerning\nthese general maxims, That they are so far from improving or\nestablishing our minds in true knowledge that if our notions be wrong,\nloose, or unsteady, and we resign up our thoughts to the sound of words,\nrather than [fix them on settled, determined] ideas of things; I say\nthese general maxims will serve to confirm us in mistakes; and in such\na way of use of words, which is most common, will serve to prove\ncontradictions: v.g. he that with Descartes shall frame in his mind\nan idea of what he calls body to be nothing but extension, may easily\ndemonstrate that there is no vacuum, i.e. no space void of body, by this\nmaxim, WHAT IS, IS. For the idea to which he annexes the name body,\nbeing bare extension, his knowledge that space cannot be without\nbody, is certain. For he knows his own idea of extension clearly and\ndistinctly, and knows that it is what it is, and not another idea,\nthough it be called by these three names,--extension, body, space. Which\nthree words, standing for one and the same idea, may, no doubt, with\nthe same evidence and certainty be affirmed one of another, as each of\nitself: and it is as certain, that, whilst I use them all to stand for\none and the same idea, this predication is as true and identical in its\nsignification, that 'space is body,' as this predication is true and\nidentical, that 'body is body,' both in signification and sound.\n13. Instance in Vacuum.\nBut if another should come and make to himself another idea, different\nfrom Descartes's, of the thing, which yet with Descartes he calls by the\nsame name body, and make his idea, which he expresses by the word body,\nto be of a thing that hath both extension and solidity together; he will\nas easily demonstrate, that there may be a vacuum or space without a\nbody, as Descartes demonstrated the contrary. Because the idea to which\nhe gives the name space being barely the simple one of extension, and\nthe idea to which he gives the name body being the complex idea of\nextension and resistibility or solidity, together in the same\nsubject, these two ideas are not exactly one and the same, but in the\nunderstanding as distinct as the ideas of one and two, white and black,\nor as of CORPOREITY and HUMANITY, if I may use those barbarous terms:\nand therefore the predication of them in our minds, or in words standing\nfor them, is not identical, but the negation of them one of another;\n[viz. this proposition: 'Extension or space is not body,' is] as true\nand evidently certain as this maxim, IT IS IMPOSSIBLE FOR THE SAME THING\nTO BE AND NOT TO BE, [can make any proposition.]\n14. But they prove not the Existance of things without us.\nBut yet, though both these propositions (as you see) may be equally\ndemonstrated, viz. that there may be a vacuum, and that there cannot be\na vacuum, by these two certain principles, viz. WHAT IS, IS, and THE\nSAME THING CANNOT BE AND NOT BE: yet neither of these principles will\nserve to prove to us, that any, or what bodies do exist: for that we are\nleft to our senses to discover to us as far as they can. Those universal\nand self-evident principles being only our constant, clear, and distinct\nknowledge of our own ideas, more general or comprehensive, can assure us\nof nothing that passes without the mind: their certainty is founded\nonly upon the knowledge we have of each idea by itself, and of its\ndistinction from others, about which we cannot be mistaken whilst they\nare in our minds; though we may be and often are mistaken when we retain\nthe names without the ideas; or use them confusedly, sometimes for\none and sometimes for another idea. In which cases the force of these\naxioms, reaching only to the sound, and not the signification of the\nwords, serves only to lead us into confusion, mistake, and error. [It is\nto show men that these maxims, however cried up for the great guards of\ntruth, will not secure them from error in a careless loose use of their\nwords, that I have made this remark. In all that is here suggested\nconcerning their little use for the improvement of knowledge, or\ndangerous use in undetermined ideas, I have been far enough from saying\nor intending they should be laid aside; as some have been too forward\nto charge me. I affirm them to be truths, self-evident truths; and so\ncannot be laid aside. As far as their influence will reach, it is in\nvain to endeavour, nor will I attempt, to abridge it. But yet, without\nany injury to truth or knowledge, I may have reason to think their use\nis not answerable to the great stress which seems to be laid on them;\nand I may warn men not to make an ill use of them, for the confirming\nthemselves in errors.]\n15. They cannot add to our knowledge of Substances, and their\nApplication to complex Ideas is dangerous.\nBut let them be of what use they will in verbal propositions, they\ncannot discover or prove to us the least knowledge of the nature of\nsubstances, as they are found and exist without us, any further than\ngrounded on experience. And though the consequence of these two\npropositions, called principles, be very clear, and their use not\ndangerous or hurtful, in the probation of such things wherein there is\nno need at all of them for proof, but such as are clear by themselves\nwithout them, viz. where our ideas are [determined] and known by the\nnames that stand for them: yet when these principles, viz. WHAT IS, IS,\nand IT IS IMPOSSIBLE FOR THE SAME THING TO BE AND NOT TO BE, are made\nuse of in the probation of propositions wherein are words standing for\ncomplex ideas, v.g. man, horse, gold, virtue; there they are of infinite\ndanger, and most commonly make men receive and retain falsehood for\nmanifest truth, and uncertainty for demonstration: upon which follow\nerror, obstinacy, and all the mischiefs that can happen from wrong\nreasoning. The reason whereof is not, that these principles are less\ntrue [or of less force] in proving propositions made of terms standing\nfor complex ideas, than where the propositions are about simple ideas.\n[But because men mistake generally,--thinking that where the same terms\nare preserved, the propositions are about the same things, though the\nideas they stand for are in truth different, therefore these maxims\nare made use of to support those which in sound and appearance are\ncontradictory propositions; and is clear in the demonstrations above\nmentioned about a vacuum. So that whilst men take words for things,\nas usually they do, these maxims may and do commonly serve to prove\ncontradictory propositions; as shall yet be further made manifest]\n16. Instance in demonstrations about Man which can only be verbal.\nFor instance: let MAN be that concerning which you would by these first\nprinciples demonstrate anything, and we shall see, that so far as\ndemonstration is by these principles, it is only verbal, and gives us\nno certain, universal, true proposition, or knowledge, of any being\nexisting without us. First, a child having framed the idea of a man, it\nis probable that his idea is just like that picture which the\npainter makes of the visible appearances joined together; and such a\ncomplication of ideas together in his understanding makes up the single\ncomplex idea which he calls man, whereof white or flesh-colour in\nEngland being one, the child can demonstrate to you that a negro is not\na man, because white colour was one of the constant simple ideas of the\ncomplex idea he calls man; and therefore he can demonstrate, by the\nprinciple, IT IS IMPOSSIBLE FOR THE SAME THING TO BE AND NOT TO BE, that\na negro is NOT a man; the foundation of his certainty being not that\nuniversal proposition, which perhaps he never heard nor thought of, but\nthe clear, distinct perception he hath of his own simple ideas of black\nand white, which he cannot be persuaded to take, nor can ever mistake\none for another, whether he knows that maxim or no. And to this child,\nor any one who hath such an idea, which he calls man, can you never\ndemonstrate that a man hath a soul, because his idea of man includes no\nsuch notion or idea in it. And therefore, to him, the principle of WHAT\nIS, IS, proves not this matter; but it depends upon collection and\nobservation, by which he is to make his complex idea called man.\n17. Another instance.\nSecondly, Another that hath gone further in framing and collecting the\nidea he calls MAN, and to the outward shape adds laughter and rational\ndiscourse, may demonstrate that infants and changelings are no men, by\nthis maxim, IT IS IMPOSSIBLE FOR THE SAME THING TO BE AND NOT TO BE; and\nI have discoursed with very rational men, who have actually denied that\nthey are men.\n18. A third instance.\nThirdly, Perhaps another makes up the complex idea which he calls MAN,\nonly out of the ideas of body in general, and the powers of language and\nreason, and leaves out the shape wholly: this man is able to demonstrate\nthat a man may have no hands, but be QUADRUPES, neither of those being\nincluded in his idea of man: and in whatever body or shape he found\nspeech and reason joined, that was a man; because, having a clear\nknowledge of such a complex idea, it is certain that WHAT IS, IS.\n19. Little use of these Maxims in Proofs where we have clear and\ndistinct Ideas.\nSo that, if rightly considered, I think we may say, That where our ideas\nare determined in our minds, and have annexed to them by us known and\nsteady names under those settled determinations, there is little need,\nor no use at all of these maxims, to prove the agreement or disagreement\nof any of them. He that cannot discern the truth or falsehood of such\npropositions, without the help of these and the like maxims, will not be\nhelped by these maxims to do it: since he cannot be supposed to know the\ntruth of these maxims themselves without proof, if he cannot know the\ntruth of others without proof, which are as self-evident as these. Upon\nthis ground it is that intuitive knowledge neither requires nor admits\nany proof, one part of it more than another. He that will suppose it\ndoes, takes away the foundation of all knowledge and certainty; and he\nthat needs any proof to make him certain, and give his assent to this\nproposition, that two are equal to two, will also have need of a proof\nto make him admit, that what is, is. He that needs a probation to\nconvince him that two are not three, that white is not black, that a\ntriangle is not a circle, &c., or any other two [determined] distinct\nideas are not one and the same, will need also a demonstration to\nconvince him that IT IS IMPOSSIBLE FOR THE SAME THING TO BE AND NOT TO\nBE.\n20. Their Use dangerous where our Ideas are not determined\nAnd as these maxims are of little use where we have determined ideas, so\nthey are, as I have showed, of dangerous use where [our ideas are not\ndetermined; and where] we use words that are not annexed to determined\nideas, but such as are of a loose and wandering signification, sometimes\nstanding for one, and sometimes for another idea: from which follow\nmistake and error, which these maxims (brought as proofs to establish\npropositions, wherein the terms stand for undetermined ideas) do by\ntheir authority confirm and rivet.\nCHAPTER VIII. OF TRIFLING PROPOSITIONS.\n1. Some Propositions bring no Increase to our Knowledge.\nWHETHER the maxims treated of in the foregoing chapter be of that use to\nreal knowledge as is generally supposed, I leave to be considered.\nThis, I think, may confidently be affirmed, That there ARE universal\npropositions, which, though they be certainly true, yet they add no\nlight to our understanding; bring no increase to our knowledge. Such\nare--\n2. As, First, identical Propositions.\nFirst, All purely IDENTICAL PROPOSITIONS. These obviously and at first\nblush appear to contain no instruction in them; for when we affirm the\nsaid term of itself, whether it be barely verbal, or whether it contains\nany clear and real idea, it shows us nothing but what we must certainly\nknow before, whether such a proposition be either made by, or proposed\nto us. Indeed, that most general one, WHAT IS, IS, may serve sometimes\nto show a man the absurdity he is guilty of, when, by circumlocution or\nequivocal terms, he would in particular instances deny the same thing of\nitself; because nobody will so openly bid defiance to common sense, as\nto affirm visible and direct contradictions in plain words; or, if he\ndoes, a man is excused if he breaks off any further discourse with him.\nBut yet I think I may say, that neither that received maxim, nor any\nother identical proposition, teaches us anything; and though in such\nkind of propositions this great and magnified maxim, boasted to be the\nfoundation of demonstration, may be and often is made use of to confirm\nthem, yet all it proves amounts to no more than this, That the same word\nmay with great certainty be affirmed of itself, without any doubt of the\ntruth of any such proposition; and let me add, also, without any real\nknowledge.\n3. Examples.\nFor, at this rate, any very ignorant person, who can but make a\nproposition, and knows what he means when he says ay or no, may make a\nmillion of propositions of whose truth he may be infallibly certain, and\nyet not know one thing in the world thereby; v.g. 'what is a soul, is a\nsoul;' or, 'a soul is a soul;' 'a spirit is a spirit;' 'a fetiche is a\nfetiche,' &c. These all being equivalent to this proposition, viz. WHAT\nIS, IS; i.e. what hath existence, hath existence; or, who hath a soul,\nhath a soul. What is this more than trifling with words? It is but like\na monkey shifting his oyster from one hand to the other: and had he but\nwords, might no doubt have said, 'Oyster in right hand is subject, and\noyster in left hand is predicate:' and so might have made a self-evident\nproposition of oyster, i.e. oyster is oyster; and yet, with all this,\nnot have been one whit the wiser or more knowing: and that way of\nhandling the matter would much at one have satisfied the monkey's\nhunger, or a man's understanding, and they would have improved in\nknowledge and bulk together.\n4. Secondly, Propositions in which a part of any complex Idea is\npredicated of the Whole.\nII. Another sort of trifling propositions is, WHEN A PART OF THE\nCOMPLEX IDEA IS PREDICATED OF THE NAME OF THE WHOLE; a part of the\ndefinition of the word defined. Such are all propositions wherein the\ngenus is predicated of the species, or more comprehensive of less\ncomprehensive terms. For what information, what knowledge, carries this\nproposition in it, viz. 'Lead is a metal' to a man who knows the complex\nidea the name lead stands for? All the simple ideas that go to the\ncomplex one signified by the term metal, being nothing but what he\nbefore comprehended and signified by the name lead. Indeed, to a man\nthat knows the signification of the word metal, and not of the word\nlead, it is a shorter way to explain the signification of the word lead,\nby saying it is a metal, which at once expresses several of its simple\nideas, than to enumerate them one by one, telling him it is a body very\nheavy, fusible, and malleable.\n5. As part of the Definition of the Term Defined.\nAlike trifling it is to predicate any other part of the definition of\nthe term defined, or to affirm anyone of the simple ideas of a complex\none of the name of the whole complex idea; as, 'All gold is fusible.'\nFor fusibility being one of the simple ideas that goes to the making up\nthe complex one the sound gold stands for, what can it be but playing\nwith sounds, to affirm that of the name gold, which is comprehended\nin its received signification? It would be thought little better than\nridiculous to affirm gravely, as a truth of moment, that gold is yellow;\nand I see not how it is any jot more material to say it is fusible,\nunless that quality be left out of the complex idea, of which the sound\ngold is the mark in ordinary speech. What instruction can it carry with\nit, to tell one that which he hath been told already, or he is supposed\nto know before? For I am supposed to know the signification of the word\nanother uses to me, or else he is to tell me. And if I know that the\nname gold stands for this complex idea of body, yellow, heavy, fusible,\nmalleable, it will not much instruct me to put it solemnly afterwards in\na proposition, and gravely say, all gold is fusible. Such propositions\ncan only serve to show the disingenuity of one who will go from the\ndefinition of his own terms, by reminding him sometimes of it; but carry\nno knowledge with them, but of the signification of words, however\ncertain they be.\n6. Instance, Man and Palfrey.\n'Every man is an animal, or living body,' is as certain a proposition as\ncan be; but no more conducing to the knowledge of things than to say, a\npalfrey is an ambling horse, or a neighing, ambling animal, both being\nonly about the signification of words, and make me know but this--That\nbody, sense, and motion, or power of sensation and moving, are three of\nthose ideas that I always comprehend and signify by the word man: and\nwhere they are not to be found together, the NAME MAN belongs not to\nthat thing: and so of the other--That body, sense, and a certain way of\ngoing, with a certain kind of voice, are some of those ideas which I\nalways comprehend and signify by the WORD PALFREY; and when they are not\nto be found together, the name palfrey belongs not to that thing. It is\njust the same, and to the same purpose, when any term standing for any\none or more of the simple ideas, that altogether make up that complex\nidea which is called man, is affirmed of the term man:--v.g. suppose a\nRoman signified by the word HOMO all these distinct ideas united in one\nsubject, CORPORIETAS, SENSIBILITAS, POTENTIA SE MOVENDI, RATIONALITAS,\nRISIBILITAS; he might, no doubt, with great certainty, universally\naffirm one, more, or all of these together of the word HOMO, but did no\nmore than say that the word HOMO, in his country, comprehended in its\nsignification all these ideas. Much like a romance knight, who by\nthe word PALFREY signified these ideas:--body of a certain figure,\nfour-legged, with sense, motion, ambling, neighing, white, used to have\na woman on his back--might with the same certainty universally affirm\nalso any or all of these of the WORD palfrey: but did thereby teach no\nmore, but that the word palfrey, in his or romance language, stood for\nall these, and was not to be applied to anything where any of these was\nwanting But he that shall tell me, that in whatever thing sense, motion,\nreason, and laughter, were united, that thing had actually a notion of\nGod, or would be cast into a sleep by opium, made indeed an instructive\nproposition: because neither having the notion of God, nor being cast\ninto sleep by opium, being contained in the idea signified by the word\nman, we are by such propositions taught something more than barely what\nthe word MAN stands for: and therefore the knowledge contained in it is\nmore than verbal.\n7. For this teaches but the Signification of Words.\nBefore a man makes any proposition, he is supposed to understand the\nterms he uses in it, or else he talks like a parrot, only making a noise\nby imitation, and framing certain sounds, which he has learnt of others;\nbut not as a rational creature, using them for signs of ideas which he\nhas in his mind. The hearer also is supposed to understand the terms\nas the speaker uses them, or else he talks jargon, and makes an\nunintelligible noise. And therefore he trifles with words who makes such\na proposition, which, when it is made, contains no more than one of the\nterms does, and which a man was supposed to know before: v.g. a triangle\nhath three sides, or saffron is yellow. And this is no further tolerable\nthan where a man goes to explain his terms to one who is supposed or\ndeclares himself not to understand him; and then it teaches only the\nsignification of that word, and the use of that sign.\n8. But adds no real Knowledge.\nWe can know then the truth of two sorts of propositions with perfect\ncertainty. The one is, of those trifling propositions which have\na certainty in them, but it is only a verbal certainty, but not\ninstructive. And, secondly, we can know the truth, and so may be certain\nin propositions, which affirm something of another, which is a necessary\nconsequence of its precise complex idea, but not contained in it: as\nthat, the external angle of all triangles is bigger than either of the\nopposite internal angles. Which relation of the outward angle to either\nof the opposite internal angles, making no part of the complex idea\nsignified by the name triangle, this is a real truth, and conveys with\nit instructive real knowledge.\n9. General Propositions concerning Substances are often trifling.\nWe having little or no knowledge of what combinations there be of simple\nideas existing together in substances, but by our senses, we cannot make\nany universal certain propositions concerning them, any further than our\nnominal essences lead us. Which being to a very few and inconsiderable\ntruths, in respect of those which depend on their real constitutions,\nthe general propositions that are made about substances, if they are\ncertain, are for the most part but trifling; and if they are\ninstructive, are uncertain, and such as we can have no knowledge of\ntheir real truth, how much soever constant observation and analogy may\nassist our judgment in guessing. Hence it comes to pass, that one may\noften meet with very clear and coherent discourses, that amount yet to\nnothing. For it is plain that names of substantial beings, as well as\nothers, as far as they have relative significations affixed to them,\nmay, with great truth, be joined negatively and affirmatively in\npropositions, as their relative definitions make them fit to be so\njoined; and propositions consisting of such terms, may, with the same\nclearness, be deduced one from another, as those that convey the most\nreal truths: and all this without any knowledge of the nature or reality\nof things existing without us. By this method one may make\ndemonstrations and undoubted propositions in words, and yet thereby\nadvance not one jot in the knowledge of the truth of things: v. g. he\nthat having learnt these following words, with their ordinary mutual\nrelative acceptations annexed to them; v. g. SUBSTANCE, MAN, ANIMAL,\nFORM, SOUL, VEGETATIVE, SENSITIVE, RATIONAL, may make several undoubted\npropositions about the soul, without knowing at all what the soul really\nis: and of this sort, a man may find an infinite number of propositions,\nreasonings, and conclusions, in books of metaphysics, school-divinity,\nand some sort of natural philosophy; and, after all, know as little of\nGod, spirits, or bodies, as he did before he set out.\n10. And why.\nHe that hath liberty to define, i.e. to determine the signification of\nhis names of substances (as certainly every one does in effect, who\nmakes them stand for his own ideas), and makes their significations at a\nventure, taking them from his own or other men's fancies, and not from\nan examination or inquiry into the nature of things themselves; may with\nlittle trouble demonstrate them one of another, according to those\nseveral respects and mutual relations he has given them one to another;\nwherein, however things agree or disagree in their own nature, he needs\nmind nothing but his own notions, with the names he hath bestowed upon\nthem: but thereby no more increases his own knowledge than he does his\nriches, who, taking a bag of counters, calls one in a certain place a\npound, another in another place a shilling, and a third in a third place\na penny; and so proceeding, may undoubtedly reckon right, and cast up a\ngreat sum, according to his counters so placed, and standing for more or\nless as he pleases, without being one jot the richer, or without even\nknowing how much a pound, shilling, or penny is, but only that one is\ncontained in the other twenty times, and contains the other twelve:\nwhich a man may also do in the signification of words, by making them,\nin respect of one another, more or less, or equally comprehensive.\n11. Thirdly, using Words variously is trifling with them.\nThough yet concerning most words used in discourses, equally\nargumentative and controversial, there is this more to be complained of,\nwhich is the worst sort of trifling, and which sets us yet further from\nthe certainty of knowledge we hope to attain by them, or find in them;\nviz. that most writers are so far from instructing us in the nature and\nknowledge of things, that they use their words loosely and uncertainly,\nand do not, by using them constantly and steadily in the same\nsignifications make plain and clear deductions of words one from\nanother, and make their discourses coherent and clear, (how little\nsoever they were instructive); which were not difficult to do, did they\nnot find it convenient to shelter their ignorance or obstinacy under the\nobscurity and perplexedness of their terms: to which, perhaps,\ninadvertency and ill custom do in many men much contribute.\n12. Marks of verbal Propositions. First, Predication in Abstract.\nTo conclude. Barely verbal propositions may be known by these following\nmarks:\nFirst, All propositions wherein two abstract terms are affirmed one of\nanother, are barely about the signification of sounds. For since no\nabstract idea can be the same with any other but itself, when its\nabstract name is affirmed of any other term, it can signify no more but\nthis, that it may, or ought to be called by that name; or that these two\nnames signify the same idea. Thus, should any one say that parsimony is\nfrugality, that gratitude is justice, that this or that action is or is\nnot temperate: however specious these and the like propositions may at\nfirst sight seem, yet when we come to press them, and examine nicely\nwhat they contain, we shall find that it all amounts to nothing but the\nsignification of those terms.\n13. Secondly, A part of the Definition predicated of any Term.\nSecondly, All propositions wherein a part of the complex idea which any\nterm stands for is predicated of that term, are only verbal: v.g. to say\nthat gold is a metal, or heavy. And thus all propositions wherein more\ncomprehensive words, called genera, are affirmed of subordinate or less\ncomprehensive, called species, or individuals, are barely verbal.\nWhen by these two rules we have examined the propositions that make up\nthe discourses we ordinarily meet with, both in and out of books, we\nshall perhaps find that a greater part of them than is usually suspected\nare purely about the signification of words, and contain nothing in them\nbut the use and application of these signs.\nThis I think I may lay down for an infallible rule, That, wherever the\ndistinct idea any word stands for is not known and considered, and\nsomething not contained in the idea is not affirmed or denied of it,\nthere our thoughts stick wholly in sounds, and are able to attain no\nreal truth or falsehood. This, perhaps, if well heeded, might save us a\ngreat deal of useless amusement and dispute; and very much shorten our\ntrouble and wandering in the search of real and true knowledge.\nCHAPTER IX. OF OUR THREEFOLD KNOWLEDGE OF EXISTENCE.\n1. General Propositions that are certain concern not Existence.\nHITHERTO we have only considered the essences of things; which being\nonly abstract ideas, and thereby removed in our thoughts from particular\nexistence, (that being the proper operation of the mind, in abstraction,\nto consider an idea under no other existence but what it has in the\nunderstandings,) gives us no knowledge of real existence at all. Where,\nby the way, we may take notice, that universal propositions of whose\ntruth or falsehood we can have certain knowledge concern not existence:\nand further, that all particular affirmations or negations that would\nnot be certain if they were made general, are only concerning existence;\nthey declaring only the accidental union or separation of ideas in\nthings existing, which, in their abstract natures, have no known\nnecessary union or repugnancy.\n2. A threefold Knowledge of Existence.\nBut, leaving the nature of propositions, and different ways of\npredication to be considered more at large in another place, let us\nproceed now to inquire concerning our knowledge of the EXISTANCE OF\nTHINGS, and how we come by it. I say, then, that we have the knowledge\nof OUR OWN existence by intuition; of the existence of GOD by\ndemonstration; and of OTHER THINGS by sensation.\n3. Our Knowledge of our own Existence is Intuitive.\nAs for OUR OWN EXISTENCE, we perceive it so plainly and so certainly,\nthat it neither needs nor is capable of any proof for nothing can be\nmore evident to us than our own existence. I think, I reason, I feel\npleasure and pain: can any of these be more evident to me than my own\nexistence? If I doubt of all other things, that very doubt makes me\nperceive my own existence, and will not suffer me to doubt of that. For\nif I know I feel pain, it is evident I have as certain perception of my\nown existence, as of the existence of the pain I feel: or if I know\nI doubt, I have as certain perception of the existence of the thing\ndoubting, as of that thought which I CALL DOUBT. Experience then\nconvinces us, that we have an INTUITIVE KNOWLEDGE of our own existence,\nand an internal infallible perception that we are. In every act of\nsensation, reasoning, or thinking, we are conscious to ourselves of our\nown being; and, in this matter, come not short of the highest degree of\ncertainty.\nCHAPTER X. OF OUR KNOWLEDGE OF THE EXISTENCE OF A GOD.\n1. We are capable of knowing certainly that there is a God.\nTHOUGH God has given us no innate ideas of himself; though he has\nstamped no original characters on our minds, wherein we may read his\nbeing; yet having furnished us with those faculties our minds are\nendowed with, he hath not left himself without witness: since we have\nsense, perception, and reason, and cannot want a clear proof of him, as\nlong as we carry OURSELVES about us. Nor can we justly complain of our\nignorance in this great point; since he has so plentifully provided us\nwith the means to discover and know him; so far as is necessary to the\nend of our being, and the great concernment of our happiness. But,\nthough this be the most obvious truth that reason discovers, and though\nits evidence be (if I mistake not) equal to mathematical certainty: yet\nit requires thought and attention; and the mind must apply itself to a\nregular deduction of it from some part of our intuitive knowledge,\nor else we shall be as uncertain and ignorant of this as of other\npropositions, which are in themselves capable of clear demonstration. To\nshow, therefore, that we are capable of KNOWING, i.e. BEING CERTAIN that\nthere is a God, and HOW WE MAY COME BY this certainty, I think we need\ngo no further than OURSELVES, and that undoubted knowledge we have of\nour own existence.\n2. For Man knows that he himself exists.\nI think it is beyond question, that man has a clear idea of his own\nbeing; he knows certainly he exists, and that he is something. He that\ncan doubt whether he be anything or no, I speak not to; no more than I\nwould argue with pure nothing, or endeavour to convince nonentity that\nit were something. If any one pretends to be so sceptical as to deny his\nown existence, (for really to doubt of it is manifestly impossible,) let\nhim for me enjoy his beloved happiness of being nothing, until hunger or\nsome other pain convince him of the contrary. This, then, I think I may\ntake for a truth, which every one's certain knowledge assures him of,\nbeyond the liberty of doubting, viz. that he is SOMETHING THAT ACTUALLY\nEXISTS.\n3. He knows also that Nothing cannot produce a Being; therefore\nSomething must have existed from Eternity.\nIn the next place, man knows, by an intuitive certainty, that bare\nNOTHING CAN NO MORE PRODUCE ANY REAL BEING, THAN IT CAN BE EQUAL TO TWO\nRIGHT ANGLES. If a man knows not that nonentity, or the absence of all\nbeing, cannot be equal to two right angles, it is impossible he should\nknow any demonstration in Euclid. If, therefore, we know there is some\nreal being, and that nonentity cannot produce any real being, it is an\nevident demonstration, that FROM ETERNITY THERE HAS BEEN SOMETHING;\nsince what was not from eternity had a beginning; and what had a\nbeginning must be produced by something else.\n4. And that eternal Being must be most powerful.\nNext, it is evident, that what had its being and beginning from another,\nmust also have all that which is in and belongs to its being from\nanother too. All the powers it has must be owing to and received from\nthe same source. This eternal source, then, of all being must also be\nthe source and original of all power; and so THIS ETERNAL BEING MUST BE\nALSO THE MOST POWERFUL.\n5. And most knowing.\nAgain, a man finds in HIMSELF perception and knowledge. We have then got\none step further; and we are certain now that there is not only some\nbeing, but some knowing, intelligent being in the world. There was a\ntime, then, when there was no knowing being, and when knowledge began to\nbe; or else there has been also A KNOWING BEING FROM ETERNITY. If it\nbe said, there was a time when no being had any knowledge, when that\neternal being was void of all understanding; I reply, that then it\nwas impossible there should ever have been any knowledge: it being as\nimpossible that things wholly void of knowledge, and operating blindly,\nand without any perception, should produce a knowing being, as it is\nimpossible that a triangle should make itself three angles bigger than\ntwo right ones. For it is as repugnant to the idea of senseless matter,\nthat it should put into itself sense, perception, and knowledge, as it\nis repugnant to the idea of a triangle, that it should put into itself\ngreater angles than two right ones.\n6. And therefore God.\nThus, from the consideration of ourselves, and what we infallibly find\nin our own constitutions, our reason leads us to the knowledge of this\ncertain and evident truth,--THAT THERE IS AN ETERNAL, MOST POWERFUL, AND\nMOST KNOWING BEING; which whether any one will please to call God, it\nmatters not. The thing is evident; and from this idea duly considered,\nwill easily be deduced all those other attributes, which we ought to\nascribe to this eternal Being. [If, nevertheless, any one should be\nfound so senselessly arrogant, as to suppose man alone knowing and wise,\nbut yet the product of mere ignorance and chance; and that all the rest\nof the universe acted only by that blind haphazard; I shall leave with\nhim that very rational and emphatical rebuke of Tully (1. ii. De Leg.),\nto be considered at his leisure: 'What can be more sillily arrogant\nand misbecoming, than for a man to think that he has a mind and\nunderstanding in him, but yet in all the universe beside there is no\nsuch thing? Or that those things, which with the utmost stretch of his\nreason he can scarce comprehend, should be moved and managed without any\nreason at all?' QUID EST ENIM VERIUS, QUAM NEMINEM ESSE OPORTERE TAM\nSTULTE AROGANTEM, UT IN SE MENTEM ET RATIONEM PUTET INESSE IN COELO\nMUNDOQUE NON PUTET? AUT EA QUOE VIZ SUMMA INGENII RATIONE COMPREHENDAT,\nNULLA RATIONE MOVERI PUTET?]\nFrom what has been said, it is plain to me we have a more certain\nknowledge of the existence of a God, than of anything: our senses have\nnot immediately discovered to us. Nay, I presume I may say, that we more\ncertainly know that there is a God, than that there is anything else\nwithout us. When I say we KNOW, I mean there is such a knowledge within\nour reach which we cannot miss, if we will but apply our minds to that,\nas we do to several other inquiries.\n7. Our idea of a most perfect Being, not the sole Proof of a God.\nHow far the IDEA of a most perfect being, which a man, may frame in his\nmind, does or does not prove the EXISTENCE of a God, I will not here\nexamine. For in the different make of men's tempers and application of\ntheir thoughts, some arguments prevail more on one, and some on another,\nfor the confirmation of the same truth. But yet, I think, this I may\nsay, that it is an ill way of establishing this truth, and silencing\natheists, to lay the whole stress of so important a point as this upon\nthat sole foundation: and take some men's having that idea of God in\ntheir minds, (for it is evident some men have none, and some worse than\nnone, and the most very different,) for the only proof of a Deity; and\nout of an over fondness of that darling invention, cashier, or at least\nendeavour to invalidate all other arguments; and forbid us to hearken to\nthose proofs, as being weak or fallacious, which our own existence, and\nthe sensible parts of the universe offer so clearly and cogently to our\nthoughts, that I deem it impossible for a considering man to withstand\nthem. For I judge it as certain and clear a truth as can anywhere be\ndelivered, that 'the invisible things of God are clearly seen from the\ncreation of the world, being understood by the things that are made,\neven his eternal power and Godhead.' Though our own being furnishes us,\nas I have shown, with an evident and incontestible proof of a Deity; and\nI believe nobody can avoid the cogency of it, who will but as carefully\nattend to it, as to any other demonstration of so many parts: yet this\nbeing so fundamental a truth, and of that consequence, that all religion\nand genuine morality depend thereon, I doubt not but I shall be forgiven\nby my reader if I go over some parts of this argument again, and enlarge\na little more upon them.\n8. Recapitulation Something from Eternity.\nThere is no truth more evident than that SOMETHING must be FROM\nETERNITY. I never yet heard of any one so unreasonable, or that could\nsuppose so manifest a contradiction, as a time wherein there was\nperfectly nothing. This being of all absurdities the greatest, to\nimagine that pure nothing, the perfect negation and absence of all\nbeings, should ever produce any real existence.\nIt being, then, unavoidable for all rational creatures to conclude, that\nSOMETHING has existed from eternity; let us next see WHAT KIND OF THING\nthat must be.\n9. Two Sorts of Beings, cogitative and incogitative.\nThere are but two sorts of beings in the world that man knows or\nconceives.\nFirst, such as are purely material, without sense, perception, or\nthought, as the clippings of our beards, and parings of our nails.\nSecondly, sensible, thinking, perceiving beings, such as we find\nourselves to be. Which, if you please, we will hereafter call COGITATIVE\nand INCOGITATIVE beings; which to our present purpose, if for nothing\nelse, are perhaps better terms than material and immaterial.\n10. Incogitative Being cannot produce a Cogitative Being.\nIf, then, there must be something eternal, let us see what sort of being\nit must be. And to that it is very obvious to reason, that it must\nnecessarily be a cogitative being. For it is as impossible to conceive\nthat ever bare incogitative matter should produce a thinking intelligent\nbeing, as that nothing should of itself produce matter. Let us suppose\nany parcel of matter eternal, great or small, we shall find it, in\nitself, able to produce nothing. For example: let us suppose the matter\nof the next pebble we meet with eternal, closely united, and the parts\nfirmly at rest together; if there were no other being in the world, must\nit not eternally remain so, a dead inactive lump? Is it possible to\nconceive it can add motion to itself, being purely matter, or produce\nanything? Matter, then, by its own strength, cannot produce in itself so\nmuch as motion: the motion it has must also be from eternity, or else\nbe produced, and added to matter by some other being more powerful than\nmatter; matter, as is evident, having not power to produce motion in\nitself. But let us suppose motion eternal too: yet matter, INCOGITATIVE\nmatter and motion, whatever changes it might produce of figure and bulk,\ncould never produce thought: knowledge will still be as far beyond the\npower of motion and matter to produce, as matter is beyond the power\nof nothing or nonentity to produce. And I appeal to every one's own\nthoughts, whether he cannot as easily conceive matter produced by\nNOTHING, as thought to be produced by pure matter, when, before, there\nwas no such thing as thought or an intelligent being existing? Divide\nmatter into as many parts as you will, (which we are apt to imagine a\nsort of spiritualizing, or making a thinking thing of it,) vary the\nfigure and motion of it as much as you please--a globe, cube, cone,\nprism, cylinder, &c., whose diameters are but 100,000th part of a GRY,\nwill operate no otherwise upon other bodies of proportionable bulk, than\nthose of an inch or foot diameter; and you may as rationally expect to\nproduce sense, thought, and knowledge, by putting together, in a certain\nfigure and motion, gross particles of matter, as by those that are the\nvery minutest that do anywhere exist. They knock, impel, and resist one\nanother, just as the greater do; and that is all they can do. So that,\nif we will suppose NOTHING first or eternal, matter can never begin to\nbe: if we suppose bare matter without motion, eternal, motion can never\nbegin to be: if we suppose only matter and motion first, or eternal,\nthought can never begin to be. [For it is impossible to conceive that\nmatter, either with or without motion, could have, originally, in and\nfrom itself, sense, perception, and knowledge; as is evident from hence,\nthat then sense, perception, and knowledge, must be a property eternally\ninseparable from matter and every particle of it. Not to add, that,\nthough our general or specific conception of matter makes us speak of it\nas one thing, yet really all matter is not one individual thing, neither\nis there any such thing existing as ONE material being, or ONE single\nbody that we know or can conceive. And therefore, if matter were\nthe eternal first cogitative being, there would not be one eternal,\ninfinite, cogitative being, but an infinite number of eternal, finite,\ncogitative beings, independent one of another, of limited force, and\ndistinct thoughts, which could never produce that order, harmony, and\nbeauty which are to be found in nature. Since, therefore, whatsoever is\nthe first eternal being must necessarily be cogitative; and] whatsoever\nis first of all things must necessarily contain in it, and actually\nhave, at least, all the perfections that can ever after exist; nor can\nit ever give to another any perfection that it hath not either actually\nin itself, or, at least, in a higher degree; [it necessarily follows,\nthat the first eternal being cannot be matter.]\n11. Therefore, there has been an Eternal Wisdom.\nIf, therefore, it be evident, that something necessarily must exist from\neternity, it is also as evident, that that something must necessarily\nbe a cogitative being: for it is as impossible that incogitative matter\nshould produce a cogitative being, as that nothing, or the negation of\nall being, should produce a positive being or matter.\n12. The Attributes of the Eternal Cogitative Being.\nThough this discovery of the NECESSARY EXISTANCE OF A ETERNAL MIND does\nsufficiently lead us into the knowledge of God; since it will hence\nfollow, that all other knowing beings that have a beginning must depend\non him, and have in other ways of knowledge or extent of power than what\nHe gives them; and therefore, if he made those, he made all the less\nexcellent pieces of this universe,--all inanimate beings whereby his\nomniscience, power, and providence will be established, and all his\nother attributes necessarily follow yet, to clear up this a little\nfurther, we will see what doubt can be raised against it.\n13. Whether the Eternal Mind may be also material or no.\nFIRST, Perhaps it will be said, that, though it be as clear as\ndemonstration can make it, that there must be an eternal Being, and that\nBeing must also be knowing: yet it does not follow but that thinking\nBeing may also be MATERIAL. Let it be so, it equally still follows that\nthere is a God. For there be an eternal, omniscient, omnipotent Being,\nit is certain that there is a God, whether you imagine that Being to be\nmaterial or no. But herein, I suppose, lies the danger and deceit of\nthat supposition:--there being no way to avoid the demonstration,\nthat there is an eternal knowing Being, men devoted to matter, would\nwillingly have it granted, that that knowing Being is material;\nand then, letting slide out of their minds, or the discourse, the\ndemonstration whereby an eternal KNOWING Being was proved necessarily\nto exist, would argue all to be matter, and so deny a God, that is, an\neternal cogitative Being: whereby they are so far from establishing,\nthat they destroy their own hypothesis. For, if there can be, in their\nopinion, eternal matter, without any eternal cogitative Being, they\nmanifestly separate matter and thinking, and suppose no necessary\nconnexion of the one with the other, and so establish the necessity of\nan eternal Spirit, but not of matter; since it has been proved already,\nthat an eternal cogitative Being is unavoidably to be granted. Now, if\nthinking and matter may be separated, the eternal existence of matter\nwill not follow from the eternal existence of a cogitative Being, and\nthey suppose it to no purpose.\n14. Not material: First, because each Particle of Matter is not\ncogitative.\nBut now let us see how they can satisfy themselves, or others, that this\neternal thinking Being is material.\nI. I would ask them, whether they imagine that all matter, EVERY\nPARTICLE OF MATTER, thinks? This, I suppose, they will scarce say;\nsince then there would be as many eternal thinking beings as there are\nparticles of matter, and so an infinity of gods. And yet, if they will\nnot allow matter as matter, that is, every particle of matter, to be as\nwell cogitative as extended, they will have as hard a task to make out\nto their own reasons a cogitative being out of incogitative particles,\nas an extended being out of unextended parts, if I may so speak.\n15. II. Secondly, Because one Particle alone of Matter cannot be\ncogitative.\nIf all matter does not think, I next ask, Whether it be ONLY ONE ATOM\nthat does so? This has as many absurdities as the other; for then this\natom of matter must be alone eternal or not. If this alone be eternal,\nthen this alone, by its powerful thought or will, made all the rest of\nmatter. And so we have the creation of matter by a powerful thought,\nwhich is that the materialists stick at; for if they suppose one single\nthinking atom to have produced all the rest of matter, they cannot\nascribe that pre-eminency to it upon any other account than that of its\nthinking, the only supposed difference. But allow it to be by some other\nway which is above our conception, it must still be creation; and these\nmen must give up their great maxim, EX NIHILO NIL FIT. If it be said,\nthat all the rest of matter is equally eternal as that thinking atom,\nit will be to say anything at pleasure, though ever so absurd. For to\nsuppose all matter eternal, and yet one small particle in knowledge and\npower infinitely above all the rest, is without any the least appearance\nof reason to frame an hypothesis. Every particle of matter, as matter,\nis capable of all the same figures and motions of any other; and I\nchallenge any one, in his thoughts, to add anything else to one above\nanother.\n16. III. Thirdly, Because a System of incogitative Matter cannot be\ncogitative.\nIf then neither one peculiar atom alone can be this eternal thinking\nbeing; nor all matter, as matter, i. e. every particle of matter, can be\nit; it only remains, that it is some certain SYSTEM of matter, duly put\ntogether, that is this thinking eternal Being. This is that which, I\nimagine, is that notion which men are aptest to have of God; who would\nhave him a material being, as most readily suggested to them by the\nordinary conceit they have of themselves and other men, which they take\nto be material thinking beings. But this imagination, however more\nnatural, is no less absurd than the other; for to suppose the eternal\nthinking Being to be nothing else but a composition of particles of\nmatter, each whereof is incogitative, is to ascribe all the wisdom and\nknowledge of that eternal Being only to the juxta-position of parts;\nthan which nothing can be more absurd. For unthinking particles of\nmatter, however put together, can have nothing thereby added to them,\nbut a new relation of position, which it is impossible should give\nthought and knowledge to them.\n17. And whether this corporeal System is in Motion or at Rest.\nBut further: this corporeal system either has all its parts at rest, or\nit is a certain motion of the parts wherein its thinking consists. If it\nbe perfectly at rest, it is but one lump, and so can have no privileges\nabove one atom.\nIf it be the motion of its parts on which its thinking depends, all the\nthoughts there must be unavoidably accidental and limited; since all the\nparticles that by motion cause thought, being each of them in itself\nwithout any thought, cannot regulate its own motions, much less be\nregulated by the thought of the whole; since that thought is not the\ncause of motion, (for then it must be antecedent to it, and so without\nit,) but the consequence of it; whereby freedom, power, choice, and all\nrational and wise thinking or acting, will be quite taken away: so\nthat such a thinking being will be no better nor wiser than pure blind\nmatter; since to resolve all into the accidental unguided motions of\nblind matter, or into thought depending on unguided motions of blind\nmatter, is the same thing: not to mention the narrowness of such\nthoughts and knowledge that must depend on the motion of such parts. But\nthere needs no enumeration of any more absurdities and impossibilities\nin this hypothesis (however full of them it be) than that before\nmentioned; since, let this thinking system be all or a part of the\nmatter of the universe, it is impossible that any one particle should\neither know its own, or the motion of any other particle, or the whole\nknow the motion of every particle; and so regulate its own thoughts or\nmotions, or indeed have any thought resulting from such motion.\n18. Matter not co-eternal with an Eternal Mind.\nSECONDLY, Others would have Matter to be eternal, notwithstanding that\nthey allow an eternal, cogitative, immaterial Being. This, though it\ntake not away the being of a God, yet, since it denies one and the first\ngreat piece of his workmanship, the creation, let us consider it a\nlittle. Matter must be allowed eternal: Why? because you cannot conceive\nhow it can be made out of nothing: why do you not also think yourself\neternal? You will answer, perhaps, Because, about twenty or forty years\nsince, you began to be. But if I ask you, what that YOU is, which began\nthen to be, you can scarce tell me. The matter whereof you are made\nbegan not then to be: for if it did, then it is not eternal: but it\nbegan to be put together in such a fashion and frame as makes up your\nbody; but yet that frame of particles is not you, it makes not that\nthinking thing you are; (for I have now to do with one who allows an\neternal, immaterial, thinking Being, but would have unthinking Matter\neternal too;) therefore, when did that thinking thing begin to be? If it\ndid never begin to be, then have you always been a thinking thing from\neternity; the absurdity whereof I need not confute, till I meet with one\nwho is so void of understanding as to own it. If, therefore, you can\nallow a thinking thing to be made out of nothing, (as all things that\nare not eternal must be,) why also can you not allow it possible for a\nmaterial being to be made out of nothing by an equal power, but that you\nhave the experience of the one in view, and not of the other? Though,\nwhen well considered, creation [of a spirit will be found to require\nno less power than the creation of matter. Nay, possibly, if we would\nemancipate ourselves from vulgar notions, and raise our thoughts, as far\nas they would reach, to a closer contemplation of things, we might be\nable to aim at some dim and seeming conception how MATTER might at first\nbe made, and begin to exist, by the power of that eternal first Being:\nbut to give beginning and being to a SPIRIT would be found a more\ninconceivable effect of omnipotent power. But this being what would\nperhaps lead us too far from the notions on which the philosophy now in\nthe world is built, it would not be pardonable to deviate so far from\nthem; or to inquire, so far as grammar itself would authorize, if the\ncommon settled opinion opposes it: especially in this place, where the\nreceived doctrine serves well enough to our present purpose, and leaves\nthis past doubt, that] the creation or beginning of any one [SUBSTANCE]\nout of nothing being once admitted, the creation of all other but the\nCreator himself, may, with the same ease, be supposed.\n19. Objection: Creation out of nothing.\nBut you will say, Is it not impossible to admit of the making anything\nout of nothing, SINCE WE CANNOT POSSIBLY CONCEIVE IT? I answer, No.\nBecause it is not reasonable to deny the power of an infinite being,\nbecause we cannot comprehend its operations. We do not deny other\neffects upon this ground, because we cannot possibly conceive the manner\nof their production. We cannot conceive how anything but impulse of body\ncan move body; and yet that is not a reason sufficient to make us deny\nit possible, against the constant experience we have of it in ourselves,\nin all our voluntary motions; which are produced in us only by the free\naction or thought of our own minds, and are not, nor can be, the effects\nof the impulse or determination of the motion of blind matter in or upon\nour own bodies; for then it could not be in our power or choice to alter\nit. For example: my right hand writes, whilst my left hand is still:\nWhat causes rest in one, and motion in the other? Nothing but my\nwill,--a thought of my mind; my thought only changing, the right hand\nrests, and the left hand moves. This is matter of fact, which cannot be\ndenied: explain this and make it intelligible, and then the next step\nwill be to understand creation. [For the giving a new determination to\nthe motion of the animal spirits (which some make use of to explain\nvoluntary motion) clears not the difficulty one jot. To alter the\ndetermination of motion, being in this case no easier nor less, than\nto give motion itself: since the new determination given to the animal\nspirits must be either immediately by thought, or by some other body put\nin their way by thought which was not in their way before, and so must\nowe ITS motion to thought: either of which leaves VOLUNTARY motion as\nunintelligible as it was before.] In the meantime, it is an over-valuing\nourselves to reduce all to the narrow measure of our capacities; and to\nconclude all things impossible to be done, whose manner of doing exceeds\nour comprehension. This is to make our comprehension infinite, or God\nfinite, when what He can do is limited to what we can conceive of it.\nIf you do not understand the operations of your own finite mind, that\nthinking thing within you, do not deem it strange that you cannot\ncomprehend the operations of that eternal infinite Mind, who made and\ngoverns all things, and whom the heaven of heavens cannot contain.\nCHAPTER XI.\nOF OUR KNOWLEDGE OF THE EXISTENCE OF OTHER THINGS.\n1. Knowledge of the existence of other Finite Beings is to be had only\nby actual Sensation.\nThe knowledge of our own being we have by intuition. The existence of a\nGod, reason clearly makes known to us, as has been shown.\nThe knowledge of the existence of ANY OTHER THING we can have only by\nSENSATION: for there being no necessary connexion of real existence with\nany IDEA a man hath in his memory; nor of any other existence but that\nof God with the existence of any particular man: no particular man\ncan know the existence of any other being, but only when, by actual\noperating upon him, it makes itself perceived by him. For, the having\nthe idea of anything in our mind, no more proves the existence of that\nthing, than the picture of a man evidences his being in the world, or\nthe visions of a dream make thereby a true history.\n2. Instance: Whiteness of this Paper.\nIt is therefore the ACTUAL RECEIVING of ideas from without that gives\nus notice of the existence of other things, and makes us know, that\nsomething doth exist at that time without us, which causes that idea in\nus; though perhaps we neither know nor consider how it does it. For it\ntakes not from the certainty of our senses, and the ideas we receive by\nthem, that we know not the manner wherein they are produced: v.g. whilst\nI write this, I have, by the paper affecting my eyes, that idea produced\nin my mind, which, whatever object causes, I call WHITE; by which I know\nthat that quality or accident (i.e. whose appearance before my eyes\nalways causes that idea) doth really exist, and hath a being without me.\nAnd of this, the greatest assurance I can possibly have, and to which my\nfaculties can attain, is the testimony of my eyes, which are the proper\nand sole judges of this thing; whose testimony I have reason to rely on\nas so certain, that I can no more doubt, whilst I write this, that I\nsee white and black, and that something really exists that causes that\nsensation in me, than that I write or move my hand; which is a certainty\nas great as human nature is capable of, concerning the existence of\nanything, but a man's self alone, and of God.\n3. This notice by our Senses, though not so certain as Demonstration,\nyet may be called Knowledge, and proves the Existence of Things without\nus.\nThe notice we have by our senses of the existing of things without us,\nthough it be not altogether so certain as our intuitive knowledge, or\nthe deductions of our reason employed about the clear abstract ideas\nof our own minds; yet it is an assurance that deserves the name of\nKNOWLEDGE. If we persuade ourselves that our faculties act and inform\nus right concerning the existence of those objects that affect them, it\ncannot pass for an ill-grounded confidence: for I think nobody can, in\nearnest, be so sceptical as to be uncertain of the existence of those\nthings which he sees and feels. At least, he that can doubt so far,\n(whatever he may have with his own thoughts,) will never have any\ncontroversy with me; since he can never be sure I say anything contrary\nto his own opinion. As to myself, I think God has given me assurance\nenough of the existence of things without me: since, by their different\napplication, I can produce in myself both pleasure and pain, which\nis one great concernment of my present state. This is certain: the\nconfidence that our faculties do not herein deceive us, is the greatest\nassurance we are capable of concerning the existence of material beings.\nFor we cannot act anything but by our faculties; nor talk of knowledge\nitself, but by the help of those faculties which are fitted to apprehend\neven what knowledge is.\nBut besides the assurance we have from our senses themselves, that they\ndo not err in the information they give us of the existence of things\nwithout us, when they are affected by them, we are further confirmed in\nthis assurance by other concurrent reasons:--\n4. I. Confirmed by concurrent reasons:--First, Because we cannot have\nideas of Sensation but by the Inlet of the Senses.\nIt is plain those perceptions are produced in us by exterior causes\naffecting our senses: because those that want the ORGANS of any sense,\nnever can have the ideas belonging to that sense produced in their\nminds. This is too evident to be doubted: and therefore we cannot but be\nassured that they come in by the organs of that sense, and no other way.\nThe organs themselves, it is plain, do not produce them: for then the\neyes of a man in the dark would produce colours, and his nose smell\nroses in the winter: but we see nobody gets the relish of a pineapple,\ntill he goes to the Indies, where it is, and tastes it.\n5. II. Secondly, Because we find that an Idea from actual Sensation, and\nanother from memory, are very distinct Perceptions.\nBecause sometimes I find that I CANNOT AVOID THE HAVING THOSE IDEAS\nPRODUCED IN MY MIND. For though, when my eyes are shut, or windows fast,\nI can at pleasure recal to my mind the ideas of light, or the sun, which\nformer sensations had lodged in my memory; so I can at pleasure lay by\nTHAT idea, and take into my view that of the smell of a rose, or taste\nof sugar. But, if I turn my eyes at noon towards the sun, I cannot avoid\nthe ideas which the light or sun then produces in me. So that there is a\nmanifest difference between the ideas laid up in my memory, (over which,\nif they were there only, I should have constantly the same power to\ndispose of them, and lay them by at pleasure,) and those which force\nthemselves upon me, and I cannot avoid having. And therefore it must\nneeds be some exterior cause, and the brisk acting of some objects\nwithout me, whose efficacy I cannot resist, that produces those ideas\nin my mind, whether I will or no. Besides, there is nobody who doth not\nperceive the difference in himself between contemplating the sun, as\nhe hath the idea of it in his memory, and actually looking upon it: of\nwhich two, his perception is so distinct, that few of his ideas are\nmore distinguishable one from another. And therefore he hath certain\nknowledge that they are not BOTH memory, or the actions of his mind, and\nfancies only within him; but that actual seeing hath a cause without.\n6. III. Thirdly, Because Pleasure or Pain, which accompanies actual\nSensation, accompanies not the returning of those Ideas without the\nexternal Objects.\nAdd to this, that many of those ideas are PRODUCED IN US WITH PAIN,\nwhich afterwards we remember without the least offence. Thus, the pain\nof heat or cold, when the idea of it is revived in our minds, gives us\nno disturbance; which, when felt, was very troublesome; and is again,\nwhen actually repeated: which is occasioned by the disorder the external\nobject causes in our bodies when applied to them: and we remember the\npains of hunger, thirst, or the headache, without any pain at all; which\nwould either never disturb us, or else constantly do it, as often as we\nthought of it, were there nothing more but ideas floating in our minds,\nand appearances entertaining our fancies, without the real existence\nof things affecting us from abroad. The same may be said of PLEASURE,\naccompanying several actual sensations. And though mathematical\ndemonstration depends not upon sense, yet the examining them by diagrams\ngives great credit to the evidence of our sight, and seems to give it a\ncertainty approaching to that of demonstration itself. For, it would be\nvery strange, that a man should allow it for an undeniable truth, that\ntwo angles of a figure, which he measures by lines and angles of a\ndiagram, should be bigger one than the other, and yet doubt of the\nexistence of those lines and angles, which by looking on he makes use of\nto measure that by.\n7. IV. Fourthly, Because our Senses assist one another's Testimony of\nthe Existence of outward Things, and enable us to predict.\nOur SENSES in many cases BEAR WITNESS TO THE TRUTH OF EACH OTHER'S\nREPORT, concerning the existence of sensible things without us. He that\nSEES a fire, may, if he doubt whether it be anything more than a bare\nfancy, FEEL it too; and be convinced, by putting his hand in it. Which\ncertainly could never be put into such exquisite pain by a bare idea or\nphantom, unless that the pain be a fancy too: which yet he cannot, when\nthe burn is well, by raising the idea of it, bring upon himself again.\nThus I see, whilst I write this, I can change the appearance of the\npaper; and by designing the letters, tell BEFOREHAND what new idea it\nshall exhibit the very next moment, by barely drawing my pen over it:\nwhich will neither appear (let me fancy as much as I will) if my hands\nstand still; or though I move my pen, if my eyes be shut: nor, when\nthose characters are once made on the paper, can I choose afterwards but\nsee them as they are; that is, have the ideas of such letters as I have\nmade. Whence it is manifest, that they are not barely the sport and play\nof my own imagination, when I find that the characters that were made at\nthe pleasure of my own thoughts, do not obey them; nor yet cease to be,\nwhenever I shall fancy it, but continue to affect my senses constantly\nand regularly, according to the figures I made them. To which if we will\nadd, that the sight of those shall from another man, draw such sounds as\nI beforehand design they shall stand for, there will be little reason\nleft to doubt that those words I write do really exist without me, when\nthey cause a long series of regular sounds to affect my ears, which\ncould not be the effect of my imagination, nor could my memory retain\nthem in that order.\n8. This Certainty is as great as our Condition needs.\nBut yet, if after all this any one will be so sceptical as to distrust\nhis senses, and to affirm that all we see and hear, feel and taste,\nthink and do, during our whole being, is but the series and deluding\nappearances of a long dream, whereof there is no reality; and therefore\nwill question the existence of all things, or our knowledge of anything:\nI must desire him to consider, that, if all be a dream, then he doth but\ndream that he makes the question, and so it is not much matter that a\nwaking man should answer him. But yet, if he pleases, he may dream that\nI make him this answer, That the certainty of things existing in RERUM\nNATURA when we have the testimony of our senses for it is not only as\ngreat as our frame can attain to, but as our condition needs. For,\nour faculties being suited not to the full extent of being, nor to a\nperfect, clear, comprehensive knowledge of things free from all doubt\nand scruple; but to the preservation of us, in whom they are; and\naccommodated to the use of life: they serve to our purpose well enough,\nif they will but give us certain notice of those things, which are\nconvenient or inconvenient to us. For he that sees a candle burning, and\nhath experimented the force of its flame by putting his finger in it,\nwill little doubt that this is something existing without him, which\ndoes him harm, and puts him to great pain: which is assurance enough,\nwhen no man requires greater certainty to govern his actions by than\nwhat is as certain as his actions themselves. And if our dreamer pleases\nto try whether the glowing heat of a glass furnace be barely a wandering\nimagination in a drowsy man's fancy, by putting his hand into it, he may\nperhaps be wakened into a certainty greater than he could wish, that it\nis something more than bare imagination. So that this evidence is as\ngreat as we can desire, being as certain to us as our pleasure or pain,\ni.e. happiness or misery; beyond which we have no concernment, either of\nknowing or being. Such an assurance of the existence of things without\nus is sufficient to direct us in the attaining the good and avoiding the\nevil which is caused by them, which is the important concernment we have\nof being made acquainted with them.\n9. But reaches no further than actual Sensation.\nIn fine, then, when our senses do actually convey into our\nunderstandings any idea, we cannot but be satisfied that there doth\nsomething AT THAT TIME really exist without us, which doth affect our\nsenses, and by them give notice of itself to our apprehensive faculties,\nand actually produce that idea which we then perceive: and we cannot\nso far distrust their testimony, as to doubt that such COLLECTIONS of\nsimple ideas as we have observed by our senses to be united together, do\nreally exist together. But this knowledge extends as far as the present\ntestimony of our senses, employed about particular objects that do then\naffect them, and no further. For if I saw such a collection of simple\nideas as is wont to be called MAN, existing together one minute since,\nand am now alone, I cannot be certain that the same man exists now,\nsince there is no NECESSARY CONNEXION of his existence a minute since\nwith his existence now: by a thousand ways he may cease to be, since I\nhad the testimony of my senses for his existence. And if I cannot be\ncertain that the man I saw last to-day is now in being, I can less be\ncertain that he is so who hath been longer removed from my senses, and I\nhave not seen since yesterday, or since the last year: and much less can\nI be certain of the existence of men that I never saw. And, therefore,\nthough it be highly probable that millions of men do now exist, yet,\nwhilst I am alone, writing this, I have not that certainty of it which\nwe strictly call knowledge; though the great likelihood of it puts me\npast doubt, and it be reasonable for me to do several things upon the\nconfidence that there are men (and men also of my acquaintance, with\nwhom I have to do) now in the world: but this is but probability, not\nknowledge.\n10. Folly to expect Demonstration in everything.\nWhereby yet we may observe how foolish and vain a thing it is for a\nman of a narrow knowledge, who having reason given him to judge of\nthe different evidence and probability of things, and to be swayed\naccordingly; how vain, I say, it is to expect demonstration and\ncertainty in things not capable of it; and refuse assent to very\nrational propositions, and act contrary to very plain and clear truths,\nbecause they cannot be made out so evident, as to surmount every the\nleast (I will not say reason, but) pretence of doubting. He that, in\nthe ordinary affairs of life, would admit of nothing but direct plain\ndemonstration, would be sure of nothing in this world, but of perishing\nquickly. The wholesomeness of his meat or drink would not give him\nreason to venture on it: and I would fain know what it is he could do\nupon such grounds as are capable of no doubt, no objection.\n11. Past Existence of other things is known by Memory.\nAs WHEN OUR SENSES ARE ACTUALLY EMPLOYED ABOUT ANY OBJECT, we do know\nthat it does exist; so BY OUR MEMORY we may be assured, that heretofore\nthings that affected our senses have existed. And thus we have knowledge\nof the past existence of several things, whereof our senses having\ninformed us, our memories still retain the ideas; and of this we are\npast all doubt, so long as we remember well. But this knowledge also\nreaches no further than our senses have formerly assured us. Thus,\nseeing water at this instant, it is an unquestionable truth to me that\nwater doth exist: and remembering that I saw it yesterday, it will also\nbe always true, and as long as my memory retains it always an undoubted\nproposition to me, that water did exist the 10th of July, 1688; as it\nwill also be equally true that a certain number of very fine colours did\nexist, which at the same time I saw upon a bubble of that water: but,\nbeing now quite out of sight both of the water and bubbles too, it is no\nmore certainly known to me that the water doth now exist, than that the\nbubbles or colours therein do so: it being no more necessary that water\nshould exist to-day, because it existed yesterday, than that the colours\nor bubbles exist to-day, because they existed yesterday, though it be\nexceedingly much more probable; because water hath been observed to\ncontinue long in existence, but bubbles, and the colours on them,\nquickly cease to be.\n12. The Existence of other finite Spirits not knowable, and rests on\nFaith.\nWhat ideas we have of spirits, and how we come by them, I have already\nshown. But though we have those ideas in our minds, and know we have\nthem there, the having the ideas of spirits does not make us know that\nany such things do exist without us, or that there are any finite\nspirits, or any other spiritual beings, but the Eternal God. We have\nground from revelation, and several other reasons, to believe with\nassurance that there are such creatures: but our senses not being\nable to discover them, we want the means of knowing their particular\nexistences. For we can no more know that there are finite spirits really\nexisting, by the idea we have of such beings in our minds, than by the\nideas any one has of fairies or centaurs, he can come to know that\nthings answering those ideas do really exist.\nAnd therefore concerning the existence of finite spirits, as well as\nseveral other things, we must content ourselves with the evidence of\nfaith; but universal, certain propositions concerning this matter\nare beyond our reach. For however true it may be, v.g., that all the\nintelligent spirits that God ever created do still exist, yet it\ncan never make a part of our certain knowledge. These and the like\npropositions we may assent to, as highly probable, but are not, I fear,\nin this state capable of knowing. We are not, then, to put others upon\ndemonstrating, nor ourselves upon search of universal certainty in all\nthose matters; wherein we are not capable of any other knowledge, but\nwhat our senses give us in this or that particular.\n13. Only particular Propositions concerning concrete Existances are\nknowable.\nBy which it appears that there are two sorts of propositions:--(1)\nThere is one sort of propositions concerning the existence of anything\nanswerable to such an idea: as having the idea of an elephant, phoenix,\nmotion, or an angel, in my mind, the first and natural inquiry is,\nWhether such a thing does anywhere exist? And this knowledge is only of\nparticulars. No existence of anything without us, but only of God, can\ncertainly be known further than our senses inform us, (2) There is\nanother sort of propositions, wherein is expressed the agreement or\ndisagreement of OUR ABSTRACT IDEAS, and their dependence on one another.\nSuch propositions may be universal and certain. So, having the idea of\nGod and myself, of fear and obedience, I cannot but be sure that God is\nto be feared and obeyed by me: and this proposition will be certain,\nconcerning man in general, if I have made an abstract idea of such a\nspecies, whereof I am one particular. But yet this proposition, how\ncertain soever, that 'men ought to fear and obey God' proves not to\nme the EXISTENCE of MEN in the world; but will be true of all such\ncreatures, whenever they do exist: which certainty of such general\npropositions depends on the agreement or disagreement to be discovered\nin those abstract ideas.\n14. And all general Propositions that are known to be true concern\nabstract Ideas.\nIn the former case, our knowledge is the consequence of the existence\nof things, producing ideas in our minds by our senses: in the latter,\nknowledge is the consequence of the ideas (be they what they will) that\nare in our minds, producing there general certain propositions. Many of\nthese are called AETERNAE VERITATES, and all of them indeed are so; not\nfrom being written, all or any of them, in the minds of all men; or that\nthey were any of them propositions in any one's mind, till he, having\ngot the abstract ideas, joined or separated them by affirmation or\nnegation. But wheresoever we can suppose such a creature as man is,\nendowed with such faculties, and thereby furnished with such ideas as we\nhave, we must conclude, he must needs, when he applies his thoughts to\nthe consideration of his ideas, know the truth of certain propositions\nthat will arise from the agreement or disagreement which he will\nperceive in his own ideas. Such propositions are therefore called\nETERNAL TRUTHS, not because they are eternal propositions actually\nformed, and antecedent to the understanding that at any time makes them;\nnor because they are imprinted on the mind from any patterns that are\nanywhere out of the mind, and existed before: but because, being once\nmade about abstract ideas, so as to be true, they will, whenever they\ncan be supposed to be made again at any time, past or come, by a mind\nhaving those ideas, always actually be true. For names being supposed\nto stand perpetually for the same ideas, and the same ideas having\nimmutably the same habitudes one to another, propositions concerning any\nabstract ideas that are once true must needs be ETERNAL VERITIES.\nCHAPTER XII. OF THE IMPROVEMENT OF OUR KNOWLEDGE\n1. Knowledge is not got from Maxims.\nIT having been the common received opinion amongst men of letters, that\nMAXIMS were the foundation of all knowledge; and that the sciences\nwere each of them built upon certain PRAECOGNITA, from whence the\nunderstanding was to take its rise, and by which it was to conduct\nitself in its inquiries into the matters belonging to that science, the\nbeaten road of the Schools has been, to lay down in the beginning one or\nmore GENERAL PROPOSITIONS, as foundations whereon to build the knowledge\nthat was to be had of that subject. These doctrines, thus laid down for\nfoundations of any science, were called PRINCIPLES, as the beginnings\nfrom which we must set out, and look no further backwards in our\ninquiries, as we have already observed.\n2. (The Occasion of that Opinion.)\nOne thing which might probably give an occasion to this way of\nproceeding in other sciences, was (as I suppose) the good success it\nseemed to have in MATHEMATICS, wherein men, being observed to attain a\ngreat certainty of knowledge, these sciences came by pre-eminence to\nbe called [word in Greek], and [word in Greek], learning, or things\nlearned, thoroughly learned, as having of all others the greatest\ncertainty, clearness, and evidence in them.\n3. But from comparing clear and distinct Ideas.\nBut if any one will consider, he will (I guess) find, that the great\nadvancement and certainty of real knowledge which men arrived to in\nthese sciences, was not owing to the influence of these principles, nor\nderived from any peculiar advantage they received from two or three\ngeneral maxims, laid down in the beginning; but from the clear,\ndistinct, complete ideas their thoughts were employed about, and the\nrelation of equality and excess so clear between some of them, that they\nhad an intuitive knowledge, and by THAT a way to discover it in others;\nand this without the help of those maxims. For I ask, Is it not possible\nfor a young lad to know that his whole body is bigger than his little\nfinger, but by virtue of this axiom, that THE WHOLE IS BIGGER THAN A\nPART; nor be assured of it, till he has learned that maxim? Or cannot a\ncountry wench know that, having received a shilling from one that owes\nher three, and a shilling also from another that owes her three, the\nremaining debts in each of their hands are equal? Cannot she know this,\nI say, unless she fetch the certainty of it from this maxim, that IF YOU\nTAKE EQUALS FROM EQUALS, THE REMAINDER WILL BE EQUALS, a maxim which\npossibly she never heard or thought of? I desire any one to consider,\nfrom what has been elsewhere said, which is known first and clearest by\nmost people, the particular instance, or the general rule; and which it\nis that gives life and birth to the other. These general rules are\nbut the comparing our more general and abstract ideas, which are the\nworkmanship of the mind, made, and names given to them for the easier\ndispatch in its reasonings, and drawing into comprehensive terms and\nshort rules its various and multiplied observations. But knowledge began\nin the mind, and was founded on particulars; though afterwards, perhaps,\nno notice was taken thereof: it being natural for the mind (forward\nstill to enlarge its knowledge) most attentively to lay up those general\nnotions, and make the proper use of them, which is to disburden the\nmemory of the cumbersome load of particulars. For I desire it may be\nconsidered, what more certainty there is to a child, or any one, that\nhis body, little finger, and all, is bigger than his little finger\nalone, after you have given to his body the name WHOLE, and to his\nlittle finger the name PART, than he could have had before; or what new\nknowledge concerning his body can these two relative terms give him,\nwhich he could not have without them? Could he not know that his body\nwas bigger than his little finger, if his language were yet so imperfect\nthat he had no such relative terms as whole and part? I ask, further,\nwhen he has got these names, how is he more certain that his body is a\nwhole, and his little finger a part, than he was or might be certain\nbefore he learnt those terms, that his body was bigger than his little\nfinger? Any one may as reasonably doubt or deny that his little finger\nis a part of his body, as that it is less than his body. And he that can\ndoubt whether it be less, will as certainly doubt whether it be a part.\nSo that the maxim, the whole is bigger than a part, can never be made\nuse of to prove the little finger less than the body, but when it is\nuseless, by being brought to convince one of a truth which he knows\nalready. For he that does not certainly know that any parcel of matter,\nwith another parcel of matter joined to it, is bigger than either of\nthem alone, will never be able to know it by the help of these two\nrelative terms, whole and part, make of them what maxim you please.\n4. Dangerous to build upon precarious Principles.\nBut be it in the mathematics as it will, whether it be clearer, that,\ntaking an inch from a black line of two inches, and an inch from a red\nline of two inches, the remaining parts of the two lines will be equal,\nor that IF YOU TAKE EQUALS FROM EQUALS, THE REMAINDER WILL BE EQUALS:\nwhich, I say, of these two is the clearer and first known, I leave to\nany one to determine, it not being material to my present occasion. That\nwhich I have here to do, is to inquire, whether, if it be the readiest\nway to knowledge to begin with general maxims, and build upon them, it\nbe yet a safe way to take the PRINCIPLES which are laid down in any\nother science as unquestionable truths; and so receive them without\nexamination, and adhere to them, without suffering them to be doubted\nof, because mathematicians have been so happy, or so fair, to use none\nbut self-evident and undeniable. If this be so, I know not what may not\npass for truth in morality, what may not be introduced and proved in\nnatural philosophy.\nLet that principle of some of the old philosophers, That all is Matter,\nand that there is nothing else, be received for certain and indubitable,\nand it will be easy to be seen by the writings of some that have revived\nit again in our days, what consequences it will lead us into. Let any\none, with Polemo, take the world; or with the Stoics, the aether, or\nthe sun; or with Anaximenes, the air, to be God; and what a divinity,\nreligion, and worship must we needs have! Nothing can be so dangerous as\nPRINCIPLES thus TAKEN UP WITHOUT QUESTIONING OR EXAMINATION; especially\nif they be such as concern morality, which influence men's lives, and\ngive a bias to all their actions. Who might not justly expect another\nkind of life in Aristippus, who placed happiness in bodily pleasure; and\nin Antisthenes, who made virtue sufficient to felicity? And he who, with\nPlato, shall place beatitude in the knowledge of God, will have his\nthoughts raised to other contemplations than those who look not beyond\nthis spot of earth, and those perishing things which are to be had in\nit. He that, with Archelaus, shall lay it down as a principle, that\nright and wrong, honest and dishonest, are defined only by laws, and not\nby nature, will have other measures of moral rectitude and gravity, than\nthose who take it for granted that we are under obligations antecedent\nto all human constitutions.\n5. To do so is no certain Way to Truth.\nIf, therefore, those that pass for PRINCIPLES are NOT CERTAIN, (which we\nmust have some way to know, that we may be able to distinguish them\nfrom those that are doubtful,) but are only made so to us by our blind\nassent, we are liable to be misled by them; and instead of being guided\ninto truth, we shall, by principles, be only confirmed in mistake and\nerror.\n6. But to compare clear, complete Ideas, under steady Names.\nBut since the knowledge of the certainty of principles, as well as\nof all other truths, depends only upon the perception we have of the\nagreement or disagreement of our ideas, the way to improve our knowledge\nis not, I am sure, blindly, and with an implicit faith, to receive and\nswallow principles; but is, I think, to get and fix in our minds clear,\ndistinct, and complete ideas, as far as they are to be had, and annex\nto them proper and constant names. And thus, perhaps, without any other\nprinciples, but BARELY CONSIDERING THOSE PERFECT IDEAS, and by COMPARING\nTHEM ONE WITH ANOTHER; finding their agreement and disagreement, and\ntheir several relations and habitudes; we shall get more true and clear\nknowledge by the conduct of this one rule, than by taking up principles,\nand thereby putting our minds into the disposal of others.\n7. The true Method of advancing Knowledge is by considering our abstract\nIdeas.\nWe must, therefore, if we will proceed as reason advises, adapt our\nmethods of inquiry to THE NATURE OF THE IDEAS WE EXAMINE, and the truth\nwe search after. General and certain truths are only founded in the\nhabitudes and relations of ABSTRACT IDEAS. A sagacious and methodical\napplication of our thoughts, for the finding out these relations, is\nthe only way to discover all that can be put with truth and certainty\nconcerning them into general propositions. By what steps we are to\nproceed in these, is to be learned in the schools of the mathematicians,\nwho, from very plain and easy beginnings, by gentle degrees, and\na continued chain of reasonings, proceed to the discovery and\ndemonstration of truths that appear at first sight beyond human\ncapacity. The art of finding proofs, and the admirable methods they have\ninvented for the singling out and laying in order those intermediate\nideas that demonstratively show the equality or inequality of\nunapplicable quantities, is that which has carried them so far, and\nproduced such wonderful and unexpected discoveries: but whether\nsomething like this, in respect of other ideas, as well as those of\nmagnitude, may not in time be found out, I will not determine. This,\nI think, I may say, that if other ideas that are the real as well as\nnominal essences of their species, were pursued in the way familiar to\nmathematicians, they would carry our thoughts further, and with greater\nevidence and clearness than possibly we are apt to imagine.\n8. By which Morality also may be made clearer.\nThis gave me the confidence to advance that conjecture, which I suggest,\n(chap. iii.) viz. that MORALITY is capable of demonstration as well as\nmathematics. For the ideas that ethics are conversant about, being all\nreal essences, and such as I imagine have a discoverable connexion and\nagreement one with another; so far as we can find their habitudes and\nrelations, so far we shall be possessed of certain, real, and general\ntruths; and I doubt not but, if a right method were taken, a great part\nof morality might be made out with that clearness, that could leave, to\na considering man, no more reason to doubt, than he could have to\ndoubt of the truth of propositions in mathematics, which have been\ndemonstrated to him.\n9. Our Knowledge of Substances is to be improved, not by contemplation\nof abstract ideas, but only by Experience.\nIn our search after the knowledge of SUBSTANCES, our want of ideas that\nare suitable to such a way of proceeding obliges us to a quite different\nmethod. We advance not here, as in the other, (where our abstract ideas\nare real as well as nominal essences,) by contemplating our ideas, and\nconsidering their relations and correspondences; that helps us very\nlittle for the reasons, that in another place we have at large set down.\nBy which I think it is evident, that substances afford matter of very\nlittle GENERAL knowledge; and the bare contemplation of their abstract\nideas will carry us but a very little way in the search of truth and\ncertainty. What, then, are we to do for the improvement of our knowledge\nin substantial beings? Here we are to take a quite contrary course: the\nwant of ideas of their real essences sends us from our own thoughts to\nthe things themselves as they exist. EXPERIENCE HERE MUST TEACH ME WHAT\nREASON CANNOT: and it is by TRYING alone, that I can CERTAINLY KNOW,\nwhat other qualities co-exist with those of my complex idea, v.g.\nwhether that yellow heavy, fusible body I call gold, be malleable, or\nno; which experience (which way ever it prove in that particular body I\nexamine) makes me not certain, that it is so in all, or any other\nyellow, heavy, fusible bodies, but that which I have tried. Because it\nis no consequence one way or the other from my complex idea: the\nnecessity or inconsistence of malleability hath no visible connexion\nwith the combination of that colour, weight, and fusibility in any body.\nWhat I have said here of the nominal essence of gold, supposed to\nconsist of a body of such a determinate colour, weight, and fusibility,\nwill hold true, if malleableness, fixedness, and solubility in aqua\nregia be added to it. Our reasonings from these ideas will carry us but\na little way in the certain discovery of the other properties in those\nmasses of matter wherein all these are to be found. Because the OTHER\nproperties of such bodies, depending not on these, but on that unknown\nreal essence on which these also depend, we cannot by them discover the\nrest; we can go no further than the simple ideas of our nominal essence\nwill carry us, which is very little beyond themselves; and so afford us\nbut very sparingly any certain, universal, and useful truths. For, upon\ntrial, having found that particular piece (and all others of that\ncolour, weight, and fusibility, that I ever tried) malleable, that also\nmakes now, perhaps, a part of my complex idea, part of my nominal\nessence of gold: whereby though I make my complex idea to which I affix\nthe name gold, to consist of more simple ideas than before; yet still,\nit not containing the real essence of any species of bodies, it helps me\nnot certainly to know (I say to know, perhaps it may be to conjecture)\nthe other remaining properties of that body, further than they have a\nvisible connexion with some or all of the simple ideas that make up my\nnominal essence. For example, I cannot be certain, from this complex\nidea, whether gold be fixed or no; because, as before, there is no\nNECESSARY connexion or inconsistence to be discovered betwixt a COMPLEX\nIDEA OF A BODY YELLOW, HEAVY, FUSIBLE, MALLEABLE; betwixt these, I say,\nand FIXEDNESS; so that I may certainly know, that in whatsoever body\nthese are found, there fixedness is sure to be. Here, again, for\nassurance, I must apply myself to experience; as far as that reaches,\nI may have certain knowledge, but no further.\n10. Experience may procure is Convenience, not Science.\nI deny not but a man, accustomed to rational and regular experiments,\nshall be able to see further into the nature of bodies, and guess\nrighter at their yet unknown properties, than one that is a stranger to\nthem: but yet, as I have said, this is but judgment and opinion, not\nknowledge and certainty. This way of GETTING AND IMPROVING OUR KNOWLEDGE\nIN SUBSTANCES ONLY BY EXPERIENCE AND HISTORY, which is all that the\nweakness of our faculties in this state of mediocrity which we are in\nthis world can attain to, makes me suspect that NATURAL PHILOSOPHY IS\nNOT CAPABLE IS BEING MADE A SCIENCE. We are able, I imagine, to reach\nvery little general knowledge concerning the species of bodies, and\ntheir several properties. Experiments and historical observations we may\nhave, from which we may draw advantages of ease and health, and thereby\nincrease our stock of conveniences for this life; but beyond this I fear\nour talents reach not, nor are our faculties, as I guess, able to\nadvance.\n11. We are fitted for moral Science, but only for probable\ninterpretations of external Nature.\nFrom whence is it obvious to conclude, that, since our faculties are\nnot fitted to penetrate into the internal fabric and real essences of\nbodies; but yet plainly discover to us the being of a God, and the\nknowledge of ourselves, enough to lead us into a full and clear\ndiscovery of our duty and great concernment; it will become us, as\nrational creatures, to employ those faculties we have about what they\nare most adapted to, and follow the direction of nature, where it seems\nto point us out the way. For it is rational to conclude, that our proper\nemployment lies in those inquiries, and in that sort of knowledge which\nis most suited to our natural capacities, and carries in it our greatest\ninterest, i.e. the condition of our eternal estate. Hence I think I may\nconclude, that MORALITY IS THE PROPER SCIENCE AND BUSINESS OF MANKIND IN\nGENERAL, (who are both concerned and fitted to search out their SUMMUM\nBONUM;) as several arts, conversant about several parts of nature, are\nthe lot and private talent of particular men, for the common use of\nhuman life, and their own particular subsistence in this world. Of what\nconsequence the discovery of one natural body and its properties may\nbe to human life, the whole great continent of America is a convincing\ninstance: whose ignorance in useful arts, and want of the greatest part\nof the conveniences of life, in a country that abounded with all sorts\nof natural plenty, I think may be attributed to their ignorance of what\nwas to be found in a very ordinary, despicable stone, I mean the mineral\nof IRON. And whatever we think of our parts or improvements in this part\nof the world, where knowledge and plenty seem to vie with each other;\nyet to any one that will seriously reflect on it, I suppose it will\nappear past doubt, that, were the use of iron lost among us, we should\nin a few ages be unavoidably reduced to the wants and ignorance of the\nancient savage Americans, whose natural endowments and provisions come\nno way short of those of the most flourishing and polite nations. So\nthat he who first made known the use of that contemptible mineral, may\nbe truly styled the father of arts, and author of plenty.\n12. In the study of Nature we must beware of Hypotheses and wrong\nPrinciples.\nI would not, therefore, be thought to disesteem or dissuade the study of\nNATURE. I readily agree the contemplation of his works gives us occasion\nto admire, revere, and glorify their Author: and, if rightly directed,\nmay be of greater benefit to mankind than the monuments of exemplary\ncharity that have at so great charge been raised by the founders of\nhospitals and almshouses. He that first invented printing, discovered\nthe use of the compass, or made public the virtue and right use of KIN\nKINA, did more for the propagation of knowledge, for the supply and\nincrease of useful commodities, and saved more from the grave than those\nwho built colleges, workhouses, and hospitals. All that I would say\nis, that we should not be too forwardly possessed with the opinion or\nexpectation of knowledge, where it is not to be had, or by ways that\nwill not attain to it: that we should not take doubtful systems\nfor complete sciences; nor unintelligible notions for scientifical\ndemonstrations. In the knowledge of bodies, we must be content to\nglean what we can from particular experiments: since we cannot, from a\ndiscovery of their real essences, grasp at a time whole sheaves, and in\nbundles comprehend the nature and properties of whole species together.\nWhere our inquiry is concerning co-existence, or repugnancy to\nco-exist, which by contemplation of our ideas we cannot discover; there\nexperience, observation, and natural history, must give us, by our\nsenses and by retail, an insight into corporeal substances. The\nknowledge of BODIES we must get by our senses, warily employed in taking\nnotice of their qualities and operations on one another: and what we\nhope to know of SEPARATE SPIRITS in this world, we must, I think, expect\nonly from revelation. He that shall consider how little general maxims,\nprecarious principles, and hypotheses laid down at pleasure, have\npromoted true knowledge, or helped to satisfy the inquiries of rational\nmen after real improvements; how little, I say, the setting out at that\nend has, for many ages together, advanced men's progress, towards the\nknowledge of natural philosophy, Will think we have reason to thank\nthose who in this latter age have taken another course, and have trod\nout to us, though not an easier way to learned ignorance, yet a surer\nway to profitable knowledge.\n13. The true Use of Hypotheses.\nNot that we may not, to explain any phenomena of nature, make use of any\nprobable hypothesis whatsoever: hypotheses, if they are well made,\nare at least great helps to the memory, and often direct us to new\ndiscoveries. But my meaning is, that we should not take up any one too\nhastily (which the mind, that would always penetrate into the causes of\nthings, and have principles to rest on, is very apt to do) till we have\nvery well examined particulars, and made several experiments, in that\nthing which we would explain by our hypothesis, and see whether it will\nagree to them all; whether our principles will carry us quite through,\nand not be as inconsistent with one phenomenon of nature, as they seem\nto accommodate and explain another. And at least that we take care that\nthe name of PRINCIPLES deceive us not, nor impose on us, by making us\nreceive that for an unquestionable truth, which is really at best but a\nvery doubtful conjecture; such as are most (I had almost said all) of\nthe hypotheses in natural philosophy.\n14. Clear and distinct Ideas with settled Names, and the finding of\nthose intermediate ideas which show their Agreement or Disagreement, are\nthe Ways to enlarge our Knowledge.\nBut whether natural philosophy be capable of certainty or no, the ways\nto enlarge our knowledge, as far as we are capable, seems to me, in\nshort, to be these two:--\nFirst, The first is to get and settle in our minds [determined ideas of\nthose things whereof we have general or specific names; at least, so\nmany of them as we would consider and improve our knowledge in, or\nreason about.] [And if they be specific ideas of substances, we should\nendeavour also to make them as complete as we can, whereby I mean,\nthat we should put together as many simple ideas as, being constantly\nobserved to co-exist, may perfectly determine the species; and each of\nthose simple ideas which are the ingredients of our complex ones, should\nbe clear and distinct in our minds.] For it being evident that our\nknowledge cannot exceed our ideas; [as far as] they are either\nimperfect, confused, or obscure, we cannot expect to have certain,\nperfect, or clear knowledge. Secondly, The other is the art of finding\nout those intermediate ideas, which may show us the agreement or\nrepugnancy of other ideas, which cannot be immediately compared.\n15. Mathematics an instance of this.\nThat these two (and not the relying on maxims, and drawing consequences\nfrom some general propositions) are the right methods of improving our\nknowledge in the ideas of other modes besides those of quantity, the\nconsideration of mathematical knowledge will easily inform us. Where\nfirst we shall find that he that has not a perfect and clear idea of\nthose angles or figures of which he desires to know anything, is utterly\nthereby incapable of any knowledge about them. Suppose but a man not to\nhave a perfect exact idea of a right angle, a scalenum, or trapezium,\nand there is nothing more certain than that he will in vain seek any\ndemonstration about them. Further, it is evident, that it was not the\ninfluence of those maxims which are taken for principles in mathematics,\nthat hath led the masters of that science into those wonderful\ndiscoveries they have made. Let a man of good parts know all the maxims\ngenerally made use of in mathematics ever so perfectly, and contemplate\ntheir extent and consequences as much as he pleases, he will, by their\nassistance, I suppose, scarce ever come to know that the square of the\nhypothenuse in a right-angled triangle is equal to the squares of the\ntwo other sides. The knowledge that 'the whole is equal to all its\nparts,' and 'if you take equals from equals, the remainder will be\nequal,' &c., helped him not, I presume, to this demonstration: and a man\nmay, I think, pore long enough on those axioms, without ever seeing one\njot the more of mathematical truths. They have been discovered by the\nthoughts otherwise applied: the mind had other objects, other views\nbefore it, far different from those maxims, when it first got the\nknowledge of such truths in mathematics, which men, well enough\nacquainted with those received axioms, but ignorant of their method who\nfirst made these demonstrations, can never sufficiently admire. And who\nknows what methods to enlarge our knowledge in other parts of science\nmay hereafter be invented, answering that of algebra in mathematics,\nwhich so readily finds out the ideas of quantities to measure others\nby; whose equality or proportion we could otherwise very hardly, or,\nperhaps, never come to know?\nCHAPTER XIII.\nSOME FURTHER CONSIDERATIONS CONCERNING OUR KNOWLEDGE.\n1. Our Knowledge partly necessary partly voluntary.\nOur knowledge, as in other things, so in this, has so great a conformity\nwith our sight, that it is neither wholly necessary, nor wholly\nvoluntary. If our knowledge were altogether necessary, all men's\nknowledge would not only be alike, but every man would know all that is\nknowable; and if it were wholly voluntary, some men so little regard or\nvalue it, that they would have extreme little, or none at all. Men that\nhave senses cannot choose but receive some ideas by them; and if they\nhave memory, they cannot but retain some of them; and if they have\nany distinguishing faculty, cannot but perceive the agreement or\ndisagreement of some of them one with another; as he that has eyes, if\nhe will open them by day, cannot but see some objects, and perceive a\ndifference in them. But though a man with his eyes open in the light,\ncannot but see, yet there be certain objects which he may choose whether\nhe will turn his eyes to; there may be in his reach a book containing\npictures and discourses, capable to delight or instruct him, which yet\nhe may never have the will to open, never take the pains to look into.\n2. The application of our Faculties voluntary; but they being employed,\nwe know as things are, not as we please.\nThere is also another thing in a man's power, and that is, though he\nturns his eyes sometimes towards an object, yet he may choose whether he\nwill curiously survey it, and with an intent application endeavour to\nobserve accurately all that is visible in it. But yet, what he does see,\nhe cannot see otherwise than he does. It depends not on his will to see\nthat black which appears yellow; nor to persuade himself, that what\nactually scalds him, feels cold. The earth will not appear painted with\nflowers, nor the fields covered with verdure, whenever he has a mind to\nit: in the cold winter, he cannot help seeing it white and hoary, if he\nwill look abroad. Just thus is it with our understanding: all that is\nvoluntary in our knowledge is, the employing or withholding any of our\nFACULTIES from this or that sort of objects, and a more or less accurate\nsurvey of them: but, THEY BEING EMPLOYED, OUR WILL HATH NO POWER TO\nDETERMINE THE KNOWLEDGE OF THE MIND ONE WAY OR ANOTHER; that is done\nonly by the objects themselves, as far as they are clearly discovered.\nAnd therefore, as far as men's senses are conversant about external\nobjects, the mind cannot but receive those ideas which are presented by\nthem, and be informed of the existence of things without: and so far as\nmen's thoughts converse with their own determined ideas, they cannot\nbut in some measure observe the agreement or disagreement that is to be\nfound amongst some of them, which is so far knowledge: and if they have\nnames for those ideas which they have thus considered, they must needs\nbe assured of the truth of those propositions which express that\nagreement or disagreement they perceive in them, and be undoubtedly\nconvinced of those truths. For what a man sees, he cannot but see; and\nwhat he perceives, he cannot but know that he perceives.\n3. Instance in Numbers.\nThus he that has got the ideas of numbers, and hath taken the pains to\ncompare one, two, and three, to six, cannot choose but know that they\nare equal: he that hath got the idea of a triangle, and found the ways\nto measure its angles and their magnitudes, is certain that its three\nangles are equal to two right ones; and can as little doubt of that, as\nof this truth, that, It is impossible for the same thing to be, and not\nto be.\n4. Instance in Natural Religion.\nHe also that hath the idea of an intelligent, but frail and weak being,\nmade by and depending on another, who is eternal, omnipotent, perfectly\nwise and good, will as certainly know that man is to honour, fear, and\nobey God, as that the sun shines when he sees it. For if he hath but the\nideas of two such beings in his mind, and will turn his thoughts that\nway, and consider them, he will as certainly find that the inferior,\nfinite, and dependent, is under an obligation to obey the supreme and\ninfinite, as he is certain to find that three, four, and seven are less\nthan fifteen; if he will consider and compute those numbers: nor can he\nbe surer in a clear morning that the sun is risen; if he will but open\nhis eyes, and turn them that way. But yet these truths, being ever so\ncertain, ever so clear, he may be ignorant of either, or all of them,\nwho will never take the pains to employ his faculties, as he should, to\ninform himself about them.\nCHAPTER XIV. OF JUDGMENT.\n1. Our Knowledge being short, we want something else.\nThe understanding faculties being given to man, not barely for\nspeculation, but also for the conduct of his life, man would be at a\ngreat loss if he had nothing to direct him but what has the certainty of\ntrue knowledge. For that being very short and scanty, as we have seen,\nhe would be often utterly in the dark, and in most of the actions of his\nlife, perfectly at a stand, had he nothing to guide him in the absence\nof clear and certain knowledge. He that will not eat till he has\ndemonstration that it will nourish him; he that will not stir till he\ninfallibly knows the business he goes about will succeed, will have\nlittle else to do but to sit still and perish.\n2. What Use to be made of this twilight State.\nTherefore, as God has set some things in broad daylight; as he has given\nus some certain knowledge, though limited to a few things in comparison,\nprobably as a taste of what intellectual creatures are capable of to\nexcite in us a desire and endeavour after a better state: so, in the\ngreatest part of our concernments, he has afforded us only the twilight,\nas I may so say, of probability; suitable, I presume, to that state of\nmediocrity and probationership he has been pleased to place us in here;\nwherein, to check our over-confidence and presumption, we might, by\nevery day's experience, be made sensible of our short-sightedness and\nliableness to error; the sense whereof might be a constant admonition to\nus, to spend the days of this our pilgrimage with industry and care, in\nthe search and following of that way which might lead us to a state\nof greater perfection. It being highly rational to think, even were\nrevelation silent in the case, that, as men employ those talents God has\ngiven them here, they shall accordingly receive their rewards at the\nclose of the day, when their sun shall set, and night shall put an end\nto their labours.\n3. Judgement or assent to Probability, supplies our want of Knowledge.\nThe faculty which God has given man to supply the want of clear and\ncertain knowledge, in cases where that cannot be had, is JUDGEMENT:\nwhereby the mind takes its ideas to agree or disagree; or, which is\nthe same, any proposition to be true or false, without perceiving a\ndemonstrative evidence in the proofs. The mind sometimes exercises\nthis judgment out of necessity, where demonstrative proofs and\ncertain knowledge are not to be had; and sometimes out of laziness,\nunskilfulness, or haste, even where demonstrative and certain proofs\nare to be had. Men often stay not warily to examine the agreement or\ndisagreement of two ideas, which they are desirous or concerned to know;\nbut, either incapable of such attention as is requisite in a long train\nof gradations, or impatient of delay, lightly cast their eyes on, or\nwholly pass by the proofs; and so, without making out the demonstration,\ndetermine of the agreement or disagreement of two ideas, as it were by a\nview of them as they are at a distance, and take it to be the one or\nthe other, as seems most likely to them upon such a loose survey. This\nfaculty of the mind, when it is exercised immediately about things, is\ncalled JUDGEMENT; when about truths delivered in words, is most commonly\ncalled ASSENT or DISSENT: which being the most usual way, wherein the\nmind has occasion to employ this faculty, I shall, under these terms,\ntreat of it, as feast liable in our language to equivocation.\n4. Judgement is the presuming Things to be so, without perceiving it.\nThus the mind has two faculties conversant (about truth and falsehood):--\nFirst, KNOWLEDGE, whereby it certainly PERCEIVES, and is undoubtedly\nsatisfied of the agreement or disagreement of any ideas.\nSecondly, JUDGEMENT, which is the putting ideas together, or separating\nthem from one another in the mind, when their certain agreement or\ndisagreement is not perceived, but PRESUMED to be so; which is, as the\nword imports, taken to be so before it certainly appears. And if it\nso unites or separates them as in reality things are, it is right\njudgement.\nCHAPTER XV. OF PROBABILITY.\n1. Probability is the appearance of Agreement upon fallible Proofs.\nAs DEMONSTRATION is the showing the agreement or disagreement of two\nideas, by the intervention of one or more proofs, which have a constant,\nimmutable, and visible connexion one with another; so PROBABILITY is\nnothing but the appearance of such an agreement or disagreement, by the\nintervention of proofs, whose connexion is not constant and immutable,\nor at least is not perceived to be so, but is, or appears for the most\npart to be so, and is enough to induce the mind to judge the proposition\nto be true or false, rather than the contrary. For example: in the\ndemonstration of it a man perceives the certain, immutable connexion\nthere is of equality between the three angles of a triangle, and those\nintermediate ones which are made use of to show their equality to two\nright ones; and so, by an intuitive knowledge of the agreement or\ndisagreement of the intermediate ideas in each step of the progress,\nthe whole series is continued with an evidence, which clearly shows the\nagreement or disagreement of those three angles in equality to two right\nones: and thus he has certain knowledge that it is so. But another\nman, who never took the pains to observe the demonstration, hearing a\nmathematician, a man of credit, affirm the three angles of a triangle to\nbe equal to two right ones, assents to it, i.e. receives it for true: in\nwhich case the foundation of his assent is the probability of the thing;\nthe proof being such as for the most part carries truth with it: the man\non whose testimony he receives it, not being wont to affirm anything\ncontrary to or besides his knowledge, especially in matters of this\nkind: so that that which causes his assent to this proposition, that the\nthree angles of a triangle are equal to two right ones, that which makes\nhim take these ideas to agree, without knowings them to do so, is the\nwonted veracity of the speaker in other cases, or his supposed veracity\nin this.\n2. It is to supply our Want of Knowledge.\nOur knowledge, as has been shown, being very narrow, and we not happy\nenough to find certain truth in everything which we have occasion to\nconsider; most of the propositions we think, reason, discourse--nay, act\nupon, are such as we cannot have undoubted knowledge of their truth:\nyet some of them border so near upon certainty, that we make no act,\naccording to the assent, as resolutely as if they were infallibly\ndemonstrated, and that our knowledge of them was perfect and certain.\nBut there being degrees herein, from the very neighbourhood of certainty\nand demonstration, quite down to improbability and unlikeness, even to\nthe confines of impossibility; and also degrees of assent from full\nassurance and confidence, quite down to conjecture, doubt, and distrust:\nI shall come now, (having, as I think, found out THE BOUNDS OF HUMAN\nKNOWLEDGE AND CERTAINTY,) in the next place, to consider THE SEVERAL\nDEGREES AND GROUNDS OF PROBABILITY, AND ASSENT OR FAITH.\n3. Being that which makes us presume Things to be true, before we know\nthem to be so.\nProbability is likeliness to be true, the very notation of the word\nsignifying such a proposition, for which there be arguments or proofs to\nmake it pass, or be received for true. The entertainment the mind gives\nthis sort of propositions is called BELIEF, ASSENT, or OPINION, which is\nthe admitting or receiving any proposition for true, upon arguments or\nproofs that are found to persuade us to receive it as true, without\ncertain knowledge that it is so. And herein lies the difference between\nPROBABILITY and CERTAINTY, FAITH, and KNOWLEDGE, that in all the parts\nof knowledge there is intuition; each immediate idea, each step has its\nvisible and certain connexion: in belief, not so. That which makes me\nbelieve, is something extraneous to the thing I believe; something not\nevidently joined on both sides to, and so not manifestly showing the\nagreement or disagreement of those ideas that are under consideration.\n4. The Grounds of Probability are two: Conformity with our own\nExperience, or the Testimony of others.\nProbability then, being to supply the defect of our knowledge, and to\nguide us where that fails, is always conversant about propositions\nwhereof we have no certainty, but only some inducements to receive them\nfor true. The grounds of it are, in short, these two following:--\nFirst, The conformity of anything with our own knowledge, observation,\nand experience.\nSecondly, The testimony of others, vouching their observation and\nexperience. In the testimony of others is to be considered: 1. The\nnumber. 2. The integrity. 3. The skill of the witnesses. 4. The design\nof the author, where it is a testimony out of a book cited. 5. The\nconsistency of the parts, and circumstances of the relation. 6. Contrary\ntestimonies.\n5. In this, all the Arguments pro and con ought to be examined, before\nwe come to a Judgment.\nProbability wanting that intuitive evidence which, infallibly determines\nthe understanding and produces certain knowledge, the mind, if it WILL\nPROCEED RATIONALLY, ought to examine all the grounds of probability, and\nsee how they make more or less for or against any proposition, before\nit assents to or dissents from it; and, upon a due balancing the whole,\nreject or receive it, with a more or less firm assent, proportionably to\nthe preponderancy of the greater grounds of probability on one side or\nthe other. For example:--\nIf I myself see a man walk on the ice, it is past probability; it is\nknowledge. But if another tells me he saw a man in England, in the midst\nof a sharp winter, walk upon water hardened with cold, this has so great\nconformity with what is usually observed to happen, that I am disposed\nby the natures of the thing itself to assent to it; unless some manifest\nsuspicion attend the relation of that matter of fact. But if the same\nthing be told to one born between the tropics, who never saw nor\nheard of any such thing before, there the whole probability relies on\ntestimony: and as the relators are more in number, and of more credit,\nand have no interest to speak contrary to the truth, so that matter\nof fact is like to find more or less belief. Though to a man whose\nexperience has always been quite contrary, and who has never heard of\nanything like it, the most untainted credit of a witness will scarce\nbe able to find belief. As it happened to a Dutch ambassador, who\nentertaining the king of Siam with the particularities of Holland, which\nhe was inquisitive after, amongst other things told him, that the water\nin his country would sometimes, in cold weather, be so hard, that men\nwalked upon it, and that it would bear an elephant, if he were there. To\nwhich the king replied, HITHERTO _I_ HAVE BELIEVED THE STRANGE THINGS\nYOU HAVE TOLD ME, BECAUSE _I_ LOOK UPON YOU AS A SOBER FAIR MAN, BUT NOW\n_I_ AM SURE YOU LIE.\n6. Probable arguments capable of great Variety.\nUpon these grounds depends the probability of any proposition: and as\nthe conformity of our knowledge, as the certainty of observations,\nas the frequency and constancy of experience, and the number and\ncredibility of testimonies do more or less agree or disagree with it, so\nis any proposition in itself more or less probable. There is another, I\nconfess, which, though by itself it be no true ground of probability,\nyet is often made use of for one, by which men most commonly regulate\ntheir assent, and upon which they pin their faith more than anything\nelse, and that is, THE OPINION OF OTHERS; though there cannot be a more\ndangerous thing to rely on, nor more likely to mislead one; since there\nis much more falsehood and error among men, than truth and knowledge.\nAnd if the opinions and persuasions of others, whom we know and think\nwell of, be a ground of assent, men have reason to be Heathens in Japan,\nMahometans in Turkey, Papists in Spain, Protestants in England, and\nLutherans in Sweden. But of this wrong ground of assent I shall have\noccasion to speak more at large in another place.\nCHAPTER XVI. OF THE DEGREES OF ASSENT.\n1. Our Assent ought to be regulated by the Grounds of Probability.\nThe grounds of probability we have laid down in the foregoing chapter:\nas they are the foundations on which our ASSENT is built, so are they\nalso the measure whereby its several degrees are, or ought to be\nregulated: only we are to take notice, that, whatever grounds of\nprobability there may be, they yet operate no further on the mind which\nsearches after truth, and endeavours to judge right, than they appear;\nat least, in the first judgment or search that the mind makes. I\nconfess, in the opinions men have, and firmly stick to in the world,\ntheir assent is not always from an actual view of the reasons that at\nfirst prevailed with them: it being in many cases almost impossible, and\nin most, very hard, even for those who have very admirable memories, to\nretain all the proofs which, upon a due examination, made them embrace\nthat side of the question. It suffices that they have once with care\nand fairness sifted the matter as far as they could; and that they have\nsearched into all the particulars, that they could imagine to give any\nlight to the question; and, with the best of their skill, cast up the\naccount upon the whole evidence: and thus, having once found on which\nside the probability appeared to THEM, after as full and exact an\ninquiry as they can make, they lay up the conclusion in their memories,\nas a truth they have discovered; and for the future they remain\nsatisfied with the testimony of their memories, that this is the opinion\nthat, by the proofs they have once seen of it, deserves such a degree of\ntheir assent as they afford it.\n2. These can not always be actually in View; and then we must content\nourselves with the remembrance that we once saw ground for such a Degree\nof Assent.\nThis is all that the greatest part of men are capable of doing, in\nregulating their opinions and judgments; unless a man will exact of\nthem, either to retain distinctly in their memories all the proofs\nconcerning any probable truth, and that too, in the same order, and\nregular deduction of consequences in which they have formerly placed\nor seen them; which sometimes is enough to fill a large volume on one\nsingle question: or else they must require a man, for every opinion that\nhe embraces, every day to examine the proofs: both which are impossible.\nIt is unavoidable, therefore, that the memory be relied on in the case,\nand that men be persuaded of several opinions, whereof the proofs are\nnot actually in their thoughts; nay, which perhaps they are not able\nactually to recall. Without this, the greatest part of men must be\neither very sceptics; or change every moment, and yield themselves up\nto whoever, having lately studied the question, offers them arguments,\nwhich, for want of memory, they are not able presently to answer.\n3. The ill consequence of this, if our former Judgments were not rightly\nmade.\nI cannot but own, that men's sticking to their past judgment, and\nadhering firmly to conclusions formerly made, is often the cause of\ngreat obstinacy in error and mistake. But the fault is not that they\nrely on their memories for what they have before well judged, but\nbecause they judged before they had well examined. May we not find a\ngreat number (not to say the greatest part) of men that think they have\nformed right judgments of several matters; and that for no other reason,\nbut because they never thought otherwise? that themselves to have judged\nright, only because they never questioned, never examined, their own\nopinions? Which is indeed to think they judged right, because they never\njudged at all. And yet these, of all men, hold their opinions with the\ngreatest stiffness; those being generally the most fierce and firm in\ntheir tenets, who have least examined them. What we once KNOW, we are\ncertain is so: and we may be secure, that there are no latent proofs\nundiscovered, which may overturn our knowledge, or bring it in doubt.\nBut, in matters of PROBABILITY, it is not in every case we can be sure\nthat we have all the particulars before us, that any way concern the\nquestion; and that there is no evidence behind, and yet unseen, which\nmay cast the probability on the other side, and outweigh all that at\npresent seems to preponderate with us. Who almost is there that hath\nthe leisure, patience, and means to collect together all the proofs\nconcerning most of the opinions he has, so as safely to conclude that he\nhath a clear and full view; and that there is no more to be alleged for\nhis better information? And yet we are forced to determine ourselves on\nthe one side or other. The conduct of our lives, and the management of\nour great concerns, will not bear delay: for those depend, for the most\npart, on the determination of our judgment in points wherein we are\nnot capable of certain and demonstrative knowledge, and wherein it is\nnecessary for us to embrace the one side or the other.\n4. The right Use of it, mutual Charity and Forbearance, in a necessary\ndiversity of opinions.\nSince, therefore, it is unavoidable to the greatest part of men, if not\nall, to have several OPINIONS, without certain and indubitable proofs\nof their truth; and it carries too great an imputation of ignorance,\nlightness, or folly for men to quit and renounce their former tenets\npresently upon the offer of an argument which they cannot immediately\nanswer, and show the insufficiency of: it would, methinks, become\nall men to maintain peace, and the common offices of humanity, and\nfriendship, in the diversity of opinions; since we cannot reasonably\nexpect that any one should readily and obsequiously quit his own\nopinion, and embrace ours, with a blind resignation to an authority\nwhich the understanding of man acknowledges not. For however it may\noften mistake, it can own no other guide but reason, nor blindly submit\nto the will and dictates of another. If he you would bring over to your\nsentiments be one that examines before he assents, you must give him\nleave at his leisure to go over the account again, and, recalling what\nis out of his mind, examine all the particulars, to see on which side\nthe advantage lies: and if he will not think our arguments of weight\nenough to engage him anew in so much pains, it is but what we often do\nourselves in the like case; and we should take it amiss if others should\nprescribe to us what points we should study. And if he be one who takes\nhis opinions upon trust, how can we imagine that he should renounce\nthose tenets which time and custom have so settled in his mind, that he\nthinks them self-evident, and of an unquestionably certainty; or which\nhe takes to be impressions he has received from God himself, or from men\nsent by him? How can we expect, I say, that opinions thus settled should\nbe given up to the arguments or authority of a stranger or adversary,\nespecially if there be any suspicion of interest or design, as there\nnever fails to be, where men find themselves ill-trusted? We should do\nwell to commiserate our mutual ignorance, and endeavour to remove it in\nall the gentle and fair ways of information; and not instantly treat\nothers ill, as obstinate and perverse, because they will not renounce\ntheir own, and receive our opinions, or at least those we would force\nupon them, when it is more than probable that we are no less obstinate\nin not embracing some of theirs. For where is the man that has\nincontestable evidence of the truth of all that he holds, or of the\nfalsehood of all he condemns; or can say that he has examined to the\nbottom all his own, or other men's opinions? The necessity of believing\nwithout knowledge, nay often upon very slight grounds, in this fleeting\nstate of action and blindness we are in, should make us more busy and\ncareful to inform ourselves than constrain others. At least, those who\nhave not thoroughly examined to the bottom all their own tenets, must\nconfess they are unfit to prescribe to others; and are unreasonable in\nimposing that as truth on other men's belief, which they themselves have\nnot searched into, nor weighed the arguments of probability, on which\nthey should receive or reject it. Those who have fairly and truly\nexamined, and are thereby got past doubt in all the doctrines they\nprofess and govern themselves by, would have a juster pretence to\nrequire others to follow them: but these are so few in number, and find\nso little reason to be magisterial in their opinions, that nothing\ninsolent and imperious is to be expected from them: and there is reason\nto think, that, if men were better instructed themselves, they would be\nless imposing on others.\n5. Probability is either of sensible Matter of Fact, capable of human\ntestimony, or of what is beyond the evidence of our senses.\nBut to return to the grounds of assent, and the several degrees of it,\nwe are to take notice, that the propositions we receive upon inducements\nof PROBABILITY are of TWO SORTS: either concerning some particular\nexistance, or, as it is usually termed, matter of fact, which, falling\nunder observation, is capable of human testimony; or else concerning\nthings, which being beyond the discovery of our senses, are not capable\nof any such testimony.\n6. Concerning the FIRST of these, viz. PARTICULAR MATTER OF FACT.\nI. The concurrent Experience of ALL other Men with ours, produces\nAssurance approaching to Knowledge.\nWhere any particular thing, consonant to the constant observation of\nourselves and others in the like case, comes attested by the concurrent\nreports of all that mention it, we receive it as easily, and build as\nfirmly upon it, as if it were certain knowledge; and we reason and act\nthereupon with as little doubt as if it were perfect demonstration.\nThus, if all Englishmen, who have occasion to mention it, should affirm\nthat it froze in England the last winter, or that there were swallows\nseen there in the summer, I think a man could almost as little doubt of\nit as that seven and four are eleven. The first, therefore, and HIGHEST\nDEGREE OF PROBABILITY, is, when the general consent of all men, in all\nages, as far as it can be known, concurs with a man's constant and\nnever-failing experience in like cases, to confirm the truth of any\nparticular matter of fact attested by fair witnesses: such are all\nthe stated constitutions and properties of bodies, and the regular\nproceedings of causes and effects in the ordinary course of nature. This\nwe call an argument from the nature of things themselves. For what our\nown and other men's CONSTANT OBSERVATION has found always to be after\nthe same manner, that we with reason conclude to be the effect of\nsteady and regular causes; though they come not within the reach of our\nknowledge. Thus, That fire warmed a man, made lead fluid, and changed\nthe colour or consistency in wood or charcoal; that iron sunk in\nwater, and swam in quicksilver: these and the like propositions about\nparticular facts, being agreeable to our constant experience, as often\nas we have to do with these matters; and being generally spoke of (when\nmentioned by others) as things found constantly to be so, and therefore\nnot so much as controverted by anybody--we are put past doubt that a\nrelation affirming any such thing to have been, or any predication\nthat it will happen again in the same manner, is very true. These\nPROBABILITIES rise so near to CERTAINTY, that they govern our thoughts\nas absolutely, and influence all our actions as fully, as the most\nevident demonstration; and in what concerns us we make little or\nno difference between them and certain knowledge. Our belief, thus\ngrounded, rises to ASSURANCE.\n7. II. Unquestionable Testimony, and our own Experience that a thing is\nfor the most part so, produce Confidence.\nThe NEXT DEGREE OF PROBABILITY is, when I find by my own experience, and\nthe agreement of all others that mention it, a thing to be for the most\npart so, and that the particular instance of it is attested by many and\nundoubted witnesses: v.g. history giving us such an account of men in\nall ages, and my own experience, as far as I had an opportunity to\nobserve, confirming it, that most men prefer their private advantage to\nthe public: if all historians that write of Tiberius, say that Tiberius\ndid so, it is extremely probable. And in this case, our assent has a\nsufficient foundation to raise itself to a degree which we may call\nCONFIDENCE.\n8. III. Fair Testimony, and the Nature of the Thing indifferent, produce\nunavoidable Assent.\nIn things that happen indifferently, as that a bird should fly this or\nthat way; that it should thunder on a man's right or left hand, &c.,\nwhen any particular matter of fact is vouched by the concurrent\ntestimony of unsuspected witnesses, there our assent is also\nUNAVOIDABLE. Thus: that there is such a city in Italy as Rome: that\nabout one thousand seven hundred years ago, there lived in it a man,\ncalled Julius Caesar; that he was a general, and that he won a battle\nagainst another, called Pompey. This, though in the nature of the thing\nthere be nothing for nor against it, yet being related by historians of\ncredit, and contradicted by no one writer, a man cannot avoid believing\nit, and can as little doubt of it as he does of the being and actions of\nhis own acquaintance, whereof he himself is a witness.\n9. Experience and Testimonies clashing, infinitely vary the Degrees of\nProbability.\nThus far the matter goes easy enough. Probability upon such grounds\ncarries so much evidence with it, that it naturally determines the\njudgment, and leaves us as little liberty to believe or disbelieve, as a\ndemonstration does, whether we will know, or be ignorant. The difficulty\nis, when testimonies contradict common experience, and the reports of\nhistory and witnesses clash with the ordinary course of nature, or with\none another; there it is, where diligence, attention, and exactness are\nrequired, to form a right judgment, and to proportion the assent to the\ndifferent evidence and probability of the thing: which rises and\nfalls, according as those two foundations of credibility, viz. COMMON\nOBSERVATION IN LIKE CASES, and PARTICULAR TESTIMONIES IN THAT PARTICULAR\nINSTANCE, favour or contradict it. These are liable to so great\nvariety of contrary observations, circumstances, reports, different\nqualifications, tempers, designs, oversights, &c., of the reporters,\nthat it is impossible to reduce to precise rules the various degrees\nwherein men give their assent. This only may be said in general, That\nas the arguments and proofs PRO and CON, upon due examination, nicely\nweighing every particular circumstance, shall to any one appear, upon\nthe whole matter, in a greater or less degree to preponderate on\neither side; so they are fitted to produce in the mind such different\nentertainments, as we call BELIEF, CONJECTURE, GUESS, DOUBT, WAVERING,\nDISTRUST, DISBELIEF, &c.\n10. Traditional Testimonies, the further removed the less their Proof\nbecomes.\nThis is what concerns assent in matters wherein testimony is made use\nof: concerning which, I think, it may not be amiss to take notice of a\nrule observed in the law of England; which is, That though the attested\ncopy of a record be good proof, yet the copy of a copy, ever so well\nattested, and by ever so credible witnesses, will not be admitted as a\nproof in judicature. This is so generally approved as reasonable,\nand suited to the wisdom and caution to be used in our inquiry after\nmaterial truths, that I never yet heard of any one that blamed it.\nThis practice, if it be allowable in the decisions of right and wrong,\ncarries this observation along with it, viz. THAT ANY TESTIMONY, THE\nFURTHER OFF IT IS FROM THE ORIGINAL TRUTH, THE LESS FORCE AND PROOF IT\nHAS. The being and existence of the thing itself, is what I call the\noriginal truth. A credible man vouching his knowledge of it is a good\nproof; but if another equally credible do witness it from his report,\nthe testimony is weaker: and a third that attests the hearsay of an\nhearsay is yet less considerable. So that in traditional truths, each\nremove weakens the force of the proof: and the more hands the tradition\nhas successively passed through, the less strength and evidence does\nit receive from them. This I thought necessary to be taken notice of:\nbecause I find amongst some men the quite contrary commonly practised,\nwho look on opinions to gain force by growing older; and what a thousand\nyears since would not, to a rational man contemporary with the first\nvoucher, have appeared at all probable, is now urged as certain beyond\nall question, only because several have since, from him, said it one\nafter another. Upon this ground propositions, evidently false or\ndoubtful enough in their first beginning, come, by an inverted rule of\nprobability, to pass for authentic truths; and those which found or\ndeserved little credit from the mouths of their first authors, are\nthought to grow venerable by age, are urged as undeniable.\n11. Yet History is of great Use.\nI would not be thought here to lessen the credit and use of HISTORY: it\nis all the light we have in many cases, and we receive from it a great\npart of the useful truths we have, with a convincing evidence. I think\nnothing more valuable than the records of antiquity: I wish we had more\nof them, and more uncorrupted. But this truth itself forces me to say,\nThat no probability can rise higher than its first original. What has no\nother evidence than the single testimony of one only witness must stand\nor fall by his only testimony, whether good, bad, or indifferent; and\nthough cited afterwards by hundreds of others, one after another, is so\nfar from receiving any strength thereby, that it is only the weaker.\nPassion, interest, inadvertency, mistake of his meaning, and a thousand\nodd reasons, or capricios, men's minds are acted by, (impossible to\nbe discovered,) may make one man quote another man's words or meaning\nwrong. He that has but ever so little examined the citations of writers,\ncannot doubt how little credit the quotations deserve, where the\noriginals are wanting; and consequently how much less quotations of\nquotations can be relied on. This is certain, that what in one age was\naffirmed upon slight grounds, can never after come to be more valid in\nfuture ages by being often repeated. But the further still it is from\nthe original, the less valid it is, and has always less force in the\nmouth or writing of him that last made use of it than in his from whom\nhe received it.\n12. Secondly, In things which Sense cannot discover, Analogy is the\ngreat Rule of Probability.\n[SECONDLY], The probabilities we have hitherto mentioned are only such\nas concern matter of fact, and such things as are capable of observation\nand testimony. There remains that other sort, concerning which men\nentertain opinions with variety of assent, though THE THINGS BE SUCH,\nTHAT FALLING NOT UNDER THE REACH OF OUR SENSES, THEY ARE NOT CAPABLE OF\nTESTIMONY. Such are, 1. The existence, nature and operations of finite\nimmaterial beings without us; as spirits, angels, devils, &c. Or the\nexistence of material beings which, either for their smallness in\nthemselves or remoteness from us, our senses cannot take notice of--as,\nwhether there be any plants, animals, and intelligent inhabitants in\nthe planets, and other mansions of the vast universe. 2. Concerning\nthe manner of operation in most parts of the works of nature: wherein,\nthough we see the sensible effects, yet their causes are unknown, and we\nperceive not the ways and manner how they are produced. We see animals\nare generated, nourished, and move; the loadstone draws iron; and the\nparts of a candle, successively melting, turn into flame, and give us\nboth light and heat. These and the like effects we see and know: but the\ncauses that operate, and the manner they are produced in, we can only\nguess and probably conjecture. For these and the like, coming not within\nthe scrutiny of human senses, cannot be examined by them, or be attested\nby anybody; and therefore can appear more or less probable, only as they\nmore or less agree to truths that are established in our minds, and as\nthey hold proportion to other parts of our knowledge and observation.\nANALOGY in these matters is the only help we have, and it is from that\nalone we draw all our grounds of probability. Thus, observing that the\nbare rubbing of two bodies violently one upon another, produces heat,\nand very often fire itself, we have reason to think, that what we call\nHEAT and FIRE consists in a violent agitation of the imperceptible\nminute parts of the burning matter. Observing likewise that the\ndifferent refractions of pellucid bodies produce in our eyes the\ndifferent appearances of several colours; and also, that the different\nranging and laying the superficial parts of several bodies, as of\nvelvet, watered silk, &c., does the like, we think it probable that\nthe COLOUR and shining of bodies is in them nothing but the different\narrangement and refraction of their minute and insensible parts. Thus,\nfinding in all parts of the creation, that fall under human observation,\nthat there is A GRADUAL CONNEXION OF ONE WITH ANOTHER, WITHOUT ANY GREAT\nOR DISCERNIBLE GAPS BETWEEN, IN ALL THAT GREAT VARIETY OF THINGS WE SEE\nIN THE WORLD, which are so closely linked together, that, in the several\nranks of beings, it is not easy to discover the bounds betwixt them; we\nhave reason to be persuaded that, BY SUCH GENTLE STEPS, things ascend\nupwards in degrees of perfection. It is a hard matter to say where\nsensible and rational begin, and where insensible and irrational end:\nand who is there quick-sighted enough to determine precisely which is\nthe lowest species of living things, and which the first of those which\nhave no life? Things, as far as we can observe, lessen and augment, as\nthe quantity does in a regular cone; where, though there be a manifest\nodds betwixt the bigness of the diameter at a remote distance, yet the\ndifference between the upper and under, where they touch one another, is\nhardly discernible. The difference is exceeding great between some men\nand some animals: but if we will compare the understanding and abilities\nof some men and some brutes, we shall find so little difference, that it\nwill be hard to say, that that of the man is either clearer or larger.\nObserving, I say, such gradual and gentle descents downwards in those\nparts of the creation that are beneath man, the rule of analogy may make\nit probable, that it is so also in things above us and our observation;\nand that there are several ranks of intelligent beings, excelling us in\nseveral degrees of perfection, ascending upwards towards the infinite\nperfection of the Creator, by gentle steps and differences, that are\nevery one at no great distance from the next to it. This sort of\nprobability, which is the best conduct of rational experiments, and the\nrise of hypothesis, has also its use and influence; and a wary reasoning\nfrom analogy leads us often into the discovery of truths and useful\nproductions, which would otherwise lie concealed.\n13. One Case where contrary Experience lessens not the Testimony.\nThough the common experience and the ordinary course of things have\njustly a mighty influence on the minds of men, to make them give or\nrefuse credit to anything proposed to their belief; yet there is one\ncase, wherein the strangeness of the fact lessens not the assent to\na fair testimony given of it. For where such supernatural events are\nsuitable to ends aimed at by Him who has the power to change the course\nof nature, there, UNDER SUCH CIRCUMSTANCES, that may be the fitter to\nprocure belief, by how much the more they are beyond or contrary to\nordinary observation. This is the proper case of MIRACLES, which, well\nattested, do not only find credit themselves, but give it also to other\ntruths, which need such confirmation.\n14. The bare Testimony of Divine Revelation is the highest Certainty.\nBesides those we have hitherto mentioned, there is one sort of\npropositions that challenge the highest degree of our assent, upon bare\ntestimony, whether the thing proposed agree or disagree with common\nexperience, and the ordinary course of things, or no. The reason whereof\nis, because the testimony is of such an one as cannot deceive nor be\ndeceived: and that is of God himself. This carries with it an assurance\nbeyond doubt, evidence beyond exception. This is called by a peculiar\nname, REVELATION, and our assent to it, FAITH, which [as absolutely\ndetermines our minds, and as perfectly excludes all wavering,] as our\nknowledge itself; and we may as well doubt of our own being, as we can\nwhether any revelation from God be true. So that faith is a settled and\nsure principle of assent and assurance, and leaves no manner of room\nfor doubt or hesitation. ONLY WE MUST BE SURE THAT IT BE A DIVINE\nREVELATION, AND THAT WE UNDERSTAND IT RIGHT: else we shall expose\nourselves to all the extravagancy of enthusiasm, and all the error of\nwrong principles, if we have faith and assurance in what is not DIVINE\nrevelation. And therefore, in those cases, our assent can be rationally\nno higher than the evidence of its being a revelation, and that this is\nthe meaning of the expressions it is delivered in. If the evidence of\nits being a revelation, or that this is its true sense, be only on\nprobable proofs, our assent can reach no higher than an assurance or\ndiffidence, arising from the more or less apparent probability of the\nproofs. But of FAITH, and the precedency it ought to have before other\narguments of persuasion, I shall speak more hereafter; where I treat of\nit as it is ordinarily placed, in contradistinction to reason; though in\ntruth it be nothing else but AN ASSENT FOUNDED ON THE HIGHEST REASON.\nCHAPTER XVII. OF REASON\n1. Various Significations of the word Reason.\nTHE word REASON in the English language has different significations:\nsometimes it is taken for true and clear principles: sometimes for clear\nand fair deductions from those principles: and sometimes for the cause,\nand particularly the final cause. But the consideration I shall have of\nit here is in a signification different from all these; and that is, as\nit stands for a faculty in man, that faculty whereby man is supposed\nto be distinguished from beasts, and wherein it is evident he much\nsurpasses them.\n2. Wherein Reasoning consists.\nIf general knowledge, as has been shown, consists in a perception of the\nagreement or disagreement of our own ideas, and the knowledge of\nthe existence of all things without us (except only of a God, whose\nexistence every man may certainly know and demonstrate to himself from\nhis own existence), be had only by our senses, what room is there\nfor the exercise of any other faculty, but OUTWARD SENSE and INWARD\nPERCEPTION? What need is there of REASON? Very much: both for the\nenlargement of our knowledge, and regulating our assent. For it hath to\ndo both in knowledge and opinion, and is necessary and assisting to all\nour other intellectual faculties, and indeed contains two of them, viz.\nSAGACITY and ILLATION. By the one, it finds out; and by the other, it so\norders the intermediate ideas as to discover what connexion there is\nin each link of the chain, whereby the extremes are held together; and\nthereby, as it were, to draw into view the truth sought for, which is\nthat which we call ILLATION or INFERENCE, and consists in nothing but\nthe perception of the connexion there is between the ideas, in each step\nof the deduction; whereby the mind comes to see, either the certain\nagreement or disagreement of any two ideas, as in demonstration, in\nwhich it arrives at KNOWLEDGE; or their probable connexion, on which it\ngives or withholds its assent, as in OPINION. Sense and intuition reach\nbut a very little way. The greatest part of our knowledge depends upon\ndeductions and intermediate ideas: and in those cases where we are fain\nto substitute assent instead of knowledge, and take propositions for\ntrue, without being certain they are so, we have need to find out,\nexamine, and compare the grounds of their probability. In both these\ncases, the faculty which finds out the means, and rightly applies them,\nto discover certainty in the one, and probability in the other, is\nthat which we call REASON. For, as reason perceives the necessary and\nindubitable connexion of all the ideas or proofs one to another, in\neach step of any demonstration that produces knowledge; so it likewise\nperceives the probable connexion of all the ideas or proofs one to\nanother, in every step of a discourse, to which it will think assent\ndue. This is the lowest degree of that which can be truly called reason.\nFor where the mind does not perceive this probable connexion, where it\ndoes not discern whether there be any such connexion or no; there men's\nopinions are not the product of judgment, or the consequence of reason,\nbut the effects of chance and hazard, of a mind floating at all\nadventures, without choice and without direction.\n3. Reason in its four degrees.\nSo that we may in REASON consider these FOUR DEGREES: the first and\nhighest is the discovering and finding out of truths; the second, the\nregular and methodical disposition of them, and laying them in a clear\nand fit order, to make their connexion and force be plainly and easily\nperceived; the third is the perceiving their connexion; and the fourth,\na making a right conclusion. These several degrees may be observed in\nany mathematical demonstration; it being one thing to perceive the\nconnexion of each part, as the demonstration is made by another; another\nto perceive the dependence of the conclusion on all the parts; a third,\nto make out a demonstration clearly and neatly one's self; and something\ndifferent from all these, to have first found out these intermediate\nideas or proofs by which it is made.\n4. Whether Syllogism is the great Instrument of Reason.\nThere is one thing more which I shall desire to be considered concerning\nreason; and that is, whether SYLLOGISM, as is generally thought, be\nthe proper instrument of it, and the usefullest way of exercising this\nfaculty. The causes I have to doubt are these:--\nFirst Cause to doubt this.\nFIRST, Because syllogism serves our reason but in one only of the\nforementioned parts of it; and that is, to show the CONNEXION OF THE\nPROOFS in any one instance, and no more; but in this it is of no great\nuse, since the mind can perceive such connexion, where it really is, as\neasily, nay, perhaps better, without it.\nMen can reason well who cannot make a Syllogism.\nIf we will observe the actings of our own minds, we shall find that we\nreason best and clearest, when we only observe the connexion of the\nproof, without reducing our thoughts to any rule of syllogism. And\ntherefore we may take notice, that there are many men that reason\nexceeding clear and rightly, who know not how to make a syllogism. He\nthat will look into many parts of Asia and America, will find men reason\nthere perhaps as acutely as himself, who yet never heard of a syllogism,\nnor can reduce any one argument to those forms: [and I believe scarce\nany one makes syllogisms in reasoning within himself.] Indeed syllogism\nis made use of, on occasion, to discover a fallacy hid in a rhetorical\nflourish, or cunningly wrapt up in a smooth period; and, stripping an\nabsurdity of the cover of wit and good language, show it in its naked\ndeformity. But the mind is not taught to reason by these rules; it has a\nnative faculty to perceive the coherence or incoherence of its ideas,\nand can range them right without any such perplexing repetitions. Tell\na country gentlewoman that the wind is south-west, and the weather\nlowering, and like to rain, and she will easily understand it is not\nsafe for her to go abroad thin clad in such a day, after a fever: she\nclearly sees the probable connexion of all these, viz. south-west wind,\nand clouds, rain, wetting, taking cold, relapse, and danger of death,\nwithout tying them together in those artificial and cumbersome fetters\nof several syllogisms, that clog and hinder the mind, which proceeds\nfrom one part to another quicker and clearer without them: and the\nprobability which she easily perceives in things thus in their native\nstate would be quite lost, if this argument were managed learnedly, and\nproposed in MODE and FIGURE. For it very often confounds the connexion;\nand, I think, every one will perceive in mathematical demonstrations,\nthat the knowledge gained thereby comes shortest and clearest without\nsyllogism.\nSecondly, Because though syllogism serves to show the force or fallacy\nof an argument, made use of in the usual way of discoursing, BY\nSUPPLYING THE ABSENT PROPOSITION, and so, setting it before the view\nin a clear light; yet it no less engages the mind in the perplexity of\nobscure, equivocal, and fallacious terms, wherewith this artificial way\nof reasoning always abounds: it being adapted more to the attaining of\nvictory in dispute than the discovery and confirmation of truth in fair\nenquiries.\n5. Syllogism helps little in Demonstration, less in Probability.\nBut however it be in knowledge, I think I may truly say, it is OF FAR\nLESS, OR NO USE AT ALL IN PROBABILITIES. For the assent there being\nto be determined by the preponderancy, after due weighing of all the\nproofs, with all circumstances on both sides, nothing is so unfit to\nassist the mind in that as syllogism; which running away with one\nassumed probability, or one topical argument, pursues that till it has\nled the mind quite out of sight of the thing under consideration; and,\nforcing it upon some remote difficulty, holds it fast there; entangled\nperhaps, and, as it were, manacled, in the chain of syllogisms, without\nallowing it the liberty, much less affording it the helps, requisite to\nshow on which side, all things considered, is the greater probability.\n6. Serves not to increase our Knowledge, but to fence with the Knowledge\nwe suppose we have.\nBut let it help us (as perhaps may be said) in convincing men of their\nerrors and mistakes: (and yet I would fain see the man that was forced\nout of his opinion by dint of syllogism,) yet still it fails our reason\nin that part, which, if not its highest perfection, is yet certainly its\nhardest task, and that which we most need its help in; and that is\nTHE FINDING OUT OF PROOFS, AND MAKING NEW DISCOVERIES. The rules of\nsyllogism serve not to furnish the mind with those intermediate ideas\nthat may show the connexion of remote ones. This way of reasoning\ndiscovers no new proofs, but is the art of marshalling and ranging the\nold ones we have already. The forty-seventh proposition of the first\nbook of Euclid is very true; but the discovery of it, I think, not owing\nto any rules of common logic. A man knows first and then he is able to\nprove syllogistically. So that syllogism comes after knowledge, and then\na man has little or no need of it. But it is chiefly by the finding out\nthose ideas that show the connexion of distant ones, that our stock of\nknowledge is increased, and that useful arts and sciences are advanced.\nSyllogism, at best, is but the art of fencing with the little knowledge\nwe have, without making any addition to it. And if a man should employ\nhis reason all this way, he will not do much otherwise than he who,\nhaving got some iron out of the bowels of the earth, should have it\nbeaten up all into swords, and put it into his servants' hands to fence\nwith and bang one another. Had the King of Spain employed the hands of\nhis people, and his Spanish iron so, he had brought to light but little\nof that treasure that lay so long hid in the dark entrails of America.\nAnd I am apt to think that he who shall employ all the force of his\nreason only in brandishing of syllogisms, will discover very little of\nthat mass of knowledge which lies yet concealed in the secret recesses\nof nature; and which, I am apt to think, native rustic reason (as it\nformerly has done) is likelier to open a way to, and add to the common\nstock of mankind, rather than any scholastic proceeding by the strict\nrules of MODE and FIGURE.\n7. Other Helps to reason than Syllogism should be sought.\nI doubt not, nevertheless, but there are ways to be found to assist\nour reason in this most useful part; and this the judicious Hooker\nencourages me to say, who in his Eccl. Pol. 1. i. Section 6, speaks\nthus: 'If there might be added the right helps of true art and learning,\n(which helps, I must plainly confess, this age of the world, carrying\nthe name of a learned age, doth neither much know nor generally regard,)\nthere would undoubtedly be almost as much difference in maturity of\njudgment between men therewith inured, and that which men now are, as\nbetween men that are now, and innocents.' I do not pretend to have found\nor discovered here any of those 'right helps of art,' this great man of\ndeep thought mentions: but that is plain, that syllogism, and the logic\nnow in use, which were as well known in his days, can be none of those\nhe means. It is sufficient for me, if by a Discourse, perhaps something\nout of the way, I am sure, as to me, wholly new and unborrowed, I shall\nhave given occasion to others to cast about for new discoveries, and\nto seek in their own thoughts for those right helps of art, which will\nscarce be found, I fear, by those who servilely confine themselves to\nthe rules and dictates of others. For beaten tracks lead this sort of\ncattle, (as an observing Roman calls them,) whose thoughts reach only to\nimitation, NON QUO EUNDUM EST, SED QUO ITUR. But I can be bold to say,\nthat this age is adorned with some men of that strength of judgment and\nlargeness of comprehension, that, if they would employ their thoughts on\nthis subject, could open new and undiscovered ways to the advancement of\nknowledge.\n8. We can reason about Particulars; and the immediate object of all our\nreasonings is nothing but particular ideas.\nHaving here had occasion to speak of syllogism in general, and the use\nof it in reasoning, and the improvement of our knowledge, it is fit,\nbefore I leave this subject, to take notice of one manifest mistake in\nthe rules of syllogism: viz. that no syllogistical reasoning can be\nright and conclusive, but what has at least one GENERAL proposition in\nit. As if we could not reason, and have knowledge about particulars:\nwhereas, in truth, the matter rightly considered, the immediate object\nof all our reasoning and knowledge, is nothing but particulars. Every\nman's reasoning and knowledge is only about the ideas existing in his\nown mind; which are truly, every one of them, particular existences: and\nour knowledge and reason about other things, is only as they correspond\nwith those our particular ideas. So that the perception of the agreement\nor disagreement of our particular ideas, is the whole and utmost of all\nour knowledge. Universality is but accidental to it, and consists only\nin this, that the particular ideas about which it is are such as more\nthan one particular, thing can correspond with and be represented by.\nBut the perception of the agreement or disagreement of our particular\nideas, and consequently our knowledge, is equally clear and certain,\nwhether either, or both, or neither of those ideas, be capable of\nrepresenting more real beings than one, or no.\n9. Our Reason often fails us.\nREASON, though it penetrates into the depths of the sea and earth,\nelevates our thoughts as high as the stars, and leads us through the\nvast spaces and large rooms of this mighty fabric, yet it comes far\nshort of the real extent of even corporeal being. And there are many\ninstances wherein it fails us: as,\nFirst, In cases when we have no Ideas.\nI. It perfectly fails us, where our ideas fail. It neither does nor can\nextend itself further than they do. And therefore, wherever we have no\nideas, our reasoning stops, and we are at an end of our reckoning: and\nif at any time we reason about words which do not stand for any ideas,\nit is only about those sounds, and nothing else.\n10. Secondly, Because our Ideas are often obscure or imperfect.\nII. Our reason is often puzzled and at a loss, because of the obscurity,\nconfusion, or imperfection of the ideas it is employed about; and there\nwe are involved in difficulties and contradictions. Thus, not having any\nperfect idea of the LEAST EXTENSION OF MATTER, nor of INFINITY, we are\nat a loss about the divisibility of matter; but having perfect, clear,\nand distinct ideas of NUMBER, our reason meets with none of those\ninextricable difficulties in numbers, nor finds itself involved in any\ncontradictions about them. Thus, we having but imperfect ideas of the\noperations of our minds, and of the beginning of motion, or thought how\nthe mind produces either of them in us, and much imperfecter yet of the\noperation of God, run into great difficulties about FREE CREATED AGENTS,\nwhich reason cannot well extricate itself out of.\n11. III. Thirdly, Because we perceive not intermediate Ideas to show\nconclusions.\nOur reason is often at a stand, because it perceives not those ideas,\nwhich could serve to show the certain or probable agreement or\ndisagreement of any other two ideas: and in this some men's faculties\nfar outgo others. Till algebra, that great instrument and instance of\nhuman sagacity, was discovered, men with amazement looked on several of\nthe demonstrations of ancient mathematicians, and could scarce forbear\nto think the finding several of those proofs to be something more than\nhuman.\n12. IV. Fourthly, Because we often proceed upon wrong Principles.\nThe mind, by proceeding upon false principles, is often engaged in\nabsurdities and difficulties, brought into straits and contradictions,\nwithout knowing how to free itself: and in that case it is in vain to\nimplore the help of reason, unless it be to discover the falsehood and\nreject the influence of those wrong principles. Reason is so far from\nclearing the difficulties which the building upon false foundations\nbrings a man into, that if he will pursue it, it entangles him the more,\nand engages him deeper in perplexities.\n13. V. Fifthly, Because we often employ doubtful Terms.\nAs obscure and imperfect ideas often involve our reason, so, upon the\nsame ground, do dubious words and uncertain signs, often, in discourses\nand arguings, when not warily attended to, puzzle men's reason, and\nbring them to a nonplus. But these two latter are our fault, and not\nthe fault of reason. But yet the consequences of them are nevertheless\nobvious; and the perplexities or errors they fill men's minds with are\neverywhere observable.\n14. Our highest Degree of Knowledge is intuitive, without Reasoning.\nSome of the ideas that are in the mind, are so there, that they can be\nby themselves immediately compared one with another: and in these the\nmind is able to perceive that they agree or disagree as clearly as that\nit has them. Thus the mind perceives, that an arch of a circle is less\nthan the whole circle, as clearly as it does the idea of a circle: and\nthis, therefore, as has been said, I call INTUITIVE KNOWLEDGE; which is\ncertain, beyond all doubt, and needs no probation, nor can have any;\nthis being the highest of all human certainty. In this consists the\nevidence of all those MAXIMS which nobody has any doubt about, but every\nman (does not, as is said, only assent to, but) KNOWS to be true, as\nsoon as ever they are proposed to his understanding. In the discovery of\nand assent to these truths, there is no use of the discursive faculty,\nNO NEED OF REASONING, but they are known by a superior and higher degree\nof evidence. And such, if I may guess at things unknown, I am apt to\nthink that angels have now, and the spirits of just men made perfect\nshall have, in a future state, of thousands of things which now either\nwholly escape our apprehensions, or which our short-sighted reason\nhaving got some faint glimpse of, we, in the dark, grope after.\n15. The next is got by Reasoning.\nBut though we have, here and there, a little of this clear light, some\nsparks of bright knowledge, yet the greatest part of our ideas are such,\nthat we cannot discern their agreement or disagreement by an immediate\ncomparing them. And in all these we have NEED OF REASONING, and must, by\ndiscourse and inference, make our discoveries. Now of these there are\ntwo sorts, which I shall take the liberty to mention here again:--\nFirst, through Reasonings that are Demonstrative.\nFirst, Those whose agreement or disagreement, though it cannot be seen\nby an immediate putting them together, yet may be examined by the\nintervention of other ideas which can be compared with them. In this\ncase, when the agreement or disagreement of the intermediate idea, on\nboth sides, with those which we would compare, is PLAINLY DISCERNED:\nthere it amounts to DEMONSTRATION whereby knowledge is produced, which,\nthough it be certain, yet it is not so easy, nor altogether so clear\nas intuitive knowledge. Because in that there is barely one simple\nintuition, wherein there is no room for any the least mistake or doubt:\nthe truth is seen all perfectly at once. In demonstration, it is true,\nthere is intuition too, but not altogether at once; for there must be\na remembrance of the intuition of the agreement of the medium, or\nintermediate idea, with that we compared it with before, when we compare\nit with the other: and where there be many mediums, there the danger of\nthe mistake is the greater. For each agreement or disagreement of the\nideas must be observed and seen in each step of the whole train, and\nretained in the memory, just as it is; and the mind must be sure that\nno part of what is necessary to make up the demonstration is omitted or\noverlooked. This makes some demonstrations long and perplexed, and too\nhard for those who have not strength of parts distinctly to perceive,\nand exactly carry so many particulars orderly in their heads. And even\nthose who are able to master such intricate speculations, are fain\nsometimes to go over them again, and there is need of more than one\nreview before they can arrive at certainty. But yet where the mind\nclearly retains the intuition it had of the agreement of any idea with\nanother, and that with a third, and that with a fourth, &c., there the\nagreement of the first and the fourth is a demonstration, and produces\ncertain knowledge; which may be called RATIONAL KNOWLEDGE, as the other\nis intuitive.\n16. Secondly, to supply the narrowness of Demonstrative and Intuitive\nKnowledge we have nothing but Judgment upon probable reasoning.\nSecondly, There are other ideas, whose agreement or disagreement can no\notherwise be judged of but by the intervention of others which have not\na certain agreement with the extremes, but an USUAL or LIKELY one:\nand in these is that the JUDGMENT is properly exercised; which is the\nacquiescing of the mind, that any ideas do agree, by comparing them with\nsuch probable mediums. This, though it never amounts to knowledge,\nno, not to that which is the lowest degree of it; yet sometimes the\nintermediate ideas tie the extremes so firmly together, and the\nprobability is so clear and strong, that ASSENT as necessarily follows\nit, as KNOWLEDGE does demonstration. The great excellency and use of the\njudgment is to observe right, and take a true estimate of the force and\nweight of each probability; and then casting them up all right together,\nchoose that side which has the overbalance.\n17. Intuition, Demonstration, Judgment.\nINTUITIVE KNOWLEDGE is the perception of the CERTAIN agreement or\ndisagreement of two ideas immediately compared together.\nRATIONAL KNOWLEDGE is the perception of the CERTAIN agreement or\ndisagreement of any two ideas, by the intervention of one or more other\nideas.\nJUDGMENT is the thinking or taking two ideas to agree or disagree,\nby the intervention of one or more ideas, whose certain agreement or\ndisagreement with them it does not perceive, but hath observed to be\nFREQUENT and USUAL.\n18. Consequences of Words, and Consequences of Ideas.\nThough the deducing one proposition from another, or making inferences\nin WORDS, be a great part of reason, and that which it is usually\nemployed about; yet the principal act of ratiocination is THE FINDING\nTHE AGREEMENT OR DISAGREEMENT OF TWO IDEAS ONE WITH ANOTHER, BY THE\nINTERVENTION OF A THIRD. As a man, by a yard, finds two houses to be of\nthe same length, which could not be brought together to measure their\nequality by juxta-position. Words have their consequences, as the signs\nof such ideas: and things agree or disagree, as really they are; but we\nobserve it only by our ideas.\n19. Four sorts of Arguments.\nBefore we quit this subject, it may be worth our while a little to\nreflect on FOUR SORTS OF ARGUMENTS, that men, in their reasonings with\nothers, do ordinarily make use of to prevail on their assent; or at\nleast so to awe them as to silence their opposition.\nFirst, Argumentum ad verecundiam.\nI. The first is, to allege the opinions of men, whose parts, learning,\neminency, power, or some other cause has gained a name, and settled\ntheir reputation in the common esteem with some kind of authority. When\nmen are established in any kind of dignity, it is thought a breach\nof modesty for others to derogate any way from it, and question the\nauthority of men who are in possession of it. This is apt to be\ncensured, as carrying with it too much pride, when a man does not\nreadily yield to the determination of approved authors, which is wont to\nbe received with respect and submission by others: and it is looked upon\nas insolence, for a man to set up and adhere to his own opinion against\nthe current stream of antiquity; or to put it in the balance against\nthat of some learned doctor, or otherwise approved writer. Whoever backs\nhis tenets with such authorities, thinks he ought thereby to carry the\ncause, and is ready to style it impudence in any one who shall stand out\nagainst them. This I think may be called ARGUMENTUM AD VERECUNDIAM.\n20. Secondly, Argumentum ad Ignorantiam.\nII. Secondly, Another way that men ordinarily use to drive others, and\nforce them to submit their judgments, and receive the opinion in debate,\nis to require the adversary to admit what they allege as a proof, or to\nassign a better. And this I call ARGUMENTUM AD IGNORANTIAM.\n21. Thirdly, Argumentum ad hominem.\nIII. Thirdly, A third way is to press a man with consequences drawn from\nhis own principles or concessions. This is already known under the name\nof ARGUMENTUM AD HOMINEM.\n22. Fourthly, Argumentum ad justicium. The Fourth alone advances us in\nknowledge and judgment.\nIV. The fourth is the using of proofs drawn from any of the foundations\nof knowledge or probability. This I call ARGUMENTUM AD JUSTICIUM. This\nalone, of all the four, brings true instruction with it, and advances us\nin our way to knowledge. For, 1. It argues not another man's opinion to\nbe right, because I, out of respect, or any other consideration but that\nof conviction, will not contradict him. 2. It proves not another man to\nbe in the right way, nor that I ought to take the same with him, because\nI know not a better. 3. Nor does it follow that another man is in the\nright way, because he has shown me that I am in the wrong. I may be\nmodest, and therefore not oppose another man's persuasion: I may be\nignorant, and not be able to produce a better: I may be in an error, and\nanother may show me that I am so. This may dispose me, perhaps, for the\nreception of truth, but helps me not to it: that must come from proofs\nand arguments, and light arising from the nature of things themselves,\nand not from my shamefacedness, ignorance, or error.\n23. Above, contrary, and according to Reason.\nBy what has been before said of reason, we may be able to make some\nguess at the distinction of things, into those that are according\nto, above, and contrary to reason. 1. ACCORDING TO REASON are such\npropositions whose truth we can discover by examining and tracing those\nideas we have from sensation and reflection; and by natural deduction\nfind to be true or probable. 2. ABOVE REASON are such propositions whose\ntruth or probability we cannot by reason derive from those principles.\n3. CONTRARY TO REASON are such propositions as are inconsistent with or\nirreconcilable to our clear and distinct ideas. Thus the existence of\none God is according to reason; the existence of more than one God,\ncontrary to reason; the resurrection of the dead, above reason. ABOVE\nREASON also may be taken in a double sense, viz. either as signifying\nabove probability, or above certainty: and in that large sense also,\nCONTRARY TO REASON, is, I suppose, sometimes taken.\n24. Reason and Faith not opposite, for Faith must be regulated by\nReason.\nThere is another use of the word REASON, wherein it is OPPOSED TO FAITH:\nwhich, though it be in itself a very improper way of speaking, yet\ncommon use has so authorized it, that it would be folly either to oppose\nor hope to remedy it. Only I think it may not be amiss to take notice,\nthat, however faith be opposed to reason, faith is nothing but a firm\nassent of the mind: which, if it be regulated, as is our duty, cannot be\nafforded to anything but upon good reason; and so cannot be opposite to\nit. He that believes without having any reason for believing, may be in\nlove with his own fancies; but neither seeks truth as he ought, nor pays\nthe obedience due to his Maker, who would have him use those discerning\nfaculties he has given him, to keep him out of mistake and error. He\nthat does not this to the best of his power, however he sometimes lights\non truth, is in the right but by chance; and I know not whether\nthe luckiness of the accident will excuse the irregularity of his\nproceeding. This at least is certain, that he must be accountable for\nwhatever mistakes he runs into: whereas he that makes use of the light\nand faculties God has given him, and seeks sincerely to discover truth\nby those helps and abilities he has, may have this satisfaction in doing\nhis duty as a rational creature, that, though he should miss truth, he\nwill not miss the reward of it. For he governs his assent right, and\nplaces it as he should, who, in any case or matter whatsoever, believes\nor disbelieves according as reason directs him. He that doth otherwise,\ntransgresses against his own light, and misuses those faculties which\nwere given him to no other end, but to search and follow the clearer\nevidence and greater probability. But since reason and faith are by some\nmen opposed, we will so consider them in the following chapter.\nCHAPTER XVIII.\nOF FAITH AND REASON, AND THEIR DISTINCT PROVINCES.\n1. Necessary to know their boundaries.\nIt has been above shown, 1. That we are of necessity ignorant, and want\nknowledge of all sorts, where we want ideas. 2. That we are ignorant,\nand want rational knowledge, where we want proofs. 3. That we want\ncertain knowledge and certainty, as far as we want clear and determined\nspecific ideas. 4. That we want probability to direct our assent in\nmatters where we have neither knowledge of our own nor testimony of\nother men to bottom our reason upon. From these things thus premised, I\nthink we may come to lay down THE MEASURES AND BOUNDARIES BETWEEN FAITH\nAND REASON: the want whereof may possibly have been the cause, if not of\ngreat disorders, yet at least of great disputes, and perhaps mistakes\nin the world. For till it be resolved how far we are to be guided by\nreason, and how far by faith, we shall in vain dispute, and endeavour to\nconvince one another in matters of religion.\n2. Faith and Reason, what, as contradistingushed.\nI find every sect, as far as reason will help them, make use of it\ngladly: and where it fails them, they cry out, It is matter of faith,\nand above reason. And I do not see how they can argue with any one,\nor ever convince a gainsayer who makes use of the same plea, without\nsetting down strict boundaries between faith and reason; which ought to\nbe the first point established in all questions where faith has anything\nto do.\nREASON, therefore, here, as contradistinguished to FAITH, I take to be\nthe discovery of the certainty or probability of such propositions or\ntruths, which the mind arrives at by deduction made from such ideas,\nwhich it has got by the use of its natural faculties; viz. by sensation\nor reflection.\nFAITH, on the other side, is the assent to any proposition, not thus\nmade out by the deductions of reason, but upon the credit of\nthe proposer, as coming from God, in some extraordinary way of\ncommunication. This way of discovering truths to men, we call\nREVELATION.\n3. First, No new simple Idea can be conveyed by traditional Revelation.\nFIRST, Then I say, that NO MAN INSPIRED BY GOD CAN BY ANY REVELATION\nCOMMUNICATE TO OTHERS ANY NEW SIMPLE IDEAS WHICH THEY HAD NOT BEFORE\nFROM SENSATION OR REFLECTION. For, whatsoever impressions he himself may\nhave from the immediate hand of God, this revelation, if it be of new\nsimple ideas, cannot be conveyed to another, either by words or any\nother signs. Because words, by their immediate operation on us, cause no\nother ideas but of their natural sounds: and it is by the custom of\nusing them for signs, that they excite and revive in our minds latent\nideas; but yet only such ideas as were there before. For words, seen or\nheard, recal to our thoughts those ideas only which to us they have been\nwont to be signs of, but cannot introduce any perfectly new, and\nformerly unknown simple ideas. The same holds in all other signs; which\ncannot signify to us things of which we have before never had any idea\nat all.\nThus whatever things were discovered to St. Paul, when he was rapt up\ninto the third heaven; whatever new ideas his mind there received, all\nthe description he can make to others of that place, is only this, That\nthere are such things, 'as eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, nor hath\nit entered into the heart of man to conceive.' And supposing God should\ndiscover to any one, supernaturally, a species of creatures inhabiting,\nfor example, Jupiter or Saturn, (for that it is possible there may be\nsuch, nobody can deny,) which had six senses; and imprint on his mind\nthe ideas conveyed to theirs by that sixth sense: he could no more, by\nwords, produce in the minds of other men those ideas imprinted by that\nsixth sense, than one of us could convey the idea of any colour, by the\nsound of words, into a man who, having the other four senses perfect,\nhad always totally wanted the fifth, of seeing. For our simple ideas,\nthen, which are the foundation, and sole matter of all our notions and\nknowledge, we must depend wholly on our reason, I mean our natural\nfaculties; and can by no means receive them, or any of them, from\ntraditional revelation. I say, TRADITIONAL REVELATION, in distinction to\nORIGINAL REVELATION. By the one, I mean that first impression which is\nmade immediately by God on the mind of any man, to which we cannot set\nany bounds; and by the other, those impressions delivered over to others\nin words, and the ordinary ways of conveying our conceptions one to\nanother.\n4. Secondly, Traditional Revelation may make us know Propositions\nknowable also by Reason, but not with the same Certainty that Reason\ndoth.\nSECONDLY, I say that THE SAME TRUTHS MAY BE DISCOVERED, AND CONVEYED\nDOWN FROM REVELATION, WHICH ARE DISCERNABLE TO US BY REASON, AND BY\nTHOSE IDEAS WE NATURALLY MAY HAVE. So God might, by revelation, discover\nthe truth of any proposition in Euclid; as well as men, by the natural\nuse of their faculties, come to make the discovery themselves. In all\nthings of this kind there is little need or use of revelation, God\nhaving furnished us with natural and surer means to arrive at the\nknowledge of them. For whatsoever truth we come to the clear discovery\nof, from the knowledge and contemplation of our own ideas, will always\nbe certainer to us than those which are conveyed to us by TRADITIONAL\nREVELATION. For the knowledge we have that this revelation came at first\nfrom God, can never be so sure as the knowledge we have from the clear\nand distinct perception of the agreement or disagreement of our own\nideas: v.g. if it were revealed some ages since, that the three angles\nof a triangle were equal to two right ones, I might assent to the truth\nof that proposition, upon the credit of the tradition, that it was\nrevealed: but that would never amount to so great a certainty as the\nknowledge of it, upon the comparing and measuring my own ideas of two\nright angles, and the three angles of a triangle. The like holds in\nmatter of fact knowable by our senses; v.g. the history of the deluge is\nconveyed to us by writings which had their original from revelation: and\nyet nobody, I think, will say he has as certain and clear a knowledge of\nthe flood as Noah, that saw it; or that he himself would have had, had\nhe then been alive and seen it. For he has no greater an assurance than\nthat of his senses, that it is writ in the book supposed writ by Moses\ninspired: but he has not so great an assurance that Moses wrote that\nbook as if he had seen Moses write it. So that the assurance of its\nbeing a revelation is less still than the assurance of his senses.\n5. Even Original Revelation cannot be admitted against the clear Evidence\nof Reason.\nIn propositions, then, whose certainty is built upon the clear\nperception of the agreement or disagreement of our ideas, attained\neither by immediate intuition, as in self-evident propositions, or\nby evident deductions of reason in demonstrations we need not the\nassistance of revelation, as necessary to gain our assent, and introduce\nthem into our minds. Because the natural ways of knowledge could settle\nthem there, or had done it already; which is the greatest assurance we\ncan possibly have of anything, unless where God immediately reveals it\nto us: and there too our assurance can be no greater than our knowledge\nis, that it IS a revelation from God. But yet nothing, I think, can,\nunder that title, shake or overrule plain knowledge; or rationally\nprevail with any man to admit it for true, in a direct contradiction to\nthe clear evidence of his own understanding. For, since no evidence of\nour faculties, by which we receive such revelations, can exceed, if\nequal, the certainty of our intuitive knowledge, we can never receive\nfor a truth anything that is directly contrary to our clear and distinct\nknowledge; v.g. the ideas of one body and one place do so clearly agree,\nand the mind has so evident a perception of their agreement, that we can\nnever assent to a proposition that affirms the same body to be in two\ndistant places at once, however it should pretend to the authority of\na divine revelation: since the evidence, first, that we deceive not\nourselves, in ascribing it to God; secondly, that we understand it\nright; can never be so great as the evidence of our own intuitive\nknowledge, whereby we discern it impossible for the same body to be in\ntwo places at once. And therefore NO PROPOSITION CAN BE RECEIVED FOR\nDIVINE REVELATION, OR OBTAIN THE ASSENT DUE TO ALL SUCH, IF IT BE\nCONTRADICTORY TO OUR CLEAR INTUITIVE KNOWLEDGE. Because this would be to\nsubvert the principles and foundations of all knowledge, evidence, and\nassent whatsoever: and there would be left no difference between truth\nand falsehood, no measures of credible and incredible in the world, if\ndoubtful propositions shall take place before self-evident; and what\nwe certainly know give way to what we may possibly be mistaken in. In\npropositions therefore contrary to the clear perception of the agreement\nor disagreement of any of our ideas, it will be in vain to urge them as\nmatters of faith. They cannot move our assent under that or any other\ntitle whatsoever. For faith can never convince us of anything that\ncontradicts our knowledge. Because, though faith be founded on the\ntestimony of God (who cannot lie) revealing any proposition to us:\nyet we cannot have an assurance of the truth of its being a divine\nrevelation greater than our own knowledge. Since the whole strength of\nthe certainty depends upon our knowledge that God revealed it; which,\nin this case, where the proposition supposed revealed contradicts our\nknowledge or reason, will always have this objection hanging to it, viz.\nthat we cannot tell how to conceive that to come from God, the bountiful\nAuthor of our being, which, if received for true, must overturn all the\nprinciples and foundations of knowledge he has given us; render all\nour faculties useless; wholly destroy the most excellent part of his\nworkmanship, our understandings; and put a man in a condition wherein he\nwill have less light, less conduct than the beast that perisheth. For\nif the mind of man can never have a clearer (and perhaps not so clear)\nevidence of anything to be a divine revelation, as it has of the\nprinciples of its own reason, it can never have a ground to quit the\nclear evidence of its reason, to give a place to a proposition, whose\nrevelation has not a greater evidence than those principles have.\n6. Traditional Revelation much less.\nThus far a man has use of reason, and ought to hearken to it, even in\nimmediate and original revelation, where it is supposed to be made to\nhimself. But to all those who pretend not to immediate revelation, but\nare required to pay obedience, and to receive the truths revealed to\nothers, which, by the tradition of writings, or word of mouth, are\nconveyed down to them, reason has a great deal more to do, and is that\nonly which can induce us to receive them. For matter of faith being only\ndivine revelation, and nothing else, faith, as we use the word, (called\ncommonly DIVINE FAITH), has to do with no propositions, but those which\nare supposed to be divinely revealed. So that I do not see how those who\nmake revelation alone the sole object of faith can say, That it is a\nmatter of faith, and not of reason, to believe that such or such\na proposition, to be found in such or such a book, is of divine\ninspiration; unless it be revealed that that proposition, or all in that\nbook, was communicated by divine inspiration. Without such a revelation,\nthe believing, or not believing, that proposition, or book, to be of\ndivine authority, can never be matter of faith, but matter of reason;\nand such as I must come to an assent to only by the use of my reason,\nwhich can never require or enable me to believe that which is contrary\nto itself: it being impossible for reason ever to procure any assent to\nthat which to itself appears unreasonable.\nIn all things, therefore, where we have clear evidence from our ideas,\nand those principles of knowledge I have above mentioned, reason is the\nproper judge; and revelation, though it may, in consenting with it,\nconfirm its dictates, yet cannot in such cases invalidate its decrees:\nnor can we be obliged, where we have the clear and evident sentence of\nreason, to quit it for the contrary opinion, under a pretence that it is\nmatter of faith: which can have no authority against the plain and clear\ndictates of reason.\n7. Thirdly, things above Reason are, when revealed, the proper matter of\nfaith.\nBut, THIRDLY, There being many things wherein we have very imperfect\nnotions, or none at all; and other things, of whose past, present, or\nfuture existence, by the natural use of our faculties, we can have no\nknowledge at all; these, as being beyond the discovery of our natural\nfaculties, and ABOVE REASON, are, when revealed, THE PROPER MATTER OF\nFAITH. Thus, that part of the angels rebelled against God, and thereby\nlost their first happy state: and that the dead shall rise, and live\nagain: these and the like, being beyond the discovery of reason, are\npurely matters of faith, with which reason has directly nothing to do.\n8. Or not contrary to Reason, if revealed, are Matter of Faith; and must\ncarry it against probable conjectures of Reason.\nBut since God, in giving us the light of reason, has not thereby tied\nup his own hands from affording us, when he thinks fit, the light of\nrevelation in any of those matters wherein our natural faculties are\nable to give a probable determination; REVELATION, where God has been\npleased to give it, MUST CARRY IT AGAINST THE PROBABLE CONJECTURES OF\nREASON. Because the mind not being certain of the truth of that it does\nnot evidently know, but only yielding to the probability that appears\nin it, is bound to give up its assent to such a testimony which, it is\nsatisfied, comes from one who cannot err, and will not deceive. But\nyet, it still belongs to reason to judge of the truth of its being\na revelation, and of the signification of the words wherein it is\ndelivered. Indeed, if anything shall be thought revelation which is\ncontrary to the plain principles of reason, and the evident knowledge\nthe mind has of its own clear and distinct ideas; there reason must be\nhearkened to, as to a matter within its province. Since a man can never\nhave so certain a knowledge, that a proposition which contradicts\nthe clear principles and evidence of his own knowledge was divinely\nrevealed, or that he understands the words rightly wherein it is\ndelivered, as he has that the contrary is true, and so is bound to\nconsider and judge of it as a matter of reason, and not swallow it,\nwithout examination, as a matter of faith.\n9. Revelation in Matters where Reason cannot judge, or but probably,\nought to be hearkened to.\nFirst, Whatever proposition is revealed, of whose truth our mind, by its\nnatural faculties and notions, cannot judge, that is purely matter of\nfaith, and above reason.\nSecondly, All propositions whereof the mind, by the use of its natural\nfaculties, can come to determine and judge, from naturally acquired\nideas, are matter of reason; with this difference still, that, in those\nconcerning which it has but an uncertain evidence, and so is persuaded\nof their truth only upon probable grounds, which still admit a\npossibility of the contrary to be true, without doing violence to the\ncertain evidence of its own knowledge, and overturning the principles of\nall reason; in such probable propositions, I say, an evident revelation\nought to determine our assent, even against probability. For where the\nprinciples of reason have not evidenced a proposition to be certainly\ntrue or false, there clear revelation, as another principle of truth and\nground of assent, may determine; and so it may be matter of faith, and\nbe also above reason. Because reason, in that particular matter, being\nable to reach no higher than probability, faith gave the determination\nwhere reason came short; and revelation discovered on which side the\ntruth lay.\n10. In Matters where Reason can afford certain Knowledge, that is to be\nhearkened to.\nThus far the dominion of faith reaches, and that without any violence or\nhindrance to reason; which is not injured or disturbed, but assisted and\nimproved by new discoveries of truth, coming from the eternal fountain\nof all knowledge. Whatever God hath revealed is certainly true: no doubt\ncan be made of it. This is the proper object of faith: but whether it be\na DIVINE revelation or no, reason must judge; which can never permit the\nmind to reject a greater evidence to embrace what is less evident,\nnor allow it to entertain probability in opposition to knowledge and\ncertainty. There can be no evidence that any traditional revelation is\nof divine original, in the words we receive it, and in the sense we\nunderstand it, so clear and so certain as that of the principles of\nreason: and therefore NOTHING THAT IS CONTRARY TO, AND INCONSISTENT\nWITH, THE CLEAR AND SELF-EVIDENT DICTATES OF REASON, HAS A RIGHT TO BE\nURGED OR ASSENTED TO AS A MATTER OF FAITH, WHEREIN REASON HATH NOTHING\nTO DO. Whatsoever is divine revelation, ought to overrule all our\nopinions, prejudices, and interest, and hath a right to be received with\nfull assent. Such a submission as this, of our reason to faith, takes\nnot away the landmarks of knowledge: this shakes not the foundations\nof reason, but leaves us that use of our faculties for which they were\ngiven us.\n11. If the Boundaries be not set between Faith and Reason, no Enthusiasm\nor Extravagancy in Religion can be contradicted.\nIf the provinces of faith and reason are not kept distinct by these\nboundaries, there will, in matters of religion, be no room for reason at\nall; and those extravagant opinions and ceremonies that are to be found\nin the several religions of the world will not deserve to be blamed.\nFor, to this crying up of faith in OPPOSITION to reason, we may, I\nthink, in good measure ascribe those absurdities that fill almost all\nthe religions which possess and divide mankind. For men having been\nprincipled with an opinion, that they must not consult reason in the\nthings of religion, however apparently contradictory to common sense and\nthe very principles of all their knowledge, have let loose their fancies\nand natural superstition; and have been by them led into so strange\nopinions, and extravagant practices in religion, that a considerate man\ncannot but stand amazed, at their follies, and judge them so far from\nbeing acceptable to the great and wise God, that he cannot avoid\nthinking them ridiculous and offensive to a sober good man. So that,\nin effect, religion, which should most distinguish us from beasts,\nand ought most peculiarly to elevate us, as rational creatures, above\nbrutes, is that wherein men often appear most irrational, and more\nsenseless than beasts themselves. CREDO, QUIA IMPOSSIBILE EST: I\nbelieve, because it is impossible, might, in a good man, pass for a\nsally of zeal; but would prove a very ill rule for men to choose their\nopinions or religion by.\nCHAPTER XIX. [not in early editions]\nCHAPTER XX.\nOF WRONG ASSENT, OR ERROR.\n1. Causes of Error, or how men come to give assent contrary to\nprobability.\nKNOWLEDGE being to be had only of visible and certain truth, ERROR is\nnot a fault of our knowledge, but a mistake of our judgment giving\nassent to that which is not true.\nBut if assent be grounded on likelihood, if the proper object and motive\nof our assent be probability, and that probability consists in what is\nlaid down in the foregoing chapters, it will be demanded HOW MEN COME TO\nGIVE THEIR ASSENTS CONTRARY TO PROBABILITY. For there is nothing more\ncommon than contrariety of opinions; nothing more obvious than that\none man wholly disbelieves what another only doubts of, and a third\nsteadfastly believes and firmly adheres to.\nThe reasons whereof, though they may be very various, yet, I suppose may\nall be reduced to these four:\nI. WANT OF PROOFS.\nII. WANT OF ABILITY TO USE THEM.\nIII. WANT OF WILL TO SEE THEM.\nIV. WRONG MEASURES OF PROBABILITY.\n2. First cause of Error, Want of Proofs.\nFIRST, By WANT OF PROOFS, I do not mean only the want of those proofs\nwhich are nowhere extant, and so are nowhere to be had; but the want\neven of those proofs which are in being, or might be procured. And thus\nmen want proofs, who have not the convenience or opportunity to make\nexperiments and observations themselves, tending to the proof of any\nproposition; nor likewise the convenience to inquire into and collect\nthe testimonies of others: and in this state are the greatest part of\nmankind, who are given up to labour, and enslaved to the necessity of\ntheir mean condition, whose lives are worn out only in the provisions\nfor living. These men's opportunities of knowledge and inquiry are\ncommonly as narrow as their fortunes; and their understandings are but\nlittle instructed, when all their whole time and pains is laid out to\nstill the croaking of their own bellies, or the cries of their children.\nIt is not to be expected that a man who drudges on all his life in a\nlaborious trade, should be more knowing in the variety of things done\nin the world than a packhorse, who is driven constantly forwards and\nbackwards in a narrow lane and dirty road, only to market, should be\nskilled in the geography of the country. Nor is it at all more possible,\nthat he who wants leisure, books, and languages, and the opportunity\nof conversing with variety of men, should be in a condition to collect\nthose testimonies and observations which are in being, and are necessary\nto make out many, nay most, of the propositions that, in the societies\nof men, are judged of the greatest moment; or to find out grounds of\nassurance so great as the belief of the points he would build on them is\nthought necessary. So that a great part of mankind are, by the natural\nand unalterable state of things in this world, and the constitution of\nhuman affairs, unavoidably given over to invincible ignorance of those\nproofs on which others build, and which are necessary to establish those\nopinions: the greatest part of men, having much to do to get the means\nof living, are not in a condition to look after those of learned and\nlaborious inquiries.\n3. Objection, What shall become of those who want Proofs? Answered.\nWhat shall we say, then? Are the greatest part of mankind, by the\nnecessity of their condition, subjected to unavoidable ignorance, in\nthose things which are of greatest importance to them? (for of those\nit is obvious to inquire.) Have the bulk of mankind no other guide but\naccident and blind chance to conduct them to their happiness or\nmisery? Are the current opinions, and licensed guides of every country\nsufficient evidence and security to every man to venture his great\nconcernments on; nay, his everlasting happiness or misery? Or can those\nbe the certain and infallible oracles and standards of truth, which\nteach one thing in Christendom and another in Turkey? Or shall a poor\ncountryman be eternally happy, for having the chance to be born in\nItaly; or a day-labourer be unavoidably lost, because he had the\nill-luck to be born in England? How ready some men may be to say some of\nthese things, I will not here examine: but this I am sure, that men must\nallow one or other of these to be true, (let them choose which they\nplease,) or else grant that God has furnished men with faculties\nsufficient to direct them in the way they should take, if they will but\nseriously employ them that way, when their ordinary vocations allow them\nthe leisure. No man is so wholly taken up with the attendance on the\nmeans of living, as to have no spare time at all to think of his soul,\nand inform himself in matters of religion. Were men as intent upon this\nas they are on things of lower concernment, there are none so enslaved\nto the necessities of life who might not find many vacancies that might\nbe husbanded to this advantage of their knowledge.\n4. People hindered from Inquiry.\nBesides those whose improvements and informations are straitened by\nthe narrowness of their fortunes, there are others whose largeness of\nfortune would plentifully enough supply books, and other requisites for\nclearing of doubts, and discovering of truth: but they are cooped in\nclose, by the laws of their countries, and the strict guards of those\nwhose interest it is to keep them ignorant, lest, knowing more, they\nshould believe the less in them. These are as far, nay further, from\nthe liberty and opportunities of a fair inquiry, than these poor and\nwretched labourers we before spoke of: and however they may seem high\nand great, are confined to narrowness of thought, and enslaved in that\nwhich should be the freest part of man, their understandings. This is\ngenerally the case of all those who live in places where care is taken\nto propagate truth without knowledge; where men are forced, at a\nventure, to be of the religion of the country; and must therefore\nswallow down opinions, as silly people do empiric's pills, without\nknowing what they are made of, or how they will work, and having nothing\nto do but believe that they will do the cure: but in this are much\nmore miserable than they, in that they are not at liberty to refuse\nswallowing what perhaps they had rather let alone; or to choose the\nphysician, to whose conduct they would trust themselves.\n5. Second Cause of Error, Want of skill to use Proofs.\nSECONDLY, Those who WANT SKILL TO USE THOSE EVIDENCES THEY HAVE OF\nPROBABILITIES; who cannot carry a train of consequences in their heads;\nnor weigh exactly the preponderancy of contrary proofs and testimonies,\nmaking every circumstance its due allowance; may be easily misled to\nassent to positions that are not probable. There are some men of one,\nsome but of two syllogisms, and no more; and others that can but advance\none step further. These cannot always discern that side on which the\nstrongest proofs lie; cannot constantly follow that which in itself is\nthe more probable opinion. Now that there is such a difference between\nmen, in respect of their understandings, I think nobody, who has had any\nconversation with his neighbours, will question: though he never was at\nWestminster-Hall or the Exchange on the one hand, nor at Alms-houses\nor Bedlam on the other. Which great difference in men's intellectuals,\nwhether it rises from any defect in the organs of the body, particularly\nadapted to thinking; or in the dulness or untractableness of those\nfaculties for want of use; or, as some think, in the natural differences\nof men's souls themselves; or some, or all of these together; it matters\nnot here to examine: only this is evident, that there is a difference of\ndegrees in men's understandings, apprehensions, and reasonings, to so\ngreat a latitude, that one may, without doing injury to mankind, affirm,\nthat there is a greater distance between some men and others in this\nrespect, than between some men and some beasts. But how this comes about\nis a speculation, though of great consequence, yet not necessary to our\npresent purpose.\n6. Third cause of Error, Want of Will to use them.\nTHIRDLY, There are another sort of people that want proofs, not because\nthey are out of their reach, but BECAUSE THEY WILL NOT USE THEM: who,\nthough they have riches and leisure enough, and want neither parts nor\nlearning, may yet, through their hot pursuit of pleasure, or business,\nor else out of laziness or fear that the doctrines whose truth they\nwould inquire into would not suit well with their opinions, lives or\ndesigns, may never come to the knowledge of, nor give their assent to,\nthose possibilities which lie so much within their view, that, to be\nconvinced of them, they need but turn their eyes that way. We know some\nmen will not read a letter which is supposed to bring ill news; and many\nmen forbear to cast up their accounts, or so much as think upon their\nestates, who have reason to fear their affairs are in no very good\nposture. How men, whose plentiful fortunes allow them leisure to improve\ntheir understandings, can satisfy themselves with a lazy ignorance, I\ncannot tell: but methinks they have a low opinion of their souls, who\nlay out all their incomes in provisions for the body, and employ none of\nit to procure the means and helps of knowledge; who take great care to\nappear always in a neat and splendid outside, and would think themselves\nmiserable in coarse clothes, or a patched coat, and yet contentedly\nsuffer their minds to appear abroad in a piebald livery of coarse\npatches and borrowed shreds, such as it has pleased chance, or their\ncountry tailor (I mean the common opinion of those they have conversed\nwith) to clothe them in. I will not here mention how unreasonable this\nis for men that ever think of a future state, and their concernment in\nit, which no rational man can avoid to do sometimes: nor shall I take\nnotice what a shame and confusion it is to the greatest contemners of\nknowledge, to be found ignorant in things they are concerned to\nknow. But this at least is worth the consideration of those who call\nthemselves gentlemen, That, however they may think credit, respect,\npower, and authority the concomitants of their birth and fortune, yet\nthey will find all these still carried away from them by men of lower\ncondition, who surpass them in knowledge. They who are blind will\nalways be led by those that see, or else fall into the ditch: and he\nis certainly the most subjected, the most enslaved, who is so in his\nunderstanding. In the foregoing instances some of the causes have been\nshown of wrong assent, and how it comes to pass, that probable doctrines\nare not always received with an assent proportionable to the reasons\nwhich are to be had for their probability: but hitherto we have\nconsidered only such probabilities whose proofs do exist, but do not\nappear to him who embraces the error.\n7. Fourth cause of Error, Wrong Measures of Probability: which are--\nFOURTHLY, There remains yet the last sort, who, even where the real\nprobabilities appear, and are plainly laid before them, do not admit\nof the conviction, nor yield unto manifest reasons, but do either\nsuspend their assent, or give it to the less probable opinion. And\nto this danger are those exposed who have taken up WRONG MEASURES OF\nPROBABILITY, which are:\nI. PROPOSITIONS THAT ARE IN THEMSELVES CERTAIN AND EVIDENT, BUT DOUBTFUL\nAND FALSE, TAKEN UP FOR PRINCIPLES.\nII. RECEIVED HYPOTHESES.\nIII. PREDOMINANT PASSIONS OR INCLINATIONS.\nIV. AUTHORITY.\n8. I. Doubtful Propositions taken for Principles.\nThe first and firmest ground of probability is the conformity anything\nhas to our own knowledge; especially that part of our knowledge which\nwe have embraced, and continue to look on as PRINCIPLES. These have so\ngreat an influence upon our opinions, that it is usually by them we\njudge of truth, and measure probability; to that degree, that what is\ninconsistent with our principles, is so far from passing for probable\nwith us, that it will not be allowed possible. The reverence borne to\nthese principles is so great, and their authority so paramount to all\nother, that the testimony, not only of other men, but the evidence of\nour own senses are often rejected, when they offer to vouch anything\ncontrary to these established rules. How much the doctrine of INNATE\nPRINCIPLES, and that principles are not to be proved or questioned, has\ncontributed to this, I will not here examine. This I readily grant, that\none truth cannot contradict another: but withal I take leave also to\nsay, that every one ought very carefully to beware what he admits for a\nprinciple, to examine it strictly, and see whether he certainly knows it\nto be true of itself, by its own evidence, or whether he does only with\nassurance believe it to be so, upon the authority of others. For he\nhath a strong bias put into his understanding, which will unavoidably\nmisguide his assent, who hath imbibed WRONG PRINCIPLES, and has blindly\ngiven himself up to the authority of any opinion in itself not evidently\ntrue.\n9. Instilled in childhood.\nThere is nothing more ordinary than children's receiving into their\nminds propositions (especially about matters of religion) from their\nparents, nurses, or those about them: which being insinuated into their\nunwary as well as unbiassed understandings, and fastened by degrees, are\nat last (equally whether true or false) riveted there by long custom and\neducation, beyond all possibility of being pulled out again. For men,\nwhen they are grown up, reflecting upon their opinions, and finding\nthose of this sort to be as ancient in their minds as their very\nmemories, not having observed their early insinuation, nor by what means\nthey got them, they are apt to reverence them as sacred things, and not\nto suffer them to be profaned, touched, or questioned: they look on\nthem as the Urim and Thummim set up in their minds immediately by God\nhimself, to be the great and unerring deciders of truth and falsehood,\nand the judges to which they are to appeal in all manner of\ncontroversies.\n10. Of irresistible efficacy.\nThis opinion of his principles (let them be what they will) being once\nestablished in any one's mind, it is easy to be imagined what reception\nany proposition shall find, how clearly soever proved, that shall\ninvalidate their authority, or at all thwart with these internal\noracles; whereas the grossest absurdities and improbabilities, being but\nagreeable to such principles, go down glibly, and are easily digested.\nThe great obstinacy that is to be found in men firmly believing quite\ncontrary opinions, though many times equally absurd, in the various\nreligions of mankind, are as evident a proof as they are an unavoidable\nconsequence of this way of reasoning from received traditional\nprinciples. So that men will disbelieve their own eyes, renounce the\nevidence of their senses, and give their own experience the lie, rather\nthan admit of anything disagreeing with these sacred tenets. Take an\nintelligent Romanist that, from the first dawning of any notions in his\nunderstanding, hath had this principle constantly inculcated, viz. that\nhe must believe as the church (i.e. those of his communion) believes,\nor that the pope is infallible, and this he never so much as heard\nquestioned, till at forty or fifty years old he met with one of other\nprinciples: how is he prepared easily to swallow, not only against all\nprobability, but even the clear evidence of his senses, the doctrine of\nTRANSUBSTANTIATION? This principle has such an influence on his mind,\nthat he will believe that to be flesh which he sees to be bread. And\nwhat way will you take to convince a man of any improbable opinion he\nholds, who, with some philosophers, hath laid down this as a foundation\nof reasoning, That he must believe his reason (for so men improperly\ncall arguments drawn from their principles) against his senses? Let an\nenthusiast be principled that he or his teacher is inspired, and acted\nby an immediate communication of the Divine Spirit, and you in vain\nbring the evidence of clear reasons against his doctrine. Whoever,\ntherefore, have imbibed wrong principles, are not, in things\ninconsistent with these principles, to be moved by the most apparent\nand convincing probabilities, till they are so candid and ingenuous to\nthemselves, as to be persuaded to examine even those very principles,\nwhich many never suffer themselves to do.\n11. Received Hypotheses.\nNext to these are men whose understandings are cast into a mould, and\nfashioned just to the size of a received HYPOTHESIS. The difference\nbetween these and the former, is, that they will admit of matter of\nfact, and agree with dissenters in that; but differ only in assigning of\nreasons and explaining the manner of operation. These are not at that\nopen defiance with their senses, with the former: they can endure to\nhearken to their information a little more patiently; but will by no\nmeans admit of their reports in the explanation of things; nor be\nprevailed on by probabilities, which would convince them that things\nare not brought about just after the same manner that they have decreed\nwithin themselves that they are. Would it not be an insufferable thing\nfor a learned professor, and that which his scarlet would blush at, to\nhave his authority of forty years standing, wrought out of hard rock,\nGreek and Latin, with no small expense of time and candle, and confirmed\nby general tradition and a reverend beard, in an instant overturned\nby an upstart novelist? Can any one expect that he should be made to\nconfess, that what he taught his scholars thirty years ago was all error\nand mistake; and that he sold them hard words and ignorance at a very\ndear rate. What probabilities, I say, are sufficient to prevail in such\na case? And who ever, by the most cogent arguments, will be prevailed\nwith to disrobe himself at once of all his old opinions, and pretences\nto knowledge and learning, which with hard study he hath all this time\nbeen labouring for; and turn himself out stark naked, in quest afresh of\nnew notions? All the arguments that can be used will be as little able\nto prevail, as the wind did with the traveller to part with his cloak,\nwhich he held only the faster. To this of wrong hypothesis may be\nreduced the errors that may be occasioned by a true hypothesis, or right\nprinciples, but not rightly understood. There is nothing more familiar\nthan this. The instances of men contending for different opinions, which\nthey all derive from the infallible truth of the Scripture, are an\nundeniable proof of it. All that call themselves Christians, allow the\ntext that says,[word in Greek], to carry in it the obligation to a very\nweighty duty. But yet how very erroneous will one of their practices\nbe, who, understanding nothing but the French, take this rule with one\ntranslation to be, REPENTEZ-VOUS, repent; or with the other, FATIEZ\nPENITENCE, do penance.\n12. III. Predominant Passions.\nProbabilities which cross men's appetites and prevailing passions run\nthe same fate. Let ever so much probability hang on one side of a\ncovetous man's reasoning, and money on the other; it is easy to foresee\nwhich will outweigh. Earthly minds, like mud walls, resist the strongest\nbatteries: and though, perhaps, sometimes the force of a clear argument\nmay make some impression, yet they nevertheless stand firm, and keep\nout the enemy, truth, that would captivate or disturb them. Tell a man\npassionately in love, that he is jilted; bring a score of witnesses of\nthe falsehood of his mistress, it is ten to one but three kind words\nof hers shall invalidate all their testimonies. QUOD VOLUMUS, FACILE\nCREDIMUS; what suits our wishes, is forwardly believed, is, I suppose,\nwhat every one hath more than once experimented: and though men cannot\nalways openly gainsay or resist the force of manifest probabilities that\nmake against them, yet yield they not to the argument. Not but that it\nis the nature of the understanding constantly to close with the more\nprobable side; but yet a man hath a power to suspend and restrain its\ninquiries, and not permit a full and satisfactory examination, as far as\nthe matter in question is capable, and will bear it to be made. Until\nthat be done, there will be always these two ways left of evading the\nmost apparent probabilities:\n13. Two Means of evading Probabilities: 1. Supposed Fallacy latent in\nthe words employed.\nFirst, That the arguments being (as for the most part they are) brought\nin words, THERE MAY BE A FALLACY LATENT IN THEM: and the consequences\nbeing, perhaps, many in train, they may be some of them incoherent.\nThere are very few discourses so short, clear, and consistent, to which\nmost men may not, with satisfaction enough to themselves, raise this\ndoubt; and from whose conviction they may not, without reproach of\ndisingenuity or unreasonableness, set themselves free with the old\nreply, Non persuadebis, etiamsi persuaseris; though I cannot answer, I\nwill not yield.\n14. Supposed unknown Arguments for the contrary.\nSecondly, Manifest probabilities maybe evaded, and the assent withheld,\nupon this suggestion, That I know not yet all that may be said on the\ncontrary side. And therefore, though I be beaten, it is not necessary I\nshould yield, not knowing what forces there are in reserve behind. This\nis a refuge against conviction so open and so wide, that it is hard to\ndetermine when a man is quite out of the verge of it.\n15. What Probabilities naturally determine the Assent.\nBut yet there is some end of it; and a man having carefully inquired\ninto all the grounds of probability and unlikeliness; done his utmost to\ninform himself in all particulars fairly, and cast up the sum total on\nboth sides; may, in most cases, come to acknowledge, upon the whole\nmatter, on which side the probability rests: wherein some proofs in\nmatter of reason, being suppositions upon universal experience, are so\ncogent and clear, and some testimonies in matter of fact so universal,\nthat he cannot refuse his assent. So that I think we may conclude, that,\nin propositions, where though the proofs in view are of most moment, yet\nthere are sufficient grounds to suspect that there is either fallacy in\nwords, or certain proofs as considerable to be produced on the contrary\nside; there assent, suspense, or dissent, are often voluntary actions.\nBut where the proofs are such as make it highly probable, and there is\nnot sufficient ground to suspect that there is either fallacy of words\n(which sober and serious consideration may discover) nor equally valid\nproofs yet undiscovered, latent on the other side (which also the nature\nof the thing may, in some cases, make plain to a considerate man;)\nthere, I think, a man who has weighed them can scarce refuse his assent\nto the side on which the greater probability appears. Whether it be\nprobable that a promiscuous jumble of printing letters should often\nfall into a method and order, which should stamp on paper a coherent\ndiscourse; or that a blind fortuitous concourse of atoms, not guided by\nan understanding agent, should frequently constitute the bodies of any\nspecies of animals: in these and the like cases, I think, nobody that\nconsiders them can be one jot at a stand which side to take, nor at all\nwaver in his assent. Lastly, when there can be no supposition (the thing\nin its own nature indifferent, and wholly depending upon the testimony\nof witnesses) that there is as fair testimony against, as for the matter\nof fact attested; which by inquiry is to be learned, v.g. whether there\nwas one thousand seven hundred years ago such a man at Rome as Julius\nCaesar: in all such cases, I say, I think it is not in any rational\nman's power to refuse his assent; but that it necessarily follows, and\ncloses with such probabilities. In other less clear cases, I think it is\nin man's power to suspend his assent; and perhaps content himself with\nthe proofs he has, if they favour the opinion that suits with his\ninclination or interest, and so stop from further search. But that a\nman should afford his assent to that side on which the less probability\nappears to him, seems to me utterly impracticable, and as impossible\nas it is to believe the same thing probable and improbable at the same\ntime.\n16. Where it is in our Power to suspend our Judgment.\nAs knowledge is no more arbitrary than perception; so, I think, assent\nis no more in our power than knowledge. When the agreement of any two\nideas appears to our minds, whether immediately or by the assistance of\nreason, I can no more refuse to perceive, no more avoid knowing it, than\nI can avoid seeing those objects which I turn my eyes to, and look on\nin daylight; and what upon full examination I find the most probable, I\ncannot deny my assent to. But, though we cannot hinder our knowledge,\nwhere the agreement is once perceived; nor our assent, where the\nprobability manifestly appears upon due consideration of all the\nmeasures of it: yet we can hinder both KNOWLEDGE and ASSENT, BY STOPPING\nOUR INQUIRY, and not employing our faculties in the search of any truth.\nIf it were not so, ignorance, error, or infidelity, could not in any\ncase be a fault. Thus, in some cases we can prevent or suspend our\nassent: but can a man versed in modern or ancient history doubt whether\nthere is such a place as Rome, or whether there was such a man as Julius\nCaesar? Indeed, there are millions of truths that a man is not, or may\nnot think himself concerned to know; as whether our king Richard the\nThird was crooked or no; or whether Roger Bacon was a mathematician or\na magician. In these and such like cases, where the assent one way or\nother is of no importance to the interest of any one; no action, no\nconcernment of his following or depending thereon, there it is not\nstrange that the mind should give itself up to the common opinion, or\nrender itself to the first comer. These and the like opinions are of so\nlittle weight and moment, that, like motes in the sun, their tendencies\nare very rarely taken notice of. They are there, as it were, by chance,\nand the mind lets them float at liberty. But where the mind judges that\nthe proposition has concernment in it: where the assent or not assenting\nis thought to draw consequences of moment after it, and good and evil to\ndepend on choosing or refusing the right side, and the mind sets itself\nseriously to inquire and examine the probability: there I think it is\nnot in our choice to take which side we please, if manifest odds appear\non either. The greater probability, I think, in that case will determine\nthe assent: and a man can no more avoid assenting, or taking it to be\ntrue, where he perceives the greater probability, than he can avoid\nknowing it to be true, where he perceives the agreement or disagreement\nof any two ideas.\nIf this be so, the foundation of error will lie in wrong measures of\nprobability; as the foundation of vice in wrong measures of good.\n17. IV. Authority\nThe fourth and last wrong measure of probability I shall take notice of,\nand which keeps in ignorance or error more people than all the other\ntogether, is that which I have mentioned in the foregoing chapter: I\nmean the giving up our assent to the common received opinions, either\nof our friends or party, neighbourhood or country. How many men have no\nother ground for their tenets, than the supposed honesty, or learning,\nor number of those of the same profession? As if honest or bookish\nmen could not err; or truth were to be established by the vote of the\nmultitude: yet this with most men serves the turn. The tenet has had the\nattestation of reverend antiquity; it comes to me with the passport of\nformer ages, and therefore I am secure in the reception I give it: other\nmen have been and are of the same opinion, (for that is all is said,)\nand therefore it is reasonable for me to embrace it. A man may more\njustifiably throw up cross and pile for his opinions, than take them up\nby such measures. All men are liable to error, and most men are in many\npoints, by passion or interest, under temptation to it. If we could but\nsee the secret motives that influenced the men of name and learning in\nthe world, and the leaders of parties, we should not always find that it\nwas the embracing of truth for its own sake, that made them espouse the\ndoctrines they owned and maintained. This at least is certain, there is\nnot an opinion so absurd, which a man may not receive upon this ground.\nThere is no error to be named, which has not had its professors: and a\nman shall never want crooked paths to walk in, if he thinks that he is\nin the right way, wherever he has the footsteps of others to follow. 18.\nNot so many men in Errors as is commonly supposed.\nBut, notwithstanding the great noise is made in the world about errors\nand opinions, I must do mankind that right as to say, THERE ARE NOT SO\nMANY MEN IN ERRORS AND WRONG OPINIONS AS IS COMMONLY SUPPOSED. Not that\nI think they embrace the truth; but indeed, because concerning those\ndoctrines they keep such a stir about, they have no thought, no opinion\nat all. For if any one should a little catechise the greatest part of\nthe partizans of most of the sects in the world, he would not find,\nconcerning those matters they are so zealous for, that they have any\nopinions of their own: much less would he have reason to think that\nthey took them upon the examination of arguments and appearance of\nprobability. They are resolved to stick to a party that education or\ninterest has engaged them in; and there, like the common soldiers of an\narmy, show their courage and warmth as their leaders direct, without\never examining, or so much as knowing, the cause they contend for. If a\nman's life shows that he has no serious regard for religion; for what\nreason should we think that he beats his head about the opinions of his\nchurch, and troubles himself to examine the grounds of this or that\ndoctrine? It is enough for him to obey his leaders, to have his hand\nand his tongue ready for the support of the common cause, and thereby\napprove himself to those who can give him credit, preferment, or\nprotection in that society. Thus men become professors of, and\ncombatants for, those opinions they were never convinced of nor\nproselytes to; no, nor ever had so much as floating in their heads: and\nthough one cannot say there are fewer improbable or erroneous opinions\nin the world than there are, yet this is certain; there are fewer that\nactually assent to them, and mistake them for truths, than is imagined.\nCHAPTER XXI.\nOF THE DIVISION OF THE SCIENCES.\n1. Science may be divided into three sorts.\nAll that can fall within the compass of human understanding, being\neither, FIRST, the nature of things, as they are in themselves, their\nrelations, and their manner of operation: or, SECONDLY, that which\nman himself ought to do, as a rational and voluntary agent, for the\nattainment of any end, especially happiness: or, THIRDLY, the ways and\nmeans whereby the knowledge of both the one and the other of these is\nattained and communicated; I think science may be divided properly into\nthese three sorts:--\n2. First, Physica.\nFIRST, The knowledge of things, as they are in their own proper beings,\nthen constitution, properties, and operations; whereby I mean not only\nmatter and body, but spirits also, which have their proper natures,\nconstitutions, and operations, as well as bodies. This, in a little more\nenlarged sense of the word, I call [word in Greek: physika], or NATURAL\nPHILOSOPHY. The end of this is bare speculative truth: and whatsoever\ncan afford the mind of man any such, falls under this branch, whether it\nbe God himself, angels, spirits, bodies; or any of their affections, as\nnumber, and figure, &c.\n3. Secondly, Practica.\nSECONDLY, [word in Greek: praktika], The skill of right applying our own\npowers and actions, for the attainment of things good and useful. The\nmost considerable under this head is ETHICS, which is the seeking out\nthose rules and measures of human actions, which lead to happiness, and\nthe means to practise them. The end of this is not bare speculation and\nthe knowledge of truth; but right, and a conduct suitable to it.\n4. Thirdly, [word in Greek: Semeiotika]\nTHIRDLY, the third branch may be called [word in Greek: Semeiotika], or\nTHE DOCTRINE OF SIGNS; the most usual whereof being words, it is aptly\nenough termed also [word in Greek: Logika], LOGIC: the business whereof\nis to consider the nature of signs, the mind makes use of for the\nunderstanding of things, or conveying its knowledge to others. For,\nsince the things the mind contemplates are none of them, besides itself,\npresent to the understanding, it is necessary that something else, as a\nsign or representation of the thing it considers, should be present to\nit: and these are IDEAS. And because the scene of ideas that makes one\nman's thoughts cannot be laid open to the immediate view of another, nor\nlaid up anywhere but in the memory, a no very sure repository: therefore\nto communicate our thoughts to one another, as well as record them for\nour own use, signs of our ideas are also necessary: those which men\nhave found most convenient, and therefore generally make use of, are\nARTICULATE SOUNDS. The consideration, then, of IDEAS and WORDS as the\ngreat instruments of knowledge, makes no despicable part of their\ncontemplation who would take a view of human knowledge in the whole\nextent of it. And perhaps if they were distinctly weighed, and duly\nconsidered, they would afford us another sort of logic and critic, than\nwhat we have been hitherto acquainted with.\n5. This is the first and most general Division of the Objects of our\nUnderstanding.\nThis seems to me the first and most general, as well as natural division\nof the objects of our understanding. For a man can employ his thoughts\nabout nothing, but either, the contemplation of THINGS themselves, for\nthe discovery of truth; or about the things in his own power, which are\nhis own ACTIONS, for the attainment of his own ends; or the SIGNS the\nmind makes use of both in the one and the other, and the right ordering\nof them, for its clearer information. All which three, viz. THINGS, as\nthey are in themselves knowable; ACTIONS as they depend on us, in order\nto happiness; and the right use of SIGNS in order to knowledge, being\nTOTO COELO different, they seemed to me to be the three great provinces\nof the intellectual world, wholly separate and distinct one from\nanother.\nThe End", "source": "essay_human_understanding_vol2.txt"}

OF THE ASSOCIATION OF IDEAS.\nTO THE RIGHT HONOURABLE THOMAS, EARL OF PEMBROKE AND MONTGOMERY, BARON\nHERBERT OF CARDIFF LORD ROSS, OF KENDAL, PAR, FITZHUGH, MARMION, ST.\nQUINTIN, AND SHURLAND;\nLORD PRESIDENT OF HIS MAJESTY\u2019S MOST HONOURABLE PRIVY COUNCIL; AND LORD\nLIEUTENANT OF THE COUNTY OF WILTS, AND OF SOUTH WALES.\nMY LORD,\nThis Treatise, which is grown up under your lordship\u2019s eye, and has\nventured into the world by your order, does now, by a natural kind of\nright, come to your lordship for that protection which you several\nyears since promised it. It is not that I think any name, how great\nsoever, set at the beginning of a book, will be able to cover the\nfaults that are to be found in it. Things in print must stand and fall\nby their own worth, or the reader\u2019s fancy. But there being nothing more\nto be desired for truth than a fair unprejudiced hearing, nobody is\nmore likely to procure me that than your lordship, who are allowed to\nhave got so intimate an acquaintance with her, in her more retired\nrecesses. Your lordship is known to have so far advanced your\nspeculations in the most abstract and general knowledge of things,\nbeyond the ordinary reach or common methods, that your allowance and\napprobation of the design of this Treatise will at least preserve it\nfrom being condemned without reading, and will prevail to have those\nparts a little weighed, which might otherwise perhaps be thought to\ndeserve no consideration, for being somewhat out of the common road.\nThe imputation of Novelty is a terrible charge amongst those who judge\nof men\u2019s heads, as they do of their perukes, by the fashion, and can\nallow none to be right but the received doctrines. Truth scarce ever\nyet carried it by vote anywhere at its first appearance: new opinions\nare always suspected, and usually opposed, without any other reason but\nbecause they are not already common. But truth, like gold, is not the\nless so for being newly brought out of the mine. It is trial and\nexamination must give it price, and not any antique fashion; and though\nit be not yet current by the public stamp, yet it may, for all that, be\nas old as nature, and is certainly not the less genuine. Your lordship\ncan give great and convincing instances of this, whenever you please to\noblige the public with some of those large and comprehensive\ndiscoveries you have made of truths hitherto unknown, unless to some\nfew, from whom your lordship has been pleased not wholly to conceal\nthem. This alone were a sufficient reason, were there no other, why I\nshould dedicate this Essay to your lordship; and its having some little\ncorrespondence with some parts of that nobler and vast system of the\nsciences your lordship has made so new, exact, and instructive a\ndraught of, I think it glory enough, if your lordship permit me to\nboast, that here and there I have fallen into some thoughts not wholly\ndifferent from yours. If your lordship think fit that, by your\nencouragement, this should appear in the world, I hope it may be a\nreason, some time or other, to lead your lordship further; and you will\nallow me to say, that you here give the world an earnest of something\nthat, if they can bear with this, will be truly worth their\nexpectation. This, my lord, shows what a present I here make to your\nlordship; just such as the poor man does to his rich and great\nneighbour, by whom the basket of flowers or fruit is not ill taken,\nthough he has more plenty of his own growth, and in much greater\nperfection. Worthless things receive a value when they are made the\nofferings of respect, esteem, and gratitude: these you have given me so\nmighty and peculiar reasons to have, in the highest degree, for your\nlordship, that if they can add a price to what they go along with,\nproportionable to their own greatness, I can with confidence brag, I\nhere make your lordship the richest present you ever received. This I\nam sure, I am under the greatest obligations to seek all occasions to\nacknowledge a long train of favours I have received from your lordship;\nfavours, though great and important in themselves, yet made much more\nso by the forwardness, concern, and kindness, and other obliging\ncircumstances, that never failed to accompany them. To all this you are\npleased to add that which gives yet more weight and relish to all the\nrest: you vouchsafe to continue me in some degrees of your esteem, and\nallow me a place in your good thoughts, I had almost said friendship.\nThis, my lord, your words and actions so constantly show on all\noccasions, even to others when I am absent, that it is not vanity in me\nto mention what everybody knows: but it would be want of good manners\nnot to acknowledge what so many are witnesses of, and every day tell me\nI am indebted to your lordship for. I wish they could as easily assist\nmy gratitude, as they convince me of the great and growing engagements\nit has to your lordship. This I am sure, I should write of the\nUNDERSTANDING without having any, if I were not extremely sensible of\nthem, and did not lay hold on this opportunity to testify to the world\nhow much I am obliged to be, and how much I am,\nMY LORD,\nYour Lordship\u2019s most humble and most obedient servant,\nJOHN LOCKE\n2 Dorset Court, 24th of May, 1689\nTHE EPISTLE TO THE READER\nREADER,\nI have put into thy hands what has been the diversion of some of my\nidle and heavy hours. If it has the good luck to prove so of any of\nthine, and thou hast but half so much pleasure in reading as I had in\nwriting it, thou wilt as little think thy money, as I do my pains, ill\nbestowed. Mistake not this for a commendation of my work; nor conclude,\nbecause I was pleased with the doing of it, that therefore I am fondly\ntaken with it now it is done. He that hawks at larks and sparrows has\nno less sport, though a much less considerable quarry, than he that\nflies at nobler game: and he is little acquainted with the subject of\nthis treatise\u2014the UNDERSTANDING\u2014who does not know that, as it is the\nmost elevated faculty of the soul, so it is employed with a greater and\nmore constant delight than any of the other. Its searches after truth\nare a sort of hawking and hunting, wherein the very pursuit makes a\ngreat part of the pleasure. Every step the mind takes in its progress\ntowards Knowledge makes some discovery, which is not only new, but the\nbest too, for the time at least.\nFor the understanding, like the eye, judging of objects only by its own\nsight, cannot but be pleased with what it discovers, having less regret\nfor what has escaped it, because it is unknown. Thus he who has raised\nhimself above the alms-basket, and, not content to live lazily on\nscraps of begged opinions, sets his own thoughts on work, to find and\nfollow truth, will (whatever he lights on) not miss the hunter\u2019s\nsatisfaction; every moment of his pursuit will reward his pains with\nsome delight; and he will have reason to think his time not ill spent,\neven when he cannot much boast of any great acquisition.\nThis, Reader, is the entertainment of those who let loose their own\nthoughts, and follow them in writing; which thou oughtest not to envy\nthem, since they afford thee an opportunity of the like diversion, if\nthou wilt make use of thy own thoughts in reading. It is to them, if\nthey are thy own, that I refer myself: but if they are taken upon trust\nfrom others, it is no great matter what they are; they are not\nfollowing truth, but some meaner consideration; and it is not worth\nwhile to be concerned what he says or thinks, who says or thinks only\nas he is directed by another. If thou judgest for thyself I know thou\nwilt judge candidly, and then I shall not be harmed or offended,\nwhatever be thy censure. For though it be certain that there is nothing\nin this Treatise of the truth whereof I am not fully persuaded, yet I\nconsider myself as liable to mistakes as I can think thee, and know\nthat this book must stand or fall with thee, not by any opinion I have\nof it, but thy own. If thou findest little in it new or instructive to\nthee, thou art not to blame me for it. It was not meant for those that\nhad already mastered this subject, and made a thorough acquaintance\nwith their own understandings; but for my own information, and the\nsatisfaction of a few friends, who acknowledged themselves not to have\nsufficiently considered it.\nWere it fit to trouble thee with the history of this Essay, I should\ntell thee, that five or six friends meeting at my chamber, and\ndiscoursing on a subject very remote from this, found themselves\nquickly at a stand, by the difficulties that rose on every side. After\nwe had awhile puzzled ourselves, without coming any nearer a resolution\nof those doubts which perplexed us, it came into my thoughts that we\ntook a wrong course; and that before we set ourselves upon inquiries of\nthat nature, it was necessary to examine our own abilities, and see\nwhat OBJECTS our understandings were, or were not, fitted to deal with.\nThis I proposed to the company, who all readily assented; and thereupon\nit was agreed that this should be our first inquiry. Some hasty and\nundigested thoughts, on a subject I had never before considered, which\nI set down against our next meeting, gave the first entrance into this\nDiscourse; which having been thus begun by chance, was continued by\nintreaty; written by incoherent parcels; and after long intervals of\nneglect, resumed again, as my humour or occasions permitted; and at\nlast, in a retirement where an attendance on my health gave me leisure,\nit was brought into that order thou now seest it.\nThis discontinued way of writing may have occasioned, besides others,\ntwo contrary faults, viz., that too little and too much may be said in\nit. If thou findest anything wanting, I shall be glad that what I have\nwritten gives thee any desire that I should have gone further. If it\nseems too much to thee, thou must blame the subject; for when I put pen\nto paper, I thought all I should have to say on this matter would have\nbeen contained in one sheet of paper; but the further I went the larger\nprospect I had; new discoveries led me still on, and so it grew\ninsensibly to the bulk it now appears in. I will not deny, but possibly\nit might be reduced to a narrower compass than it is, and that some\nparts of it might be contracted, the way it has been writ in, by\ncatches, and many long intervals of interruption, being apt to cause\nsome repetitions. But to confess the truth, I am now too lazy, or too\nbusy, to make it shorter. I am not ignorant how little I herein consult\nmy own reputation, when I knowingly let it go with a fault, so apt to\ndisgust the most judicious, who are always the nicest readers. But they\nwho know sloth is apt to content itself with any excuse, will pardon me\nif mine has prevailed on me, where I think I have a very good one. I\nwill not therefore allege in my defence, that the same notion, having\ndifferent respects, may be convenient or necessary to prove or\nillustrate several parts of the same discourse, and that so it has\nhappened in many parts of this: but waiving that, I shall frankly avow\nthat I have sometimes dwelt long upon the same argument, and expressed\nit different ways, with a quite different design. I pretend not to\npublish this Essay for the information of men of large thoughts and\nquick apprehensions; to such masters of knowledge I profess myself a\nscholar, and therefore warn them beforehand not to expect anything\nhere, but what, being spun out of my own coarse thoughts, is fitted to\nmen of my own size, to whom, perhaps, it will not be unacceptable that\nI have taken some pains to make plain and familiar to their thoughts\nsome truths which established prejudice, or the abstractedness of the\nideas themselves, might render difficult. Some objects had need be\nturned on every side; and when the notion is new, as I confess some of\nthese are to me; or out of the ordinary road, as I suspect they will\nappear to others, it is not one simple view of it that will gain it\nadmittance into every understanding, or fix it there with a clear and\nlasting impression. There are few, I believe, who have not observed in\nthemselves or others, that what in one way of proposing was very\nobscure, another way of expressing it has made very clear and\nintelligible; though afterwards the mind found little difference in the\nphrases, and wondered why one failed to be understood more than the\nother. But everything does not hit alike upon every man\u2019s imagination.\nWe have our understandings no less different than our palates; and he\nthat thinks the same truth shall be equally relished by every one in\nthe same dress, may as well hope to feast every one with the same sort\nof cookery: the meat may be the same, and the nourishment good, yet\nevery one not be able to receive it with that seasoning; and it must be\ndressed another way, if you will have it go down with some, even of\nstrong constitutions. The truth is, those who advised me to publish it,\nadvised me, for this reason, to publish it as it is: and since I have\nbeen brought to let it go abroad, I desire it should be understood by\nwhoever gives himself the pains to read it. I have so little affection\nto be in print, that if I were not flattered this Essay might be of\nsome use to others, as I think it has been to me, I should have\nconfined it to the view of some friends, who gave the first occasion to\nit. My appearing therefore in print being on purpose to be as useful as\nI may, I think it necessary to make what I have to say as easy and\nintelligible to all sorts of readers as I can. And I had much rather\nthe speculative and quick-sighted should complain of my being in some\nparts tedious, than that any one, not accustomed to abstract\nspeculations, or prepossessed with different notions, should mistake or\nnot comprehend my meaning.\nIt will possibly be censured as a great piece of vanity or insolence in\nme, to pretend to instruct this our knowing age; it amounting to little\nless, when I own, that I publish this Essay with hopes it may be useful\nto others. But, if it may be permitted to speak freely of those who\nwith a feigned modesty condemn as useless what they themselves write,\nmethinks it savours much more of vanity or insolence to publish a book\nfor any other end; and he fails very much of that respect he owes the\npublic, who prints, and consequently expects men should read, that\nwherein he intends not they should meet with anything of use to\nthemselves or others: and should nothing else be found allowable in\nthis Treatise, yet my design will not cease to be so; and the goodness\nof my intention ought to be some excuse for the worthlessness of my\npresent. It is that chiefly which secures me from the fear of censure,\nwhich I expect not to escape more than better writers. Men\u2019s\nprinciples, notions, and relishes are so different, that it is hard to\nfind a book which pleases or displeases all men. I acknowledge the age\nwe live in is not the least knowing, and therefore not the most easy to\nbe satisfied. If I have not the good luck to please, yet nobody ought\nto be offended with me. I plainly tell all my readers, except half a\ndozen, this Treatise was not at first intended for them; and therefore\nthey need not be at the trouble to be of that number. But yet if any\none thinks fit to be angry and rail at it, he may do it securely, for I\nshall find some better way of spending my time than in such kind of\nconversation. I shall always have the satisfaction to have aimed\nsincerely at truth and usefulness, though in one of the meanest ways.\nThe commonwealth of learning is not at this time without\nmaster-builders, whose mighty designs, in advancing the sciences, will\nleave lasting monuments to the admiration of posterity: but every one\nmust not hope to be a Boyle or a Sydenham; and in an age that produces\nsuch masters as the great Huygenius and the incomparable Mr. Newton,\nwith some others of that strain, it is ambition enough to be employed\nas an under-labourer in clearing the ground a little, and removing some\nof the rubbish that lies in the way to knowledge;\u2014which certainly had\nbeen very much more advanced in the world, if the endeavours of\ningenious and industrious men had not been much cumbered with the\nlearned but frivolous use of uncouth, affected, or unintelligible\nterms, introduced into the sciences, and there made an art of, to that\ndegree that Philosophy, which is nothing but the true knowledge of\nthings, was thought unfit or incapable to be brought into well-bred\ncompany and polite conversation. Vague and insignificant forms of\nspeech, and abuse of language, have so long passed for mysteries of\nscience; and hard and misapplied words, with little or no meaning,\nhave, by prescription, such a right to be mistaken for deep learning\nand height of speculation, that it will not be easy to persuade either\nthose who speak or those who hear them, that they are but the covers of\nignorance, and hindrance of true knowledge. To break in upon the\nsanctuary of vanity and ignorance will be, I suppose, some service to\nhuman understanding; though so few are apt to think they deceive or are\ndeceived in the use of words; or that the language of the sect they are\nof has any faults in it which ought to be examined or corrected, that I\nhope I shall be pardoned if I have in the Third Book dwelt long on this\nsubject, and endeavoured to make it so plain, that neither the\ninveterateness of the mischief, nor the prevalency of the fashion,\nshall be any excuse for those who will not take care about the meaning\nof their own words, and will not suffer the significancy of their\nexpressions to be inquired into.\nI have been told that a short Epitome of this Treatise, which was\nprinted in 1688, was by some condemned without reading, because INNATE\nIDEAS were denied in it; they too hastily concluding, that if innate\nideas were not supposed, there would be little left either of the\nnotion or proof of spirits. If any one take the like offence at the\nentrance of this Treatise, I shall desire him to read it through; and\nthen I hope he will be convinced, that the taking away false\nfoundations is not to the prejudice but advantage of truth, which is\nnever injured or endangered so much as when mixed with, or built on,\nfalsehood. In the Second Edition I added as followeth:\u2014\nThe bookseller will not forgive me if I say nothing of this New\nEdition, which he has promised, by the correctness of it, shall make\namends for the many faults committed in the former. He desires too,\nthat it should be known that it has one whole new chapter concerning\nIdentity, and many additions and amendments in other places. These I\nmust inform my reader are not all new matter, but most of them either\nfurther confirmation of what I had said, or explications, to prevent\nothers being mistaken in the sense of what was formerly printed, and\nnot any variation in me from it.\nI must only except the alterations I have made in Book II. chap. xxi.\nWhat I had there written concerning Liberty and the Will, I thought\ndeserved as accurate a view as I am capable of; those subjects having\nin all ages exercised the learned part of the world with questions and\ndifficulties, that have not a little perplexed morality and divinity,\nthose parts of knowledge that men are most concerned to be clear in.\nUpon a closer inspection into the working of men\u2019s minds, and a\nstricter examination of those motives and views they are turned by, I\nhave found reason somewhat to alter the thoughts I formerly had\nconcerning that which gives the last determination to the Will in all\nvoluntary actions. This I cannot forbear to acknowledge to the world\nwith as much freedom and readiness; as I at first published what then\nseemed to me to be right; thinking myself more concerned to quit and\nrenounce any opinion of my own, than oppose that of another, when truth\nappears against it. For it is truth alone I seek, and that will always\nbe welcome to me, when or from whencesoever it comes. But what\nforwardness soever I have to resign any opinion I have, or to recede\nfrom anything I have writ, upon the first evidence of any error in it;\nyet this I must own, that I have not had the good luck to receive any\nlight from those exceptions I have met with in print against any part\nof my book, nor have, from anything that has been urged against it,\nfound reason to alter my sense in any of the points that have been\nquestioned. Whether the subject I have in hand requires often more\nthought and attention than cursory readers, at least such as are\nprepossessed, are willing to allow; or whether any obscurity in my\nexpressions casts a cloud over it, and these notions are made difficult\nto others\u2019 apprehensions in my way of treating them; so it is, that my\nmeaning, I find, is often mistaken, and I have not the good luck to be\neverywhere rightly understood.\nOf this the ingenious author of the Discourse Concerning the Nature of\nMan has given me a late instance, to mention no other. For the civility\nof his expressions, and the candour that belongs to his order, forbid\nme to think that he would have closed his Preface with an insinuation,\nas if in what I had said, Book II. ch. xxvii, concerning the third rule\nwhich men refer their actions to, I went about to make virtue vice and\nvice virtue, unless he had mistaken my meaning; which he could not have\ndone if he had given himself the trouble to consider what the argument\nwas I was then upon, and what was the chief design of that chapter,\nplainly enough set down in the fourth section and those following. For\nI was there not laying down moral rules, but showing the original and\nnature of moral ideas, and enumerating the rules men make use of in\nmoral relations, whether these rules were true or false: and pursuant\nthereto I tell what is everywhere called virtue and vice; which \u201calters\nnot the nature of things,\u201d though men generally do judge of and\ndenominate their actions according to the esteem and fashion of the\nplace and sect they are of.\nIf he had been at the pains to reflect on what I had said, Bk. I. ch.\nii. sect. 18, and Bk. II. ch. xxviii. sect. 13, 14, 15 and 20, he would\nhave known what I think of the eternal and unalterable nature of right\nand wrong, and what I call virtue and vice. And if he had observed that\nin the place he quotes I only report as a matter of fact what OTHERS\ncall virtue and vice, he would not have found it liable to any great\nexception. For I think I am not much out in saying that one of the\nrules made use of in the world for a ground or measure of a moral\nrelation is\u2014that esteem and reputation which several sorts of actions\nfind variously in the several societies of men, according to which they\nare there called virtues or vices. And whatever authority the learned\nMr. Lowde places in his Old English Dictionary, I daresay it nowhere\ntells him (if I should appeal to it) that the same action is not in\ncredit, called and counted a virtue, in one place, which, being in\ndisrepute, passes for and under the name of vice in another. The taking\nnotice that men bestow the names of \u2018virtue\u2019 and \u2018vice\u2019 according to\nthis rule of Reputation is all I have done, or can be laid to my charge\nto have done, towards the making vice virtue or virtue vice. But the\ngood man does well, and as becomes his calling, to be watchful in such\npoints, and to take the alarm even at expressions, which, standing\nalone by themselves, might sound ill and be suspected.\n\u2018Tis to this zeal, allowable in his function, that I forgive his citing\nas he does these words of mine (ch. xxviii. sect. II): \u201cEven the\nexhortations of inspired teachers have not feared to appeal to common\nrepute, Philip, iv. 8;\u201d without taking notice of those immediately\npreceding, which introduce them, and run thus: \u201cWhereby even in the\ncorruption of manners, the true boundaries of the law of nature, which\nought to be the rule of virtue and vice, were pretty well preserved. So\nthat even the exhortations of inspired teachers,\u201d &c. By which words,\nand the rest of that section, it is plain that I brought that passage\nof St. Paul, not to prove that the general measure of what men called\nvirtue and vice throughout the world was the reputation and fashion of\neach particular society within itself; but to show that, though it were\nso, yet, for reasons I there give, men, in that way of denominating\ntheir actions, did not for the most part much stray from the Law of\nNature; which is that standing and unalterable rule by which they ought\nto judge of the moral rectitude and gravity of their actions, and\naccordingly denominate them virtues or vices. Had Mr. Lowde considered\nthis, he would have found it little to his purpose to have quoted this\npassage in a sense I used it not; and would I imagine have spared the\napplication he subjoins to it, as not very necessary. But I hope this\nSecond Edition will give him satisfaction on the point, and that this\nmatter is now so expressed as to show him there was no cause for\nscruple.\nThough I am forced to differ from him in these apprehensions he has\nexpressed, in the latter end of his preface, concerning what I had said\nabout virtue and vice, yet we are better agreed than he thinks in what\nhe says in his third chapter (p. 78) concerning \u201cnatural inscription\nand innate notions.\u201d I shall not deny him the privilege he claims (p.\n52), to state the question as he pleases, especially when he states it\nso as to leave nothing in it contrary to what I have said. For,\naccording to him, \u201cinnate notions, being conditional things, depending\nupon the concurrence of several other circumstances in order to the\nsoul\u2019s exerting them,\u201d all that he says for \u201cinnate, imprinted,\nimpressed notions\u201d (for of innate IDEAS he says nothing at all),\namounts at last only to this\u2014that there are certain propositions which,\nthough the soul from the beginning, or when a man is born, does not\nknow, yet \u201cby assistance from the outward senses, and the help of some\nprevious cultivation,\u201d it may AFTERWARDS come certainly to know the\ntruth of; which is no more than what I have affirmed in my First Book.\nFor I suppose by the \u201csoul\u2019s exerting them,\u201d he means its beginning to\nknow them; or else the soul\u2019s \u2018exerting of notions\u2019 will be to me a\nvery unintelligible expression; and I think at best is a very unfit one\nin this, it misleading men\u2019s thoughts by an insinuation, as if these\nnotions were in the mind before the \u2018soul exerts them,\u2019 i. e. before\nthey are known;\u2014whereas truly before they are known, there is nothing\nof them in the mind but a capacity to know them, when the \u2018concurrence\nof those circumstances,\u2019 which this ingenious author thinks necessary\n\u2018in order to the soul\u2019s exerting them,\u2019 brings them into our knowledge.\nP. 52 I find him express it thus: \u2018These natural notions are not so\nimprinted upon the soul as that they naturally and necessarily exert\nthemselves (even in children and idiots) without any assistance from\nthe outward senses, or without the help of some previous cultivation.\u2019\nHere, he says, they \u2018exert themselves,\u2019 as p. 78, that the \u2018soul exerts\nthem.\u2019 When he has explained to himself or others what he means by \u2018the\nsoul\u2019s exerting innate notions,\u2019 or their \u2018exerting themselves;\u2019 and\nwhat that \u2018previous cultivation and circumstances\u2019 in order to their\nbeing exerted are\u2014he will I suppose find there is so little of\ncontroversy between him and me on the point, bating that he calls that\n\u2018exerting of notions\u2019 which I in a more vulgar style call \u2018knowing,\u2019\nthat I have reason to think he brought in my name on this occasion only\nout of the pleasure he has to speak civilly of me; which I must\ngratefully acknowledge he has done everywhere he mentions me, not\nwithout conferring on me, as some others have done, a title I have no\nright to.\nThere are so many instances of this, that I think it justice to my\nreader and myself to conclude, that either my book is plainly enough\nwritten to be rightly understood by those who peruse it with that\nattention and indifferency, which every one who will give himself the\npains to read ought to employ in reading; or else that I have written\nmine so obscurely that it is in vain to go about to mend it. Whichever\nof these be the truth, it is myself only am affected thereby; and\ntherefore I shall be far from troubling my reader with what I think\nmight be said in answer to those several objections I have met with, to\npassages here and there of my book; since I persuade myself that he who\nthinks them of moment enough to be concerned whether they are true or\nfalse, will be able to see that what is said is either not well\nfounded, or else not contrary to my doctrine, when I and my opposer\ncome both to be well understood.\nIf any other authors, careful that none of their good thoughts should\nbe lost, have published their censures of my Essay, with this honour\ndone to it, that they will not suffer it to be an essay, I leave it to\nthe public to value the obligation they have to their critical pens,\nand shall not waste my reader\u2019s time in so idle or ill-natured an\nemployment of mine, as to lessen the satisfaction any one has in\nhimself, or gives to others, in so hasty a confutation of what I have\nwritten.\nThe booksellers preparing for the Fourth Edition of my Essay, gave me\nnotice of it, that I might, if I had leisure, make any additions or\nalterations I should think fit. Whereupon I thought it convenient to\nadvertise the reader, that besides several corrections I had made here\nand there, there was one alteration which it was necessary to mention,\nbecause it ran through the whole book, and is of consequence to be\nrightly understood. What I thereupon said was this:\u2014\nCLEAR and DISTINCT ideas are terms which, though familiar and frequent\nin men\u2019s mouths, I have reason to think every one who uses does not\nperfectly understand. And possibly \u2018tis but here and there one who\ngives himself the trouble to consider them so far as to know what he\nhimself or others precisely mean by them. I have therefore in most\nplaces chose to put DETERMINATE or DETERMINED, instead of CLEAR and\nDISTINCT, as more likely to direct men\u2019s thoughts to my meaning in this\nmatter. By those denominations, I mean some object in the mind, and\nconsequently determined, i. e. such as it is there seen and perceived\nto be. This, I think, may fitly be called a determinate or determined\nidea, when such as it is at any time objectively in the mind, and so\ndetermined there, it is annexed, and without variation determined, to a\nname or articulate sound, which is to be steadily the sign of that very\nsame object of the mind, or determinate idea.\nTo explain this a little more particularly. By DETERMINATE, when\napplied to a simple idea, I mean that simple appearance which the mind\nhas in its view, or perceives in itself, when that idea is said to be\nin it: by DETERMINED, when applied to a complex idea, I mean such an\none as consists of a determinate number of certain simple or less\ncomplex ideas, joined in such a proportion and situation as the mind\nhas before its view, and sees in itself, when that idea is present in\nit, or should be present in it, when a man gives a name to it. I say\nSHOULD be, because it is not every one, nor perhaps any one, who is so\ncareful of his language as to use no word till he views in his mind the\nprecise determined idea which he resolves to make it the sign of. The\nwant of this is the cause of no small obscurity and confusion in men\u2019s\nthoughts and discourses.\nI know there are not words enough in any language to answer all the\nvariety of ideas that enter into men\u2019s discourses and reasonings. But\nthis hinders not but that when any one uses any term, he may have in\nhis mind a determined idea, which he makes it the sign of, and to which\nhe should keep it steadily annexed during that present discourse. Where\nhe does not, or cannot do this, he in vain pretends to clear or\ndistinct ideas: it is plain his are not so; and therefore there can be\nexpected nothing but obscurity and confusion, where such terms are made\nuse of which have not such a precise determination.\nUpon this ground I have thought determined ideas a way of speaking less\nliable to mistakes, than clear and distinct: and where men have got\nsuch determined ideas of all that they reason, inquire, or argue about,\nthey will find a great part of their doubts and disputes at an end; the\ngreatest part of the questions and controversies that perplex mankind\ndepending on the doubtful and uncertain use of words, or (which is the\nsame) indetermined ideas, which they are made to stand for. I have made\nchoice of these terms to signify, (1) Some immediate object of the\nmind, which it perceives and has before it, distinct from the sound it\nuses as a sign of it. (2) That this idea, thus determined, i.e. which\nthe mind has in itself, and knows, and sees there, be determined\nwithout any change to that name, and that name determined to that\nprecise idea. If men had such determined ideas in their inquiries and\ndiscourses, they would both discern how far their own inquiries and\ndiscourses went, and avoid the greatest part of the disputes and\nwranglings they have with others.\nBesides this, the bookseller will think it necessary I should advertise\nthe reader that there is an addition of two chapters wholly new; the\none of the Association of Ideas, the other of Enthusiasm. These, with\nsome other larger additions never before printed, he has engaged to\nprint by themselves, after the same manner, and for the same purpose,\nas was done when this Essay had the second impression.\nIn the Sixth Edition there is very little added or altered. The\ngreatest part of what is new is contained in the twenty-first chapter\nof the second book, which any one, if he thinks it worth while, may,\nwith a very little labour, transcribe into the margin of the former\nedition.\nESSAY CONCERNING HUMANE UNDERSTANDING.\nBOOK I\nNEITHER PRINCIPLES NOR IDEAS ARE INNATE\nCHAPTER I.\nINTRODUCTION.\n1. An Inquiry into the Understanding pleasant and useful.\nSince it is the UNDERSTANDING that sets man above the rest of sensible\nbeings, and gives him all the advantage and dominion which he has over\nthem; it is certainly a subject, even for its nobleness, worth our\nlabour to inquire into. The understanding, like the eye, whilst it\nmakes us see and perceive all other things, takes no notice of itself;\nand it requires and art and pains to set it at a distance and make it\nits own object. But whatever be the difficulties that lie in the way of\nthis inquiry; whatever it be that keeps us so much in the dark to\nourselves; sure I am that all the light we can let in upon our minds,\nall the acquaintance we can make with our own understandings, will not\nonly be very pleasant, but bring us great advantage, in directing our\nthoughts in the search of other things.\n2. Design.\nThis, therefore, being my purpose\u2014to inquire into the original,\ncertainty, and extent of HUMAN KNOWLEDGE, together with the grounds and\ndegrees of BELIEF, OPINION, and ASSENT;\u2014I shall not at present meddle\nwith the physical consideration of the mind; or trouble myself to\nexamine wherein its essence consists; or by what motions of our spirits\nor alterations of our bodies we come to have any SENSATION by our\norgans, or any IDEAS in our understandings; and whether those ideas do\nin their formation, any or all of them, depend on matter or not. These\nare speculations which, however curious and entertaining, I shall\ndecline, as lying out of my way in the design I am now upon. It shall\nsuffice to my present purpose, to consider the discerning faculties of\na man, as they are employed about the objects which they have to do\nwith. And I shall imagine I have not wholly misemployed myself in the\nthoughts I shall have on this occasion, if, in this historical, plain\nmethod, I can give any account of the ways whereby our understandings\ncome to attain those notions of things we have; and can set down any\nmeasures of the certainty of our knowledge; or the grounds of those\npersuasions which are to be found amongst men, so various, different,\nand wholly contradictory; and yet asserted somewhere or other with such\nassurance and confidence, that he that shall take a view of the\nopinions of mankind, observe their opposition, and at the same time\nconsider the fondness and devotion wherewith they are embraced, the\nresolution and eagerness wherewith they are maintained, may perhaps\nhave reason to suspect, that either there is no such thing as truth at\nall, or that mankind hath no sufficient means to attain a certain\nknowledge of it.\n3. Method.\nIt is therefore worth while to search out the bounds between opinion\nand knowledge; and examine by what measures, in things whereof we have\nno certain knowledge, we ought to regulate our assent and moderate our\npersuasion. In order whereunto I shall pursue this following method:\u2014\nFirst, I shall inquire into the original of those ideas, notions, or\nwhatever else you please to call them, which a man observes, and is\nconscious to himself he has in his mind; and the ways whereby the\nunderstanding comes to be furnished with them.\nSecondly, I shall endeavour to show what knowledge the understanding\nhath by those ideas; and the certainty, evidence, and extent of it.\nThirdly, I shall make some inquiry into the nature and grounds of FAITH\nor OPINION: whereby I mean that assent which we give to any proposition\nas true, of whose truth yet we have no certain knowledge. And here we\nshall have occasion to examine the reasons and degrees of ASSENT.\n4. Useful to know the Extent of our Comprehension.\nIf by this inquiry into the nature of the understanding, I can discover\nthe powers thereof; how far they reach; to what things they are in any\ndegree proportionate; and where they fail us, I suppose it may be of\nuse to prevail with the busy mind of man to be more cautious in\nmeddling with things exceeding its comprehension; to stop when it is at\nthe utmost extent of its tether; and to sit down in a quiet ignorance\nof those things which, upon examination, are found to be beyond the\nreach of our capacities. We should not then perhaps be so forward, out\nof an affectation of an universal knowledge, to raise questions, and\nperplex ourselves and others with disputes about things to which our\nunderstandings are not suited; and of which we cannot frame in our\nminds any clear or distinct perceptions, or whereof (as it has perhaps\ntoo often happened) we have not any notions at all. If we can find out\nhow far the understanding can extend its view; how far it has faculties\nto attain certainty; and in what cases it can only judge and guess, we\nmay learn to content ourselves with what is attainable by us in this\nstate.\n5. Our Capacity suited to our State and Concerns.\nFor though the comprehension of our understandings comes exceeding\nshort of the vast extent of things, yet we shall have cause enough to\nmagnify the bountiful Author of our being, for that proportion and\ndegree of knowledge he has bestowed on us, so far above all the rest of\nthe inhabitants of this our mansion. Men have reason to be well\nsatisfied with what God hath thought fit for them, since he hath given\nthem (as St. Peter says) [words in Greek], whatsoever is necessary for\nthe conveniences of life and information of virtue; and has put within\nthe reach of their discovery, the comfortable provision for this life,\nand the way that leads to a better. How short soever their knowledge\nmay come of an universal or perfect comprehension of whatsoever is, it\nyet secures their great concernments, that they have light enough to\nlead them to the knowledge of their Maker, and the sight of their own\nduties. Men may find matter sufficient to busy their heads, and employ\ntheir hands with variety, delight, and satisfaction, if they will not\nboldly quarrel with their own constitution, and throw away the\nblessings their hands are filled with, because they are not big enough\nto grasp everything. We shall not have much reason to complain of the\nnarrowness of our minds, if we will but employ them about what may be\nof use to us; for of that they are very capable. And it will be an\nunpardonable, as well as childish peevishness, if we undervalue the\nadvantages of our knowledge, and neglect to improve it to the ends for\nwhich it was given us, because there are some things that are set out\nof the reach of it. It will be no excuse to an idle and untoward\nservant, who would not attend his business by candle light, to plead\nthat he had not broad sunshine. The Candle that is set up in us shines\nbright enough for all our purposes. The discoveries we can make with\nthis ought to satisfy us; and we shall then use our understandings\nright, when we entertain all objects in that way and proportion that\nthey are suited to our faculties, and upon those grounds they are\ncapable of being proposed to us; and not peremptorily or intemperately\nrequire demonstration, and demand certainty, where probability only is\nto be had, and which is sufficient to govern all our concernments. If\nwe will disbelieve everything, because we cannot certainly know all\nthings, we shall do much\u2014what as wisely as he who would not use his\nlegs, but sit still and perish, because he had no wings to fly.\n6. Knowledge of our Capacity a Cure of Scepticism and Idleness.\nWhen we know our own strength, we shall the better know what to\nundertake with hopes of success; and when we have well surveyed the\nPOWERS of our own minds, and made some estimate what we may expect from\nthem, we shall not be inclined either to sit still, and not set our\nthoughts on work at all, in despair of knowing anything; nor on the\nother side, question everything, and disclaim all knowledge, because\nsome things are not to be understood. It is of great use to the sailor\nto know the length of his line, though he cannot with it fathom all the\ndepths of the ocean. It is well he knows that it is long enough to\nreach the bottom, at such places as are necessary to direct his voyage,\nand caution him against running upon shoals that may ruin him. Our\nbusiness here is not to know all things, but those which concern our\nconduct. If we can find out those measures, whereby a rational\ncreature, put in that state in which man is in this world, may and\nought to govern his opinions, and actions depending thereon, we need\nnot to be troubled that some other things escape our knowledge.\n7. Occasion of this Essay.\nThis was that which gave the first rise to this Essay concerning the\nunderstanding. For I thought that the first step towards satisfying\nseveral inquiries the mind of man was very apt to run into, was, to\ntake a survey of our own understandings, examine our own powers, and\nsee to what things they were adapted. Till that was done I suspected we\nbegan at the wrong end, and in vain sought for satisfaction in a quiet\nand sure possession of truths that most concerned us, whilst we let\nloose our thoughts into the vast ocean of Being; as if all that\nboundless extent were the natural and undoubted possession of our\nunderstandings, wherein there was nothing exempt from its decisions, or\nthat escaped its comprehension. Thus men, extending their inquiries\nbeyond their capacities, and letting their thoughts wander into those\ndepths where they can find no sure footing, it is no wonder that they\nraise questions and multiply disputes, which, never coming to any clear\nresolution, are proper only to continue and increase their doubts, and\nto confirm them at last in perfect scepticism. Whereas, were the\ncapacities of our understandings well considered, the extent of our\nknowledge once discovered, and the horizon found which sets the bounds\nbetween the enlightened and dark parts of things; between what is and\nwhat is not comprehensible by us, men would perhaps with less scruple\nacquiesce in the avowed ignorance of the one, and employ their thoughts\nand discourse with more advantage and satisfaction in the other.\n8. What Idea stands for.\nThus much I thought necessary to say concerning the occasion of this\ninquiry into human Understanding. But, before I proceed on to what I\nhave thought on this subject, I must here in the entrance beg pardon of\nmy reader for the frequent use of the word IDEA, which he will find in\nthe following treatise. It being that term which, I think, serves best\nto stand for whatsoever is the OBJECT of the understanding when a man\nthinks, I have used it to express whatever is meant by PHANTASM,\nNOTION, SPECIES, or WHATEVER IT IS WHICH THE MIND CAN BE EMPLOYED ABOUT\nIN THINKING; and I could not avoid frequently using it. I presume it\nwill be easily granted me, that there are such IDEAS in men\u2019s minds:\nevery one is conscious of them in himself; and men\u2019s words and actions\nwill satisfy him that they are in others.\nOur first inquiry then shall be,\u2014how they come into the mind.\nCHAPTER II.\nNO INNATE SPECULATIVE PRINCIPLES.\n1. The way shown how we come by any Knowledge, sufficient to prove it\nnot innate.\nIt is an established opinion amongst some men, that there are in the\nunderstanding certain INNATE PRINCIPLES; some primary notions, \u039a\u03bf\u03b9\u03bd\u1f70\u03b9\n\u03b5\u1f54\u03bd\u03bf\u03b9\u03b1\u03b9, characters, as it were stamped upon the mind of man; which the\nsoul receives in its very first being, and brings into the world with\nit. It would be sufficient to convince unprejudiced readers of the\nfalseness of this supposition, if I should only show (as I hope I shall\nin the following parts of this Discourse) how men, barely by the use of\ntheir natural faculties may attain to all the knowledge they have,\nwithout the help of any innate impressions; and may arrive at\ncertainty, without any such original notions or principles. For I\nimagine any one will easily grant that it would be impertinent to\nsuppose the ideas of colours innate in a creature to whom God hath\ngiven sight, and a power to receive them by the eyes from external\nobjects: and no less unreasonable would it be to attribute several\ntruths to the impressions of nature, and innate characters, when we may\nobserve in ourselves faculties fit to attain as easy and certain\nknowledge of them as if they were originally imprinted on the mind.\nBut because a man is not permitted without censure to follow his own\nthoughts in the search of truth, when they lead him ever so little out\nof the common road, I shall set down the reasons that made me doubt of\nthe truth of that opinion, as an excuse for my mistake, if I be in one;\nwhich I leave to be considered by those who, with me, dispose\nthemselves to embrace truth wherever they find it.\n2. General Assent the great Argument.\nThere is nothing more commonly taken for granted than that there are\ncertain PRINCIPLES, both SPECULATIVE and PRACTICAL, (for they speak of\nboth), universally agreed upon by all mankind: which therefore, they\nargue, must needs be the constant impressions which the souls of men\nreceive in their first beings, and which they bring into the world with\nthem, as necessarily and really as they do any of their inherent\nfaculties.\n3. Universal Consent proves nothing innate.\nThis argument, drawn from universal consent, has this misfortune in it,\nthat if it were true in matter of fact, that there were certain truths\nwherein all mankind agreed, it would not prove them innate, if there\ncan be any other way shown how men may come to that universal\nagreement, in the things they do consent in, which I presume may be\ndone.\n4. \u201cWhat is is,\u201d and \u201cIt is possible for the same Thing to be and not\nto be,\u201d not universally assented to.\nBut, which is worse, this argument of universal consent, which is made\nuse of to prove innate principles, seems to me a demonstration that\nthere are none such: because there are none to which all mankind give\nan universal assent. I shall begin with the speculative, and instance\nin those magnified principles of demonstration, \u201cWhatsoever is, is,\u201d\nand \u201cIt is impossible for the same thing to be and not to be\u201d; which,\nof all others, I think have the most allowed title to innate. These\nhave so settled a reputation of maxims universally received, that it\nwill no doubt be thought strange if any one should seem to question it.\nBut yet I take liberty to say, that these propositions are so far from\nhaving an universal assent, that there are a great part of mankind to\nwhom they are not so much as known.\n5. Not on Mind naturally imprinted, because not known to Children,\nIdiots, &c.\nFor, first, it is evident, that all children and idiots have not the\nleast apprehension or thought of them. And the want of that is enough\nto destroy that universal assent which must needs be the necessary\nconcomitant of all innate truths: it seeming to me near a contradiction\nto say, that there are truths imprinted on the soul, which it perceives\nor understands not: imprinting, if it signify anything, being nothing\nelse but the making certain truths to be perceived. For to imprint\nanything on the mind without the mind\u2019s perceiving it, seems to me\nhardly intelligible. If therefore children and idiots have souls, have\nminds, with those impressions upon them, THEY must unavoidably perceive\nthem, and necessarily know and assent to these truths; which since they\ndo not, it is evident that there are no such impressions. For if they\nare not notions naturally imprinted, how can they be innate? and if\nthey are notions imprinted, how can they be unknown? To say a notion is\nimprinted on the mind, and yet at the same time to say, that the mind\nis ignorant of it, and never yet took notice of it, is to make this\nimpression nothing. No proposition can be said to be in the mind which\nit never yet knew, which it was never yet conscious of. For if any one\nmay, then, by the same reason, all propositions that are true, and the\nmind is capable ever of assenting to, may be said to be in the mind,\nand to be imprinted: since, if any one can be said to be in the mind,\nwhich it never yet knew, it must be only because it is capable of\nknowing it; and so the mind is of all truths it ever shall know. Nay,\nthus truths may be imprinted on the mind which it never did, nor ever\nshall know; for a man may live long, and die at last in ignorance of\nmany truths which his mind was capable of knowing, and that with\ncertainty. So that if the capacity of knowing be the natural impression\ncontended for, all the truths a man ever comes to know will, by this\naccount, be every one of them innate; and this great point will amount\nto no more, but only to a very improper way of speaking; which, whilst\nit pretends to assert the contrary, says nothing different from those\nwho deny innate principles. For nobody, I think, ever denied that the\nmind was capable of knowing several truths. The capacity, they say, is\ninnate; the knowledge acquired. But then to what end such contest for\ncertain innate maxims? If truths can be imprinted on the understanding\nwithout being perceived, I can see no difference there can be between\nany truths the mind is CAPABLE of knowing in respect of their original:\nthey must all be innate or all adventitious: in vain shall a man go\nabout to distinguish them. He therefore that talks of innate notions in\nthe understanding, cannot (if he intend thereby any distinct sort of\ntruths) mean such truths to be in the understanding as it never\nperceived, and is yet wholly ignorant of. For if these words \u201cto be in\nthe understanding\u201d have any propriety, they signify to be understood.\nSo that to be in the understanding, and not to be understood; to be in\nthe mind and never to be perceived, is all one as to say anything is\nand is not in the mind or understanding. If therefore these two\npropositions, \u201cWhatsoever is, is,\u201d and \u201cIt is impossible for the same\nthing to be and not to be,\u201d are by nature imprinted, children cannot be\nignorant of them: infants, and all that have souls, must necessarily\nhave them in their understandings, know the truth of them, and assent\nto it.\n6. That men know them when they come to the Use of Reason answered.\nTo avoid this, it is usually answered, that all men know and assent to\nthem, WHEN THEY COME TO THE USE OF REASON; and this is enough to prove\nthem innate. I answer:\n7. Doubtful expressions, that have scarce any signification, go for\nclear reasons to those who, being prepossessed, take not the pains to\nexamine even what they themselves say. For, to apply this answer with\nany tolerable sense to our present purpose, it must signify one of\nthese two things: either that as soon as men come to the use of reason\nthese supposed native inscriptions come to be known and observed by\nthem; or else, that the use and exercise of men\u2019s reason, assists them\nin the discovery of these principles, and certainly makes them known to\nthem.\n8. If Reason discovered them, that would not prove them innate.\nIf they mean, that by the use of reason men may discover these\nprinciples, and that this is sufficient to prove them innate; their way\nof arguing will stand thus, viz. that whatever truths reason can\ncertainly discover to us, and make us firmly assent to, those are all\nnaturally imprinted on the mind; since that universal assent, which is\nmade the mark of them, amounts to no more but this,\u2014that by the use of\nreason we are capable to come to a certain knowledge of and assent to\nthem; and, by this means, there will be no difference between the\nmaxims of the mathematicians, and theorems they deduce from them: all\nmust be equally allowed innate; they being all discoveries made by the\nuse of reason, and truths that a rational creature may certainly come\nto know, if he apply his thoughts rightly that way.\n9. It is false that Reason discovers them.\nBut how can these men think the use of reason necessary to discover\nprinciples that are supposed innate, when reason (if we may believe\nthem) is nothing else but the faculty of deducing unknown truths from\nprinciples or propositions that are already known? That certainly can\nnever be thought innate which we have need of reason to discover;\nunless, as I have said, we will have all the certain truths that reason\never teaches us, to be innate. We may as well think the use of reason\nnecessary to make our eyes discover visible objects, as that there\nshould be need of reason, or the exercise thereof, to make the\nunderstanding see what is originally engraven on it, and cannot be in\nthe understanding before it be perceived by it. So that to make reason\ndiscover those truths thus imprinted, is to say, that the use of reason\ndiscovers to a man what he knew before: and if men have those innate\nimpressed truths originally, and before the use of reason, and yet are\nalways ignorant of them till they come to the use of reason, it is in\neffect to say, that men know and know them not at the same time.\n10. No use made of reasoning in the discovery of these two maxims.\nIt will here perhaps be said that mathematical demonstrations, and\nother truths that are not innate, are not assented to as soon as\nproposed, wherein they are distinguished from these maxims and other\ninnate truths. I shall have occasion to speak of assent upon the first\nproposing, more particularly by and by. I shall here only, and that\nvery readily, allow, that these maxims and mathematical demonstrations\nare in this different: that the one have need of reason, using of\nproofs, to make them out and to gain our assent; but the other, as soon\nas understood, are, without any the least reasoning, embraced and\nassented to. But I withal beg leave to observe, that it lays open the\nweakness of this subterfuge, which requires the use of reason for the\ndiscovery of these general truths: since it must be confessed that in\ntheir discovery there is no use made of reasoning at all. And I think\nthose who give this answer will not be forward to affirm that the\nknowledge of this maxim, \u201cThat it is impossible for the same thing to\nbe and not to be,\u201d is a deduction of our reason. For this would be to\ndestroy that bounty of nature they seem so fond of, whilst they make\nthe knowledge of those principles to depend on the labour of our\nthoughts. For all reasoning is search, and casting about, and requires\npains and application. And how can it with any tolerable sense be\nsupposed, that what was imprinted by nature, as the foundation and\nguide of our reason, should need the use of reason to discover it?\n11. And if there were this would prove them not innate.\nThose who will take the pains to reflect with a little attention on the\noperations of the understanding, will find that this ready assent of\nthe mind to some truths, depends not, either on native inscription, or\nthe use of reason, but on a faculty of the mind quite distinct from\nboth of them, as we shall see hereafter. Reason, therefore, having\nnothing to do in procuring our assent to these maxims, if by saying,\nthat \u201cmen know and assent to them, when they come to the use of\nreason,\u201d be meant, that the use of reason assists us in the knowledge\nof these maxims, it is utterly false; and were it true, would prove\nthem not to be innate.\n12. The coming of the Use of Reason not the Time we come to know these\nMaxims.\nIf by knowing and assenting to them \u201cwhen we come to the use of\nreason,\u201d be meant, that this is the time when they come to be taken\nnotice of by the mind; and that as soon as children come to the use of\nreason, they come also to know and assent to these maxims; this also is\nfalse and frivolous. First, it is false; because it is evident these\nmaxims are not in the mind so early as the use of reason; and therefore\nthe coming to the use of reason is falsely assigned as the time of\ntheir discovery. How many instances of the use of reason may we observe\nin children, a long time before they have any knowledge of this maxim,\n\u201cThat it is impossible for the same thing to be and not to be?\u201d And a\ngreat part of illiterate people and savages pass many years, even of\ntheir rational age, without ever thinking on this and the like general\npropositions. I grant, men come not to the knowledge of these general\nand more abstract truths, which are thought innate, till they come to\nthe use of reason; and I add, nor then neither. Which is so, because,\ntill after they come to the use of reason, those general abstract ideas\nare not framed in the mind, about which those general maxims are, which\nare mistaken for innate principles, but are indeed discoveries made and\nverities introduced and brought into the mind by the same way, and\ndiscovered by the same steps, as several other propositions, which\nnobody was ever so extravagant as to suppose innate. This I hope to\nmake plain in the sequel of this Discourse. I allow therefore, a\nnecessity that men should come to the use of reason before they get the\nknowledge of those general truths; but deny that men\u2019s coming to the\nuse of reason is the time of their discovery.\n13. By this they are not distinguished from other knowable Truths.\nIn the mean time it is observable, that this saying that men know and\nassent to these maxims \u201cwhen they come to the use of reason,\u201d amounts\nin reality of fact to no more but this,\u2014that they are never known nor\ntaken notice of before the use of reason, but may possibly be assented\nto some time after, during a man\u2019s life; but when is uncertain. And so\nmay all other knowable truths, as well as these which therefore have no\nadvantage nor distinction from other by this note of being known when\nwe come to the use of reason; nor are thereby proved to be innate, but\nquite the contrary.\n14. If coming to the Use of Reason were the Time of their Discovery, it\nwould not prove them innate.\nBut, secondly, were it true that the precise time of their being known\nand assented to were, when men come to the use of reason; neither would\nthat prove them innate. This way of arguing is as frivolous as the\nsupposition itself is false. For, by what kind of logic will it appear\nthat any notion is originally by nature imprinted in the mind in its\nfirst constitution, because it comes first to be observed and assented\nto when a faculty of the mind, which has quite a distinct province,\nbegins to exert itself? And therefore the coming to the use of speech,\nif it were supposed the time that these maxims are first assented to,\n(which it may be with as much truth as the time when men come to the\nuse of reason,) would be as good a proof that they were innate, as to\nsay they are innate because men assent to them when they come to the\nuse of reason. I agree then with these men of innate principles, that\nthere is no knowledge of these general and self-evident maxims in the\nmind, till it comes to the exercise of reason: but I deny that the\ncoming to the use of reason is the precise time when they are first\ntaken notice of; and if that were the precise time, I deny that it\nwould prove them innate. All that can with any truth be meant by this\nproposition, that men \u2018assent to them when they come to the use of\nreason,\u2019 is no more but this,\u2014that the making of general abstract\nideas, and the understanding of general names, being a concomitant of\nthe rational faculty, and growing up with it, children commonly get not\nthose general ideas, nor learn the names that stand for them, till,\nhaving for a good while exercised their reason about familiar and more\nparticular ideas, they are, by their ordinary discourse and actions\nwith others, acknowledged to be capable of rational conversation. If\nassenting to these maxims, when men come to the use of reason, can be\ntrue in any other sense, I desire it may be shown; or at least, how in\nthis, or any other sense, it proves them innate.\n15. The Steps by which the Mind attains several Truths.\nThe senses at first let in PARTICULAR ideas, and furnish the yet empty\ncabinet, and the mind by degrees growing familiar with some of them,\nthey are lodged in the memory, and names got to them. Afterwards, the\nmind proceeding further, abstracts them, and by degrees learns the use\nof general names. In this manner the mind comes to be furnished with\nideas and language, the MATERIALS about which to exercise its\ndiscursive faculty. And the use of reason becomes daily more visible,\nas these materials that give it employment increase. But though the\nhaving of general ideas and the use of general words and reason usually\ngrow together, yet I see not how this any way proves them innate. The\nknowledge of some truths, I confess, is very early in the mind; but in\na way that shows them not to be innate. For, if we will observe, we\nshall find it still to be about ideas, not innate, but acquired; it\nbeing about those first which are imprinted by external things, with\nwhich infants have earliest to do, which make the most frequent\nimpressions on their senses. In ideas thus got, the mind discovers that\nsome agree and others differ, probably as soon as it has any use of\nmemory; as soon as it is able to retain and perceive distinct ideas.\nBut whether it be then or no, this is certain, it does so long before\nit has the use of words; or comes to that which we commonly call \u201cthe\nuse of reason.\u201d For a child knows as certainly before it can speak the\ndifference between the ideas of sweet and bitter (i.e. that sweet is\nnot bitter), as it knows afterwards (when it comes to speak) that\nwormwood and sugarplums are not the same thing.\n16. Assent to supposed innate truths depends on having clear and\ndistinct ideas of what their terms mean, and not on their innateness.\nA child knows not that three and four are equal to seven, till he comes\nto be able to count seven, and has got the name and idea of equality;\nand then, upon explaining those words, he presently assents to, or\nrather perceives the truth of that proposition. But neither does he\nthen readily assent because it is an innate truth, nor was his assent\nwanting till then because he wanted the use of reason; but the truth of\nit appears to him as soon as he has settled in his mind the clear and\ndistinct ideas that these names stand for. And then he knows the truth\nof that proposition upon the same ground and by the same means, that he\nknew before that a rod and a cherry are not the same thing; and upon\nthe same ground also that he may come to know afterwards \u201cThat it is\nimpossible for the same thing to be and not to be,\u201d as shall be more\nfully shown hereafter. So that the later it is before any one comes to\nhave those general ideas about which those maxims are; or to know the\nsignification of those generic terms that stand for them; or to put\ntogether in his mind the ideas they stand for; the later also will it\nbe before he comes to assent to those maxims;\u2014whose terms, with the\nideas they stand for, being no more innate than those of a cat or a\nweasel he must stay till time and observation have acquainted him with\nthem; and then he will be in a capacity to know the truth of these\nmaxims, upon the first occasion that shall make him put together those\nideas in his mind, and observe whether they agree or disagree,\naccording as is expressed in those propositions. And therefore it is\nthat a man knows that eighteen and nineteen are equal to thirty-seven,\nby the same self-evidence that he knows one and two to be equal to\nthree: yet a child knows this not so soon as the other; not for want of\nthe use of reason, but because the ideas the words eighteen nineteen,\nand thirty-seven stand for, are not so soon got, as those which are\nsignified by one, two, and three.\n17. Assenting as soon as proposed and understood, proves them not\ninnate.\nThis evasion therefore of general assent when men come to the use of\nreason, failing as it does, and leaving no difference between those\nsupposed innate and other truths that are afterwards acquired and\nlearnt, men have endeavoured to secure an universal assent to those\nthey call maxims, by saying, they are generally assented to as soon as\nproposed, and the terms they are proposed in understood: seeing all\nmen, even children, as soon as they hear and understand the terms,\nassent to these propositions, they think it is sufficient to prove them\ninnate. For, since men never fail after they have once understood the\nwords, to acknowledge them for undoubted truths, they would infer, that\ncertainly these propositions were first lodged in the understanding,\nwhich, without any teaching, the mind, at the very first proposal\nimmediately closes with and assents to, and after that never doubts\nagain.\n18. If such an Assent be a Mark of Innate, then \u201cthat one and two are\nequal to three, that Sweetness is not Bitterness,\u201d and a thousand the\nlike, must be innate.\nIn answer to this, I demand whether ready assent given to a\nproposition, upon first hearing and understanding the terms, be a\ncertain mark of an innate principle? If it be not, such a general\nassent is in vain urged as a proof of them: if it be said that it is a\nmark of innate, they must then allow all such propositions to be innate\nwhich are generally assented to as soon as heard, whereby they will\nfind themselves plentifully stored with innate principles. For upon the\nsame ground, viz. of assent at first hearing and understanding the\nterms, that men would have those maxims pass for innate, they must also\nadmit several propositions about numbers to be innate; and thus, that\none and two are equal to three, that two and two are equal to four, and\na multitude of other the like propositions in numbers, that everybody\nassents to at first hearing and understanding the terms, must have a\nplace amongst these innate axioms. Nor is this the prerogative of\nnumbers alone, and propositions made about several of them; but even\nnatural philosophy, and all the other sciences, afford propositions\nwhich are sure to meet with assent as soon as they are understood. That\n\u201ctwo bodies cannot be in the same place\u201d is a truth that nobody any\nmore sticks at than at these maxims, that \u201cit is impossible for the\nsame thing to be and not to be,\u201d that \u201cwhite is not black,\u201d that \u201ca\nsquare is not a circle,\u201d that \u201cbitterness is not sweetness.\u201d These and\na million of such other propositions, as many at least as we have\ndistinct ideas of, every man in his wits, at first hearing, and\nknowing, what the names stand for, must necessarily assent to. If these\nmen will be true to their own rule, and have assent at first hearing\nand understanding the terms to be a mark of innate, they must allow not\nonly as many innate propositions, as men have distinct ideas; but as\nmany as men can make propositions wherein, different ideas are denied\none of another. Since every proposition wherein one different idea is\ndenied of another, will as certainly find assent at first hearing and\nunderstanding the terms as this general one, \u201cIt is impossible for the\nsame thing to be and not to be,\u201d or that which is the foundation of it\nand is the easier understood of the two, \u201cThe same is not different\u201d;\nby which account they will have legions of innate propositions of this\none sort, without mentioning any other. But, since no proposition can\nbe innate unless the _ideas_ about which it is be innate, this will be\nto suppose all our ideas of colours, sounds, tastes, figure, &c.,\ninnate, than which there cannot be anything more opposite to reason and\nexperience. Universal and ready assent upon hearing and understanding\nthe terms is, I grant, a mark of self-evidence; but self-evidence,\ndepending not on innate impressions, but on something else, (as we\nshall show hereafter,) belongs to several propositions which nobody was\nyet so extravagant as to pretend to be innate.\n19. Such less general Propositions known before these universal Maxims.\nNor let it be said, that those more particular self-evident\npropositions, which are assented to at first hearing, as that \u201cone and\ntwo are equal to three,\u201d that \u201cgreen is not red,\u201d &c., are received as\nthe consequences of those more universal propositions which are looked\non as innate principles; since any one, who will but take the pains to\nobserve what passes in the understanding, will certainly find that\nthese, and the like less general propositions, are certainly known, and\nfirmly assented to by those who are utterly ignorant of those more\ngeneral maxims; and so, being earlier in the mind than those (as they\nare called) first principles, cannot owe to them the assent wherewith\nthey are received at first hearing.\n20. One and one equal to Two, &c., not general nor useful answered.\nIf it be said, that these propositions, viz. \u201ctwo and two are equal to\nfour,\u201d \u201cred is not blue,\u201d &c., are not general maxims nor of any great\nuse, I answer, that makes nothing to the argument of universal assent\nupon hearing and understanding. For, if that be the certain mark of\ninnate, whatever propositions can be found that receives general assent\nas soon as heard understood, that must be admitted for an innate\nproposition as well as this maxim, \u201cThat it is impossible for the same\nthing to be and not to be,\u201d they being upon this ground equal. And as\nto the difference of being more general, that makes this maxim more\nremote from being innate; those general and abstract ideas being more\nstrangers to our first apprehensions than those of more particular\nself-evident propositions; and therefore it is longer before they are\nadmitted, and assented to by the growing understanding. And as to the\nusefulness of these magnified maxims, that perhaps will not be found so\ngreat as is generally conceived, when it comes in its due place to be\nmore fully considered.\n21. These Maxims not being known sometimes till proposed, proves them\nnot innate.\nBut we have not yet done with \u201cassenting to propositions at first\nhearing and understanding their terms.\u201d It is fit we first take notice\nthat this, instead of being a mark that they are innate, is a proof of\nthe contrary; since it supposes that several, who understand and know\nother things, are ignorant of these principles till they are proposed\nto them; and that one may be unacquainted with these truths till he\nhears them from others. For, if they were innate, what need they be\nproposed in order to gaining assent, when, by being in the\nunderstanding, by a natural and original impression, (if there were any\nsuch,) they could not but be known before? Or doth the proposing them\nprint them clearer in the mind than nature did? If so, then the\nconsequence will be, that a man knows them better after he has been\nthus taught them than he did before. Whence it will follow that these\nprinciples may be made more evident to us by others\u2019 teaching than\nnature has made them by impression: which will ill agree with the\nopinion of innate principles, and give but little authority to them;\nbut, on the contrary, makes them unfit to be the foundations of all our\nother knowledge; as they are pretended to be. This cannot be denied,\nthat men grow first acquainted with many of these self-evident truths\nupon their being proposed: but it is clear that whosoever does so,\nfinds in himself that he then begins to know a proposition, which he\nknew not before, and which from thenceforth he never questions; not\nbecause it was innate, but because the consideration of the nature of\nthe things contained in those words would not suffer him to think\notherwise, how, or whensoever he is brought to reflect on them. And if\nwhatever is assented to at first hearing and understanding the terms\nmust pass for an innate principle, every well-grounded observation,\ndrawn from particulars into a general rule, must be innate. When yet it\nis certain that not all, but only sagacious heads, light at first on\nthese observations, and reduce them into general propositions: not\ninnate but collected from a preceding acquaintance and reflection on\nparticular instances. These, when observing men have made them,\nunobserving men, when they are proposed to them cannot refuse their\nassent to.\n22. Implicitly known before proposing, signifies that the Mind is\ncapable of understanding them, or else signifies nothing.\nIf it be said, the understanding hath an IMPLICIT knowledge of these\nprinciples, but not an EXPLICIT, before this first hearing (as they\nmust who will say \u201cthat they are in the understanding before they are\nknown,\u201d) it will be hard to conceive what is meant by a principle\nimprinted on the understanding implicitly, unless it be this,\u2014that the\nmind is capable of understanding and assenting firmly to such\npropositions. And thus all mathematical demonstrations, as well as\nfirst principles, must be received as native impressions on the mind;\nwhich I fear they will scarce allow them to be, who find it harder to\ndemonstrate a proposition than assent to it when demonstrated. And few\nmathematicians will be forward to believe, that all the diagrams they\nhave drawn were but copies of those innate characters which nature had\nengraven upon their minds.\n23. The Argument of assenting on first hearing, is upon a false\nsupposition of no precedent teaching.\nThere is, I fear, this further weakness in the foregoing argument,\nwhich would persuade us that therefore those maxims are to be thought\ninnate, which men admit at first hearing; because they assent to\npropositions which they are not taught, nor do receive from the force\nof any argument or demonstration, but a bare explication or\nunderstanding of the terms. Under which there seems to me to lie this\nfallacy, that men are supposed not to be taught nor to learn anything\n_de novo;_ when, in truth, they are taught, and do learn something they\nwere ignorant of before. For, first, it is evident that they have\nlearned the terms, and their signification; neither of which was born\nwith them. But this is not all the acquired knowledge in the case: the\nideas themselves, about which the proposition is, are not born with\nthem, no more than their names, but got afterwards. So that in all\npropositions that are assented to at first hearing, the terms of the\nproposition, their standing for such ideas, and the ideas themselves\nthat they stand for, being neither of them innate, I would fain know\nwhat there is remaining in such propositions that is innate. For I\nwould gladly have any one name that proposition whose terms or ideas\nwere either of them innate. We by degrees get ideas and names, and\nlearn their appropriated connexion one with another; and then to\npropositions made in such terms, whose signification we have learnt,\nand wherein the agreement or disagreement we can perceive in our ideas\nwhen put together is expressed, we at first hearing assent; though to\nother propositions, in themselves as certain and evident, but which are\nconcerning ideas not so soon or so easily got, we are at the same time\nno way capable of assenting. For, though a child quickly assents to\nthis proposition, \u201cThat an apple is not fire,\u201d when by familiar\nacquaintance he has got the ideas of those two different things\ndistinctly imprinted on his mind, and has learnt that the names apple\nand fire stand for them; yet it will be some years after, perhaps,\nbefore the same child will assent to this proposition, \u201cThat it is\nimpossible for the same thing to be and not to be\u201d; because that,\nthough perhaps the words are as easy to be learnt, yet the\nsignification of them being more large, comprehensive, and abstract\nthan of the names annexed to those sensible things the child hath to do\nwith, it is longer before he learns their precise meaning, and it\nrequires more time plainly to form in his mind those general ideas they\nstand for. Till that be done, you will in vain endeavour to make any\nchild assent to a proposition made up of such general terms; but as\nsoon as ever he has got those ideas, and learned their names, he\nforwardly closes with the one as well as the other of the forementioned\npropositions: and with both for the same reason; viz. because he finds\nthe ideas he has in his mind to agree or disagree, according as the\nwords standing for them are affirmed or denied one of another in the\nproposition. But if propositions be brought to him in words which stand\nfor ideas he has not yet in his mind, to such propositions, however\nevidently true or false in themselves, he affords neither assent nor\ndissent, but is ignorant. For words being but empty sounds, any further\nthan they are signs of our ideas, we cannot but assent to them as they\ncorrespond to those ideas we have, but no further than that. But the\nshowing by what steps and ways knowledge comes into our minds; and the\ngrounds of several degrees of assent, being; the business of the\nfollowing Discourse, it may suffice to have only touched on it here, as\none reason that made me doubt of those innate principles.\n24. Not innate because not universally assented to.\nTo conclude this argument of universal consent, I agree with these\ndefenders of innate principles,\u2014that if they are innate, they must\nneeds have universal assent. For that a truth should be innate and yet\nnot assented to, is to me as unintelligible as for a man to know a\ntruth and be ignorant of it at the same time. But then, by these men\u2019s\nown confession, they cannot be innate; since they are not assented to\nby those who understand not the terms; nor by a great part of those who\ndo understand them, but have yet never heard nor thought of those\npropositions; which, I think, is at least one half of mankind. But were\nthe number far less, it would be enough to destroy universal assent,\nand thereby show these propositions not to be innate, if children alone\nwere ignorant of them.\n25. These Maxims not the first known.\nBut that I may not be accused to argue from the thoughts of infants,\nwhich are unknown to us, and to conclude from what passes in their\nunderstandings before they express it; I say next, that these two\ngeneral propositions are not the truths that first possess the minds of\nchildren, nor are antecedent to all acquired and adventitious notions:\nwhich, if they were innate, they must needs be. Whether we can\ndetermine it or no, it matters not, there is certainly a time when\nchildren begin to think, and their words and actions do assure us that\nthey do so. When therefore they are capable of thought, of knowledge,\nof assent, can it rationally be supposed they can be ignorant of those\nnotions that nature has imprinted, were there any such? Can it be\nimagined, with any appearance of reason, that they perceive the\nimpressions from things without, and be at the same time ignorant of\nthose characters which nature itself has taken care to stamp within?\nCan they receive and assent to adventitious notions, and be ignorant of\nthose which are supposed woven into the very principles of their being,\nand imprinted there in indelible characters, to be the foundation and\nguide of all their acquired knowledge and future reasonings? This would\nbe to make nature take pains to no purpose; or at least to write very\nill; since its characters could not be read by those eyes which saw\nother things very well: and those are very ill supposed the clearest\nparts of truth, and the foundations of all our knowledge, which are not\nfirst known, and without which the undoubted knowledge of several other\nthings may be had. The child certainly knows, that the nurse that feeds\nit is neither the cat it plays with, nor the blackmoor it is afraid of:\nthat the wormseed or mustard it refuses, is not the apple or sugar it\ncries for: this it is certainly and undoubtedly assured of: but will\nany one say, it is by virtue of this principle, \u201cThat it is impossible\nfor the same thing to be and not to be,\u201d that it so firmly assents to\nthese and other parts of its knowledge? Or that the child has any\nnotion or apprehension of that proposition at an age, wherein yet, it\nis plain, it knows a great many other truths? He that will say,\nchildren join in these general abstract speculations with their\nsucking-bottles and their rattles, may perhaps, with justice, be\nthought to have more passion and zeal for his opinion, but less\nsincerity and truth, than one of that age.\n26. And so not innate.\nThough therefore there be several general propositions that meet with\nconstant and ready assent, as soon as proposed to men grown up, who\nhave attained the use of more general and abstract ideas, and names\nstanding for them; yet they not being to be found in those of tender\nyears, who nevertheless know other things, they cannot pretend to\nuniversal assent of intelligent persons, and so by no means can be\nsupposed innate;\u2014it being impossible that any truth which is innate (if\nthere were any such) should be unknown, at least to any one who knows\nanything else. Since, if they are innate truths, they must be innate\nthoughts: there being nothing a truth in the mind that it has never\nthought on. Whereby it is evident, if there be any innate truths, they\nmust necessarily be the first of any thought on; the first that appear.\n27. Not innate, because they appear least, where what is innate shows\nitself clearest.\nThat the general maxims we are discoursing of are not known to\nchildren, idiots, and a great part of mankind, we have already\nsufficiently proved: whereby it is evident they have not an universal\nassent, nor are general impressions. But there is this further argument\nin it against their being innate: that these characters, if they were\nnative and original impressions, should appear fairest and clearest in\nthose persons in whom yet we find no footsteps of them; and it is, in\nmy opinion, a strong presumption that they are not innate, since they\nare least known to those in whom, if they were innate, they must needs\nexert themselves with most force and vigour. For children, idiots,\nsavages, and illiterate people, being of all others the least corrupted\nby custom, or borrowed opinions; learning and education having not cast\ntheir native thoughts into new moulds; nor by superinducing foreign and\nstudied doctrines, confounded those fair characters nature had written\nthere; one might reasonably imagine that in THEIR minds these innate\nnotions should lie open fairly to every one\u2019s view, as it is certain\nthe thoughts of children do. It might very well be expected that these\nprinciples should be perfectly known to naturals; which being stamped\nimmediately on the soul, (as these men suppose,) can have no dependence\non the constitution or organs of the body, the only confessed\ndifference between them and others. One would think, according to these\nmen\u2019s principles, that all these native beams of light (were there any\nsuch) should, in those who have no reserves, no arts of concealment,\nshine out in their full lustre, and leave us in no more doubt of their\nbeing there, than we are of their love of pleasure and abhorrence of\npain. But alas, amongst children, idiots, savages, and the grossly\nilliterate, what general maxims are to be found? what universal\nprinciples of knowledge? Their notions are few and narrow, borrowed\nonly from those objects they have had most to do with, and which have\nmade upon their senses the frequentest and strongest impressions. A\nchild knows his nurse and his cradle, and by degrees the playthings of\na little more advanced age; and a young savage has, perhaps, his head\nfilled with love and hunting, according to the fashion of his tribe.\nBut he that from a child untaught, or a wild inhabitant of the woods,\nwill expect these abstract maxims and reputed principles of science,\nwill, I fear find himself mistaken. Such kind of general propositions\nare seldom mentioned in the huts of Indians: much less are they to be\nfound in the thoughts of children, or any impressions of them on the\nminds of naturals. They are the language and business of the schools\nand academies of learned nations accustomed to that sort of\nconversation or learning, where disputes are frequent; these maxims\nbeing suited to artificial argumentation and useful for conviction, but\nnot much conducing to the discovery of truth or advancement of\nknowledge. But of their small use for the improvement of knowledge I\nshall have occasion to speak more at large, l.4, c. 7.\n28. Recapitulation.\nI know not how absurd this may seem to the masters of demonstration.\nAnd probably it will hardly go down with anybody at first hearing. I\nmust therefore beg a little truce with prejudice, and the forbearance\nof censure, till I have been heard out in the sequel of this Discourse,\nbeing very willing to submit to better judgments. And since I\nimpartially search after truth, I shall not be sorry to be convinced,\nthat I have been too fond of my own notions; which I confess we are all\napt to be, when application and study have warmed our heads with them.\nUpon the whole matter, I cannot see any ground to think these two\nspeculative Maxims innate: since they are not universally assented to;\nand the assent they so generally find is no other than what several\npropositions, not allowed to be innate, equally partake in with them:\nand since the assent that is given them is produced another way, and\ncomes not from natural inscription, as I doubt not but to make appear\nin the following Discourse. And if THESE \u201cfirst principles\u201d of\nknowledge and science are found not to be innate, no OTHER speculative\nmaxims can (I suppose), with better right pretend to be so.\nCHAPTER III.\nNO INNATE PRACTICAL PRINCIPLES\n1. No moral Principles so clear and so generally received as the\nforementioned speculative Maxims.\nIf those speculative Maxims, whereof we discoursed in the foregoing\nchapter, have not an actual universal assent from all mankind, as we\nthere proved, it is much more visible concerning PRACTICAL Principles,\nthat they come short of an universal reception: and I think it will be\nhard to instance any one moral rule which can pretend to so general and\nready an assent as, \u201cWhat is, is\u201d; or to be so manifest a truth as\nthis, that \u201cIt is impossible for the same thing to be and not to be.\u201d\nWhereby it is evident that they are further removed from a title to be\ninnate; and the doubt of their being native impressions on the mind is\nstronger against those moral principles than the other. Not that it\nbrings their truth at all in question. They are equally true, though\nnot equally evident. Those speculative maxims carry their own evidence\nwith them: but moral principles require reasoning and discourse, and\nsome exercise of the mind, to discover the certainty of their truth.\nThey lie not open as natural characters engraved on the mind; which, if\nany such were, they must needs be visible by themselves, and by their\nown light be certain and known to everybody. But this is no derogation\nto their truth and certainty; no more than it is to the truth or\ncertainty of the three angles of a triangle being equal to two right\nones because it is not so evident as \u201cthe whole is bigger than a part,\u201d\nnor so apt to be assented to at first hearing. It may suffice that\nthese moral rules are capable of demonstration: and therefore it is our\nown faults if we come not to a certain knowledge of them. But the\nignorance wherein many men are of them, and the slowness of assent\nwherewith others receive them, are manifest proofs that they are not\ninnate, and such as offer themselves to their view without searching.\n2. Faith and Justice not owned as Principles by all Men.\nWhether there be any such moral principles, wherein all men do agree, I\nappeal to any who have been but moderately conversant in the history of\nmankind, and looked abroad beyond the smoke of their own chimneys.\nWhere is that practical truth that is universally received, without\ndoubt or question, as it must be if innate? JUSTICE, and keeping of\ncontracts, is that which most men seem to agree in. This is a principle\nwhich is thought to extend itself to the dens of thieves, and the\nconfederacies of the greatest villains; and they who have gone furthest\ntowards the putting off of humanity itself, keep faith and rules of\njustice one with another. I grant that outlaws themselves do this one\namongst another: but it is without receiving these as the innate laws\nof nature. They practise them as rules of convenience within their own\ncommunities: but it is impossible to conceive that he embraces justice\nas a practical principle who acts fairly with his fellow-highwayman,\nand at the same time plunders or kills the next honest man he meets\nwith. Justice and truth are the common ties of society; and therefore\neven outlaws and robbers, who break with all the world besides, must\nkeep faith and rules of equity amongst themselves; or else they cannot\nhold together. But will any one say, that those that live by fraud or\nrapine have innate principles of truth and justice which they allow and\nassent to?\n3. Objection: though Men deny them in their Practice, yet they admit\nthem in their Thoughts answered.\nPerhaps it will be urged, that the tacit assent of their minds agrees\nto what their practice contradicts. I answer, first, I have always\nthought the actions of men the best interpreters of their thoughts.\nBut, since it is certain that most men\u2019s practices, and some men\u2019s open\nprofessions, have either questioned or denied these principles, it is\nimpossible to establish an universal consent, (though we should look\nfor it only amongst grown men,) without which it is impossible to\nconclude them innate. Secondly, it is very strange and unreasonable to\nsuppose innate practical principles, that terminate only in\ncontemplation. Practical principles, derived from nature, are there for\noperation, and must produce conformity of action, not barely\nspeculative assent to their truth, or else they are in vain\ndistinguished from speculative maxims. Nature, I confess, has put into\nman a desire of happiness and an aversion to misery: these indeed are\ninnate practical principles which (as practical principles ought) DO\ncontinue constantly to operate and influence all our actions without\nceasing: these may be observed in all persons and all ages, steady and\nuniversal; but these are INCLINATIONS OF THE APPETITE to good, not\nimpressions of truth on the understanding. I deny not that there are\nnatural tendencies imprinted on the minds of men; and that from the\nvery first instances of sense and perception, there are some things\nthat are grateful and others unwelcome to them; some things that they\nincline to and others that they fly: but this makes nothing for innate\ncharacters on the mind, which are to be the principles of knowledge\nregulating our practice. Such natural impressions on the understanding\nare so far from being confirmed hereby, that this is an argument\nagainst them; since, if there were certain characters imprinted by\nnature on the understanding, as the principles of knowledge, we could\nnot but perceive them constantly operate in us and influence our\nknowledge, as we do those others on the will and appetite; which never\ncease to be the constant springs and motives of all our actions, to\nwhich we perpetually feel them strongly impelling us.\n4. Moral Rules need a Proof, _ergo_ not innate.\nAnother reason that makes me doubt of any innate practical principles\nis, that I think _there cannot any one moral Rule be propos\u2019d whereof a\nMan may not justly demand a Reason:_ which would be perfectly\nridiculous and absurd if they were innate; or so much as self-evident,\nwhich every innate principle must needs be, and not need any proof to\nascertain its truth, nor want any reason to gain it approbation. He\nwould be thought void of common sense who asked on the one side, or on\nthe other side went to give a reason WHY \u201cit is impossible for the same\nthing to be and not to be.\u201d It carries its own light and evidence with\nit, and needs no other proof: he that understands the terms assents to\nit for its own sake or else nothing will ever be able to prevail with\nhim to do it. But should that most unshaken rule of morality and\nfoundation of all social virtue, \u201cThat one should do as he would be\ndone unto,\u201d be proposed to one who never heard of it before, but yet is\nof capacity to understand its meaning; might he not without any\nabsurdity ask a reason why? And were not he that proposed it bound to\nmake out the truth and reasonableness of it to him? Which plainly shows\nit not to be innate; for if it were it could neither want nor receive\nany proof; but must needs (at least as soon as heard and understood) be\nreceived and assented to as an unquestionable truth, which a man can by\nno means doubt of. So that the truth of all these moral rules plainly\ndepends upon some other antecedent to them, and from which they must be\ndeduced; which could not be if either they were innate or so much as\nself-evident.\n5. Instance in keeping Compacts\nThat men should keep their compacts is certainly a great and undeniable\nrule in morality. But yet, if a Christian, who has the view of\nhappiness and misery in another life, be asked why a man must keep his\nword, he will give this as a reason:\u2014Because God, who has the power of\neternal life and death, requires it of us. But if a Hobbist be asked\nwhy? he will answer:\u2014Because the public requires it, and the Leviathan\nwill punish you if you do not. And if one of the old philosophers had\nbeen asked, he would have answered:\u2014Because it was dishonest, below the\ndignity of a man, and opposite to virtue, the highest perfection of\nhuman nature, to do otherwise.\n6. Virtue generally approved not because innate, but because\nprofitable.\nHence naturally flows the great variety of opinions concerning moral\nrules which are to be found among men, according to the different sorts\nof happiness they have a prospect of, or propose to themselves; which\ncould not be if practical principles were innate, and imprinted in our\nminds immediately by the hand of God. I grant the existence of God is\nso many ways manifest, and the obedience we owe him so congruous to the\nlight of reason, that a great part of mankind give testimony to the law\nof nature: but yet I think it must be allowed that several moral rules\nmay receive from mankind a very general approbation, without either\nknowing or admitting the true ground of morality; which can only be the\nwill and law of a God, who sees men in the dark, has in his hand\nrewards and punishments, and power enough to call to account the\nproudest offender. For, God having, by an inseparable connexion, joined\nvirtue and public happiness together, and made the practice thereof\nnecessary to the preservation of society, and visibly beneficial to all\nwith whom the virtuous man has to do; it is no wonder that every one\nshould not only allow, but recommend and magnify those rules to others,\nfrom whose observance of them he is sure to reap advantage to himself.\nHe may, out of interest as well as conviction, cry up that for sacred,\nwhich, if once trampled on and profaned, he himself cannot be safe nor\nsecure. This, though it takes nothing from the moral and eternal\nobligation which these rules evidently have, yet it shows that the\noutward acknowledgment men pay to them in their words proves not that\nthey are innate principles: nay, it proves not so much as that men\nassent to them inwardly in their own minds, as the inviolable rules of\ntheir own practice; since we find that self-interest, and the\nconveniences of this life, make many men own an outward profession and\napprobation of them, whose actions sufficiently prove that they very\nlittle consider the Lawgiver that prescribed these rules; nor the hell\nthat he has ordained for the punishment of those that transgress them.\n7. Men\u2019s actions convince us, that the Rule of Virtue is not their\ninternal Principle.\nFor, if we will not in civility allow too much sincerity to the\nprofessions of most men, but think their actions to be the interpreters\nof their thoughts, we shall find that they have no such internal\nveneration for these rules, nor so full a persuasion of their certainty\nand obligation. The great principle of morality, \u2018To do as one would be\ndone to,\u2019 is more commended than practised. But the breach of this rule\ncannot be a greater vice, than to teach others, that it is no moral\nrule, nor obligatory, would be thought madness, and contrary to that\ninterest men sacrifice to, when they break it themselves. Perhaps\nCONSCIENCE will be urged as checking us for such breaches, and so the\ninternal obligation and establishment of the rule be preserved.\n8. Conscience no Proof of any innate Moral Rule.\nTo which I answer, that I doubt not but, without being written on their\nhearts, many men may, by the same way that they come to the knowledge\nof other things, come to assent to several moral rules, and be\nconvinced of their obligation. Others also may come to be of the same\nmind, from their education, company, and customs of their country;\nwhich persuasion, however got, will serve to set conscience on work;\nwhich is nothing else but our own opinion or judgment of the moral\nrectitude or gravity of our own actions; and if conscience be a proof\nof innate principles, contraries may be innate principles; since some\nmen with the same bent of conscience prosecute what others avoid.\n9. Instances of Enormities practised without Remorse.\nBut I cannot see how any men should ever transgress those moral rules,\nwith confidence and serenity, were they innate, and stamped upon their\nminds. View but an army at the sacking of a town, and see what\nobservation or sense of moral principles, or what touch of conscience\nfor all the outrages they do. Robberies, murders, rapes, are the sports\nof men set at liberty from punishment and censure. Have there not been\nwhole nations, and those of the most civilized people, amongst whom the\nexposing their children, and leaving them in the fields to perish by\nwant or wild beasts has been the practice; as little condemned or\nscrupled as the begetting them? Do they not still, in some countries,\nput them into the same graves with their mothers, if they die in\nchildbirth; or despatch them, if a pretended astrologer declares them\nto have unhappy stars? And are there not places where, at a certain\nage, they kill or expose their parents, without any remorse at all? In\na part of Asia, the sick, when their case comes to be thought\ndesperate, are carried out and laid on the earth before they are dead;\nand left there, exposed to wind and weather, to perish without\nassistance or pity. It is familiar among the Mingrelians, a people\nprofessing Christianity, to bury their children alive without scruple.\nThere are places where they eat their own children. The Caribbees were\nwont to geld their children, on purpose to fat and eat them. And\nGarcilasso de la Vega tells us of a people in Peru which were wont to\nfat and eat the children they got on their female captives, whom they\nkept as concubines for that purpose, and when they were past breeding,\nthe mothers themselves were killed too and eaten. The virtues whereby\nthe Tououpinambos believed they merited paradise, were revenge, and\neating abundance of their enemies. They have not so much as a name for\nGod, and have no religion, no worship. The saints who are canonized\namongst the Turks, lead lives which one cannot with modesty relate. A\nremarkable passage to this purpose, out of the voyage of Baumgarten,\nwhich is a book not every day to be met with, I shall set down at\nlarge, in the language it is published in.\nIbi (sc. prope Belbes in Aegypto) vidimus sanctum unum Saracenicum\ninter arenarum cumulos, ita ut ex utero matris prodiit nudum sedentem.\nMos est, ut didicimus, Mahometistis, ut eos, qui amentes et sine\nratione sunt, pro sanctis colant et venerentur. Insuper et eos, qui cum\ndiu vitam egerint inquinatissimam, voluntariam demum poenitentiam et\npaupertatem, sanctitate venerandos deputant. Ejusmodi vero genus\nhominum libertatem quandam effrenem habent, domos quos volunt intrandi,\nedendi, bibendi, et quod majus est, concumbendi; ex quo concubitu, si\nproles secuta fuerit, sancta similiter habetur. His ergo hominibus dum\nvivunt, magnos exhibent honores; mortuis vero vel templa vel monumenta\nextruunt amplissima, eosque contingere ac sepelire maximae fortunae\nducunt loco. Audivimus haec dicta et dicenda per interpretem a Mucrelo\nnostro. Insuper sanctum ilium, quern eo loco vidimus, publicitus\napprime commendari, eum esse hominem sanctum, divinum ac integritate\npraecipuum; eo quod, nec faminarum unquam esset, nec puerorum, sed\ntantummodo asellarum concubitor atque mularum. (Peregr. Baumgarten, 1.\nii. c. i. p. 73.)\nWhere then are those innate principles of justice, piety, gratitude,\nequity, chastity? Or where is that universal consent that assures us\nthere are such inbred rules? Murders in duels, when fashion has made\nthem honourable, are committed without remorse of conscience: nay, in\nmany places innocence in this case is the greatest ignominy. And if we\nlook abroad to take a view of men as they are, we shall find that they\nhave remorse, in one place, for doing or omitting that which others, in\nanother place, think they merit by.\n10. Men have contrary practical Principles.\nHe that will carefully peruse the history of mankind, and look abroad\ninto the several tribes of men, and with indifferency survey their\nactions, will be able to satisfy himself, that there is scarce that\nprinciple of morality to be named, or, rule of virtue to be thought on,\n(those only excepted that are absolutely necessary to hold society\ntogether, which commonly too are neglected betwixt distinct societies,)\nwhich is not, somewhere or other, slighted and condemned by the general\nfashion of whole societies of men, governed by practical opinions and\nrules of living quite opposite to others.\n11. Whole Nations reject several Moral Rules.\nHere perhaps it will be objected, that it is no argument that the rule\nis not known, because it is broken. I grant the objection good where\nmen, though they transgress, yet disown not the law; where fear of\nshame, censure, or punishment, carries the mark of some awe it has upon\nthem. But it is impossible to conceive that a whole nation of men\nshould all publicly reject and renounce what every one of them\ncertainly and infallibly knew to be a law; for so they must who have it\nnaturally imprinted on their minds. It is possible men may sometimes\nown rules of morality which in their private thoughts they do not\nbelieve to be true, only to keep themselves in reputation and esteem\namongst those who are persuaded of their obligation. But it is not to\nbe imagined that a whole society of men should publicly and professedly\ndisown and cast off a rule which they could not in their own minds but\nbe infallibly certain was a law; nor be ignorant that all men they\nshould have to do with knew it to be such: and therefore must every one\nof them apprehend from others all the contempt and abhorrence due to\none who professes himself void of humanity: and one who, confounding\nthe known and natural measures of right and wrong, cannot but be looked\non as the professed enemy of their peace and happiness. Whatever\npractical principle is innate, cannot but be known to every one to be\njust and good. It is therefore little less than a contradiction to\nsuppose, that whole nations of men should, both in their professions\nand practice, unanimously and universally give the lie to what, by the\nmost invincible evidence, every one of them knew to be true, right, and\ngood. This is enough to satisfy us that no practical rule which is\nanywhere universally, and with public approbation or allowance,\ntransgressed, can be supposed innate.\u2014But I have something further to\nadd in answer to this objection.\n12. The generally allowed breach of a rule proof that it is not innate.\nThe breaking of a rule, say you, is no argument that it is unknown. I\ngrant it: but the GENERALLY ALLOWED breach of it anywhere, I say, is a\nproof that it is not innate. For example: let us take any of these\nrules, which, being the most obvious deductions of human reason, and\nconformable to the natural inclination of the greatest part of men,\nfewest people have had the impudence to deny or inconsideration to\ndoubt of. If any can be thought to be naturally imprinted, none, I\nthink, can have a fairer pretence to be innate than this: \u201cParents,\npreserve and cherish your children.\u201d When, therefore, you say that this\nis an innate rule, what do you mean? Either that it is an innate\nprinciple which upon all occasions excites and directs the actions of\nall men; or else, that it is a truth which all men have imprinted on\ntheir minds, and which therefore they know and assent to. But in\nneither of these senses is it innate. FIRST, that it is not a principle\nwhich influences all men\u2019s actions, is what I have proved by the\nexamples before cited: nor need we seek so far as the Mingrelia or Peru\nto find instances of such as neglect, abuse, nay, and destroy their\nchildren; or look on it only as the more than brutality of some savage\nand barbarous nations, when we remember that it was a familiar and\nuncondemned practice amongst the Greeks and Romans to expose, without\npity or remorse, their innocent infants. SECONDLY, that it is an innate\ntruth, known to all men, is also false. For, \u201cParents preserve your\nchildren,\u201d is so far from an innate truth, that it is no truth at all:\nit being a command, and not a proposition, and so not capable of truth\nor falsehood. To make it capable of being assented to as true, it must\nbe reduced to some such proposition as this: \u201cIt is the duty of parents\nto preserve their children.\u201d But what duty is, cannot be understood\nwithout a law; nor a law be known or supposed without a lawmaker, or\nwithout reward and punishment; so that it is impossible that this, or\nany other, practical principle should be innate, i.e. be imprinted on\nthe mind as a duty, without supposing the ideas of God, of law, of\nobligation, of punishment, of a life after this, innate: for that\npunishment follows not in this life the breach of this rule, and\nconsequently that it has not the force of a law in countries where the\ngenerally allowed practice runs counter to it, is in itself evident.\nBut these ideas (which must be all of them innate, if anything as a\nduty be so) are so far from being innate, that it is not every studious\nor thinking man, much less every one that is born, in whom they are to\nbe found clear and distinct; and that one of them, which of all others\nseems most likely to be innate, is not so, (I mean the idea of God,) I\nthink, in the next chapter, will appear very evident to any considering\nman.\n13. If men can be ignorant of what is innate, certainty is not\ndescribed by innate principles.\nFrom what has been said, I think we may safely conclude that whatever\npractical rule is in any place generally and with allowance broken,\ncannot be supposed innate; it being impossible that men should, without\nshame or fear, confidently and serenely, break a rule which they could\nnot but evidently know that God had set up, and would certainly punish\nthe breach of, (which they must, if it were innate,) to a degree to\nmake it a very ill bargain to the transgressor. Without such a\nknowledge as this, a man can never be certain that anything is his\nduty. Ignorance or doubt of the law, hopes to escape the knowledge or\npower of the law-maker, or the like, may make men give way to a present\nappetite; but let any one see the fault, and the rod by it, and with\nthe transgression, a fire ready to punish it; a pleasure tempting, and\nthe hand of the Almighty visibly held up and prepared to take\nvengeance, (for this must be the case where any duty is imprinted on\nthe mind,) and then tell me whether it be possible for people with such\na prospect, such a certain knowledge as this, wantonly, and without\nscruple, to offend against a law which they carry about them in\nindelible characters, and that stares them in the face whilst they are\nbreaking it? Whether men, at the same time that they feel in themselves\nthe imprinted edicts of an Omnipotent Law-maker, can, with assurance\nand gaiety, slight and trample underfoot his most sacred injunctions?\nAnd lastly, whether it be possible that whilst a man thus openly bids\ndefiance to this innate law and supreme Lawgiver, all the bystanders,\nyea, even the governors and rulers of the people, full of the same\nsense both of the law and Law-maker, should silently connive, without\ntestifying their dislike or laying the least blame on it? Principles of\nactions indeed there are lodged in men\u2019s appetites; but these are so\nfar from being innate moral principles, that if they were left to their\nfull swing they would carry men to the overturning of all morality.\nMoral laws are set as a curb and restraint to these exorbitant desires,\nwhich they cannot be but by rewards and punishments that will\noverbalance the satisfaction any one shall propose to himself in the\nbreach of the law. If, therefore, anything be imprinted on the minds of\nall men as a law, all men must have a certain and unavoidable knowledge\nthat certain and unavoidable punishment will attend the breach of it.\nFor if men can be ignorant or doubtful of what is innate, innate\nprinciples are insisted on, and urged to no purpose; truth and\ncertainty (the things pretended) are not at all secured by them; but\nmen are in the same uncertain floating estate with as without them. An\nevident indubitable knowledge of unavoidable punishment, great enough\nto make the transgression very uneligible, must accompany an innate\nlaw; unless with an innate law they can suppose an innate Gospel too. I\nwould not here be mistaken, as if, because I deny an innate law I\nthought there were none but positive laws. There is a great deal of\ndifference between an innate law, and a law of nature between something\nimprinted on our minds in their very original, and something that we,\nbeing ignorant of, may attain to the knowledge of, by the use and due\napplication of our natural faculties. And I think they equally forsake\nthe truth who, running into contrary extremes, either affirm an innate\nlaw, or deny that there is a law knowable by the light of nature, i.e.\nwithout the help of positive revelation.\n14. Those who maintain innate practical Principles tell us not what\nthey are.\nThe difference there is amongst men in their practical principles is so\nevident that I think I need say no more to evince, that it will be\nimpossible to find any innate moral rules by this mark of general\nassent; and it is enough to make one suspect that the supposition of\nsuch innate principles is but an opinion taken up at pleasure; since\nthose who talk so confidently of them are so sparing to tell us WHICH\nTHEY ARE. This might with justice be expected from those men who lay\nstress upon this opinion; and it gives occasion to distrust either\ntheir knowledge or charity, who, declaring that God has imprinted on\nthe minds of men the foundations of knowledge and the rules of living,\nare yet so little favourable to the information of their neighbours, or\nthe quiet of mankind, as not to point out to them which they are, in\nthe variety men are distracted with. But, in truth, were there any such\ninnate principles there would be no need to teach them. Did men find\nsuch innate propositions stamped on their minds, they would easily be\nable to distinguish them from other truths that they afterwards learned\nand deduced from them; and there would be nothing more easy than to\nknow what, and how many, they were. There could be no more doubt about\ntheir number than there is about the number of our fingers; and it is\nlike then every system would be ready to give them us by tale. But\nsince nobody, that I know, has ventured yet to give a catalogue of\nthem, they cannot blame those who doubt of these innate principles;\nsince even they who require men to believe that there are such innate\npropositions, do not tell us what they are. It is easy to foresee, that\nif different men of different sects should go about to give us a list\nof those innate practical principles, they would set down only such as\nsuited their distinct hypotheses, and were fit to support the doctrines\nof their particular schools or churches; a plain evidence that there\nare no such innate truths. Nay, a great part of men are so far from\nfinding any such innate moral principles in themselves, that, by\ndenying freedom to mankind, and thereby making men no other than bare\nmachines, they take away not only innate, but all moral rules\nwhatsoever, and leave not a possibility to believe any such, to those\nwho cannot conceive how anything can be capable of a law that is not a\nfree agent. And upon that ground they must necessarily reject all\nprinciples of virtue, who cannot put MORALITY and MECHANISM together,\nwhich are not very easy to be reconciled or made consistent.\n15. Lord Herbert\u2019s innate Principles examined.\nWhen I had written this, being informed that my Lord Herbert had, in\nhis book De Veritate, assigned these innate principles, I presently\nconsulted him, hoping to find in a man of so great parts, something\nthat might satisfy me in this point, and put an end to my inquiry. In\nhis chapter De Instinctu Naturali, I met with these six marks of his\nNotitice Communes:\u20141. Prioritas. 2. Independentia. 3. Universalitas. 4.\nCertitudo. 5. Necessitas, i. e. as he explains it, faciunt ad hominis\nconservationem. 6. Modus conformationis, i.e. Assensus nulla\ninterposita mora. And at the latter end of his little treatise De\nReligione Laici, he says this of these innate principles: Adeo ut non\nuniuscujusvis religionis confinio arctentur quae ubique vigent\nveritates. Sunt enim in ipsa mente caelitus descriptae, nullisque\ntraditionibus, sive scriptis, sive non scriptis, obnoxiae, p.3 And\nVeritates nostrae catholicae, quae tanquam indubia Dei emata in foro\ninteriori descriptae.\nThus, having given the marks of the innate principles or common\nnotions, and asserted their being imprinted on the minds of men by the\nhand of God, he proceeds to set them down, and they are these:\u20141. Esse\naliquod supremum numen. 2. Numen illud coli debere. 3. Virtutem cum\npietate conjunctam optimum esse rationem cultus divini. 4.\nResipiscendum esse a peccatis. 5. Dari praemium vel paenam post hanc\nvitam transactam. Though I allow these to be clear truths, and such as,\nif rightly explained, a rational creature can hardly avoid giving his\nassent to, yet I think he is far from proving them innate impressions\nin foro interiori descriptae. For I must take leave to observe:\u2014\n16. These five either not all, or more than all, if there are any.\nFirst, that these five propositions are either not all, or more than\nall, those common notions written on our minds by the finger of God; if\nit were reasonable to believe any at all to be so written. Since there\nare other propositions which, even by his own rules, have as just a\npretence to such an original, and may be as well admitted for innate\nprinciples, as at least some of these five he enumerates, viz. \u2018Do as\nthou wouldst be done unto.\u2019 And perhaps some hundreds of others, when\nwell considered.\n17. The supposed marks wanting.\nSecondly, that all his marks are not to be found in each of his five\npropositions, viz. his first, second, and third marks agree perfectly\nto neither of them; and the first, second, third, fourth, and sixth\nmarks agree but ill to his third, fourth, and fifth propositions. For,\nbesides that we are assured from history of many men, nay whole\nnations, who doubt or disbelieve some or all of them, I cannot see how\nthe third, viz. \u201cThat virtue joined with piety is the best worship of\nGod,\u201d can be an innate principle, when the name or sound virtue, is so\nhard to be understood; liable to so much uncertainty in its\nsignification; and the thing it stands for so much contended about and\ndifficult to be known. And therefore this cannot be but a very\nuncertain rule of human practice, and serve but very little to the\nconduct of our lives, and is therefore very unfit to be assigned as an\ninnate practical principle.\n18. Of little use if they were innate.\nFor let us consider this proposition as to its meaning, (for it is the\nsense, and not sound, that is and must be the principle or common\nnotion,) viz. \u201cVirtue is the best worship of God,\u201d i.e. is most\nacceptable to him; which, if virtue be taken, as most commonly it is,\nfor those actions which, according to the different opinions of several\ncountries, are accounted laudable, will be a proposition so far from\nbeing certain, that it will not be true. If virtue be taken for actions\nconformable to God\u2019s will, or to the rule prescribed by God\u2014which is\nthe true and only measure of virtue when virtue is used to signify what\nis in its own nature right and good\u2014then this proposition, \u201cThat virtue\nis the best worship of God,\u201d will be most true and certain, but of very\nlittle use in human life: since it will amount to no more but this,\nviz. \u201cThat God is pleased with the doing of what he commands\u201d;\u2014which a\nman may certainly know to be true, without knowing what it is that God\ndoth command; and so be as far from any rule or principle of his\nactions as he was before. And I think very few will take a proposition\nwhich amounts to no more than this, viz. \u201cThat God is pleased with the\ndoing of what he himself commands,\u201d for an innate moral principle\nwritten on the minds of all men, (however true and certain it may be,)\nsince it teaches so little. Whosoever does so will have reason to think\nhundreds of propositions innate principles; since there are many which\nhave as good a title as this to be received for such, which nobody yet\never put into that rank of innate principles.\n19. Scarce possible that God should engrave principles in words of\nuncertain meaning.\nNor is the fourth proposition (viz. \u201cMen must repent of their sins\u201d)\nmuch more instructive, till what those actions are that are meant by\nsins be set down. For the word peccata, or sins, being put, as it\nusually is, to signify in general ill actions that will draw punishment\nupon the doers, what great principle of morality can that be to tell us\nwe should be sorry, and cease to do that which will bring mischief upon\nus; without knowing what those particular actions are that will do so?\nIndeed this is a very true proposition, and fit to be inculcated on and\nreceived by those who are supposed to have been taught WHAT actions in\nall kinds ARE sins: but neither this nor the former can be imagined to\nbe innate principles; nor to be of any use if they were innate, unless\nthe particular measures and bounds of all virtues and vices were\nengraven in men\u2019s minds, and were innate principles also, which I think\nis very much to be doubted. And therefore, I imagine, it will scarcely\nseem possible that God should engrave principles in men\u2019s minds, in\nwords of uncertain signification, such as VIRTUES and SINS, which\namongst different men stand for different things: nay, it cannot be\nsupposed to be in words at all, which, being in most of these\nprinciples very general names, cannot be understood but by knowing the\nparticulars comprehended under them. And in the practical instances,\nthe measures must be taken from the knowledge of the actions\nthemselves, and the rules of them,\u2014abstracted from words, and\nantecedent to the knowledge of names; which rules a man must know, what\nlanguage soever he chance to learn, whether English or Japan, or if he\nshould learn no language at all, or never should understand the use of\nwords, as happens in the case of dumb and deaf men. When it shall be\nmade out that men ignorant of words, or untaught by the laws and\ncustoms of their country, know that it is part of the worship of God\nnot to kill another man; not to know more women than one; not to\nprocure abortion; not to expose their children; not to take from\nanother what is his, though we want it ourselves, but on the contrary,\nrelieve and supply his wants; and whenever we have done the contrary we\nought to repent, be sorry, and resolve to do so no more;\u2014when I say,\nall men shall be proved actually to know and allow all these and a\nthousand other such rules, all of which come under these two general\nwords made use of above, viz. virtutes et peccata virtues and sins,\nthere will be more reason for admitting these and the like, for common\nnotions and practical principles. Yet, after all, universal consent\n(were there any in moral principles) to truths, the knowledge whereof\nmay be attained otherwise, would scarce prove them to be innate; which\nis all I contend for.\n20. Objection, Innate Principles may be corrupted, answered.\nNor will it be of much moment here to offer that very ready but not\nvery material answer, viz. that the innate principles of morality may,\nby education, and custom, and the general opinion of those amongst whom\nwe converse, be darkened, and at last quite worn out of the minds of\nmen. Which assertion of theirs, if true, quite takes away the argument\nof universal consent, by which this opinion of innate principles is\nendeavoured to be proved; unless those men will think it reasonable\nthat their private persuasions, or that of their party, should pass for\nuniversal consent;\u2014a thing not unfrequently done, when men, presuming\nthemselves to be the only masters of right reason, cast by the votes\nand opinions of the rest of mankind as not worthy the reckoning. And\nthen their argument stands thus:\u2014\u201cThe principles which all mankind\nallow for true, are innate; those that men of right reason admit, are\nthe principles allowed by all mankind; we, and those of our mind, are\nmen of reason; therefore, we agreeing, our principles are\ninnate\u201d;\u2014which is a very pretty way of arguing, and a short cut to\ninfallibility. For otherwise it will be very hard to understand how\nthere be some principles which all men do acknowledge and agree in; and\nyet there are none of those principles which are not, by depraved\ncustom and ill education, blotted out of the minds of many men: which\nis to say, that all men admit, but yet many men do deny and dissent\nfrom them. And indeed the supposition of SUCH first principles will\nserve us to very little purpose; and we shall be as much at a loss with\nas without them, if they may, by any human power\u2014such as the will of\nour teachers, or opinions of our companions\u2014be altered or lost in us:\nand notwithstanding all this boast of first principles and innate\nlight, we shall be as much in the dark and uncertainty as if there were\nno such thing at all: it being all one to have no rule, and one that\nwill warp any way; or amongst various and contrary rules, not to know\nwhich is the right. But concerning innate principles, I desire these\nmen to say, whether they can or cannot, by education and custom, be\nblurred and blotted out; if they cannot, we must find them in all\nmankind alike, and they must be clear in everybody; and if they may\nsuffer variation from adventitious notions, we must then find them\nclearest and most perspicuous nearest the fountain, in children and\nilliterate people, who have received least impression from foreign\nopinions. Let them take which side they please, they will certainly\nfind it inconsistent with visible matter of fact and daily observation.\n21. Contrary Principles in the World.\nI easily grant that there are great numbers of opinions which, by men\nof different countries, educations, and tempers, are received and\nembraced as first and unquestionable principles; many whereof, both for\ntheir absurdity as well as oppositions to one another, it is impossible\nshould be true. But yet all those propositions, how remote soever from\nreason are so sacred somewhere or other, that men even of good\nunderstanding in other matters, will sooner part with their lives, and\nwhatever is dearest to them, than suffer themselves to doubt, or others\nto question, the truth of them.\n22. How men commonly come by their Principles.\nThis, however strange it may seem, is that which every day\u2019s experience\nconfirms; and will not, perhaps, appear so wonderful, if we consider\nthe ways and steps by which it is brought about; and how really it may\ncome to pass, that doctrines that have been derived from no better\noriginal than the superstition of a nurse, or the authority of an old\nwoman, may, by length of time and consent of neighbours, grow up to the\ndignity of PRINCIPLES in religion or morality. For such, who are\ncareful (as they call it) to principle children well, (and few there be\nwho have not a set of those principles for them, which they believe\nin,) instil into the unwary, and as yet unprejudiced, understanding,\n(for white paper receives any characters,) those doctrines they would\nhave them retain and profess. These being taught them as soon as they\nhave any apprehension; and still as they grow up confirmed to them,\neither by the open profession or tacit consent of all they have to do\nwith; or at least by those of whose wisdom, knowledge, and piety they\nhave an opinion, who never suffer those propositions to be otherwise\nmentioned but as the basis and foundation on which they build their\nreligion and manners, come, by these means, to have the reputation of\nunquestionable, self-evident, and innate truths.\n23. Principles supposed innate because we do not remember when we began\nto hold them.\nTo which we may add, that when men so instructed are grown up, and\nreflect on their own minds, they cannot find anything more ancient\nthere than those opinions, which were taught them before their memory\nbegan to keep a register of their actions, or date the time when any\nnew thing appeared to them; and therefore make no scruple to conclude,\nthat those propositions of whose knowledge they can find in themselves\nno original, were certainly the impress of God and nature upon their\nminds, and not taught them by any one else. These they entertain and\nsubmit to, as many do to their parents with veneration; not because it\nis natural: nor do children do it where they are not so taught; but\nbecause, having been always so educated, and having no remembrance of\nthe beginning of this respect, they think it is natural.\n24. How such principles come to be held.\nThis will appear very likely, and almost unavoidable to come to pass,\nif we consider the nature of mankind and the constitution of human\naffairs; wherein most men cannot live without employing their time in\nthe daily labours of their callings; nor be at quiet in their minds\nwithout SOME foundation or principle to rest their thoughts on. There\nis scarcely any one so floating and superficial in his understanding,\nwho hath not some reverenced propositions, which are to him the\nprinciples on which he bottoms his reasonings, and by which he judgeth\nof truth and falsehood, right and wrong; which some, wanting skill and\nleisure, and others the inclination, and some being taught that they\nought not to examine, there are few to be found who are not exposed by\ntheir ignorance, laziness, education, or precipitancy, to TAKE THEM\nUPON TRUST.\n25. Further explained.\nThis is evidently the case of all children and young folk; and custom,\na greater power than nature, seldom failing to make them worship for\ndivine what she hath inured them to bow their minds and submit their\nunderstandings to, it is no wonder that grown men, either perplexed in\nthe necessary affairs of life, or hot in the pursuit of pleasures,\nshould not seriously sit down to examine their own tenets; especially\nwhen one of their principles is, that principles ought not to be\nquestioned. And had men leisure, parts, and will, who is there almost\nthat dare shake the foundations of all his past thoughts and actions,\nand endure to bring upon himself the shame of having been a long time\nwholly in mistake and error? Who is there hardy enough to contend with\nthe reproach which is everywhere prepared for those who dare venture to\ndissent from the received opinions of their country or party? And where\nis the man to be found that can patiently prepare himself to bear the\nname of whimsical, sceptical, or atheist; which he is sure to meet\nwith, who does in the least scruple any of the common opinions? And he\nwill be much more afraid to question those principles, when he shall\nthink them, as most men do, the standards set up by God in his mind, to\nbe the rule and touchstone of all other opinions. And what can hinder\nhim from thinking them sacred, when he finds them the earliest of all\nhis own thoughts, and the most reverenced by others?\n26. A worship of idols.\nIt is easy to imagine how, by these means, it comes to pass that men\nworship the idols that have been set up in their minds; grow fond of\nthe notions they have been long acquainted with there; and stamp the\ncharacters of divinity upon absurdities and errors; become zealous\nvotaries to bulls and monkeys, and contend too, fight, and die in\ndefence of their opinions. _Dum solos credit habendos esse deos, quos\nipse colit_. For, since the reasoning faculties of the soul, which are\nalmost constantly, though not always warily nor wisely employed, would\nnot know how to move, for want of a foundation and footing, in most\nmen, who through laziness or avocation do not, or for want of time, or\ntrue helps, or for other causes, cannot penetrate into the principles\nof knowledge, and trace truth to its fountain and original, it is\nnatural for them, and almost unavoidable, to take up with some borrowed\nprinciples; which being reputed and presumed to be the evident proofs\nof other things, are thought not to need any other proof themselves.\nWhoever shall receive any of these into his mind, and entertain them\nthere with the reverence usually paid to principles, never venturing to\nexamine them, but accustoming himself to believe them, because they are\nto be believed, may take up, from his education and the fashions of his\ncountry, any absurdity for innate principles; and by long poring on the\nsame objects, so dim his sight as to take monsters lodged in his own\nbrain for the images of the Deity, and the workmanship of his hands.\n27. Principles must be examined.\nBy this progress, how many there are who arrive at principles which\nthey believe innate may be easily observed, in the variety of opposite\nprinciples held and contended for by all sorts and degrees of men. And\nhe that shall deny this to be the method wherein most men proceed to\nthe assurance they have of the truth and evidence of their principles,\nwill perhaps find it a hard matter any other way to account for the\ncontrary tenets, which are firmly believed, confidently asserted, and\nwhich great numbers are ready at any time to seal with their blood.\nAnd, indeed, if it be the privilege of innate principles to be received\nupon their own authority, without examination, I know not what may not\nbe believed, or how any one\u2019s principles can be questioned. If they may\nand ought to be examined and tried, I desire to know how first and\ninnate principles can be tried; or at least it is reasonable to demand\nthe MARKS and CHARACTERS whereby the genuine innate principles may be\ndistinguished from others: that so, amidst the great variety of\npretenders, I may be kept from mistakes in so material a point as this.\nWhen this is done, I shall be ready to embrace such welcome and useful\npropositions; and till then I may with modesty doubt; since I fear\nuniversal consent, which is the only one produced, will scarcely prove\na sufficient mark to direct my choice, and assure me of any innate\nprinciples.\nFrom what has been said, I think it past doubt, that there are no\npractical principles wherein all men agree; and therefore none innate.\nCHAPTER IV.\nOTHER CONSIDERATIONS CONCERNING INNATE PRINCIPLES, BOTH SPECULATIVE AND\nPRACTICAL.\n1. Principles not innate, unless their Ideas be innate\nHad those who would persuade us that there are innate principles not\ntaken them together in gross, but considered separately the parts out\nof which those propositions are made, they would not, perhaps, have\nbeen so forward to believe they were innate. Since, if the IDEAS which\nmade up those truths were not, it was impossible that the PROPOSITIONS\nmade up of them should be innate, or our knowledge of them be born with\nus. For, if the ideas be not innate, there was a time when the mind was\nwithout those principles; and then they will not be innate, but be\nderived from some other original. For, where the ideas themselves are\nnot, there can be no knowledge, no assent, no mental or verbal\npropositions about them.\n2. Ideas, especially those belonging to Principles, not born with\nchildren\nIf we will attentively consider new-born children, we shall have little\nreason to think that they bring many ideas into the world with them.\nFor, bating perhaps some faint ideas of hunger, and thirst, and warmth,\nand some pains, which they may have felt in the womb, there is not the\nleast appearance of any settled ideas at all in them; especially of\nIDEAS ANSWERING THE TERMS WHICH MAKE UP THOSE UNIVERSAL PROPOSITIONS\nTHAT ARE ESTEEMED INNATE PRINCIPLES. One may perceive how, by degrees,\nafterwards, ideas come into their minds; and that they get no more, nor\nother, than what experience, and the observation of things that come in\ntheir way, furnish them with; which might be enough to satisfy us that\nthey are not original characters stamped on the mind.\n3. Impossibility and Identity not innate ideas\n\u201cIt is impossible for the same thing to be, and not to be,\u201d is\ncertainly (if there be any such) an innate PRINCIPLE. But can any one\nthink, or will any one say, that \u201cimpossibility\u201d and \u201cidentity\u201d are two\ninnate IDEAS? Are they such as all mankind have, and bring into the\nworld with them? And are they those which are the first in children,\nand antecedent to all acquired ones? If they are innate, they must\nneeds be so. Hath a child an idea of impossibility and identity, before\nit has of white or black, sweet or bitter? And is it from the knowledge\nof this principle that it concludes, that wormwood rubbed on the nipple\nhath not the same taste that it used to receive from thence? Is it the\nactual knowledge of IMPOSSIBILE EST IDEM ESSE, ET NON ESSE, that makes\na child distinguish between its mother and a stranger; or that makes it\nfond of the one and flee the other? Or does the mind regulate itself\nand its assent by ideas that it never yet had? Or the understanding\ndraw conclusions from principles which it never yet knew or understood?\nThe names IMPOSSIBILITY and IDENTITY stand for two ideas, so far from\nbeing innate, or born with us, that I think it requires great care and\nattention to form them right in our understandings. They are so far\nfrom being brought into the world with us, so remote from the thoughts\nof infancy and childhood, that I believe, upon examination it will be\nfound that many grown men want them.\n4. Identity, an Idea not innate.\nIf IDENTITY (to instance that alone) be a native impression, and\nconsequently so clear and obvious to us that we must needs know it even\nfrom our cradles, I would gladly be resolved by any one of seven, or\nseventy years old, whether a man, being a creature consisting of soul\nand body, be the same man when his body is changed? Whether Euphorbus\nand Pythagoras, having had the same soul, were the same men, though\nthey lived several ages asunder? Nay, whether the cock too, which had\nthe same soul, were not the same, with both of them? Whereby, perhaps,\nit will appear that our idea of SAMENESS is not so settled and clear as\nto deserve to be thought innate in us. For if those innate ideas are\nnot clear and distinct, so as to be universally known and naturally\nagreed on, they cannot be subjects of universal and undoubted truths,\nbut will be the unavoidable occasion of perpetual uncertainty. For, I\nsuppose every one\u2019s idea of identity will not be the same that\nPythagoras and thousands of his followers have. And which then shall be\ntrue? Which innate? Or are there two different ideas of identity, both\ninnate?\n5. What makes the same man?\nNor let any one think that the questions I have here proposed about the\nidentity of man are bare empty speculations; which, if they were, would\nbe enough to show, that there was in the understandings of men no\ninnate idea of identity. He that shall with a little attention reflect\non the resurrection, and consider that divine justice will bring to\njudgment, at the last day, the very same persons, to be happy or\nmiserable in the other, who did well or ill in this life, will find it\nperhaps not easy to resolve with himself, what makes the same man, or\nwherein identity consists; and will not be forward to think he, and\nevery one, even children themselves, have naturally a clear idea of it.\n6. Whole and Part not innate ideas.\nLet us examine that principle of mathematics, viz. THAT THE WHOLE IS\nBIGGER THAN A PART. This, I take it, is reckoned amongst innate\nprinciples. I am sure it has as good a title as any to be thought so;\nwhich yet nobody can think it to be, when he considers the ideas it\ncomprehends in it, WHOLE and PART, are perfectly relative; but the\npositive ideas to which they properly and immediately belong are\nextension and number, of which alone whole and part are relations. So\nthat if whole and part are innate ideas, extension and number must be\nso too; it being impossible to have an idea of a relation, without\nhaving any at all of the thing to which it belongs, and in which it is\nfounded. Now, whether the minds of men have naturally imprinted on them\nthe ideas of extension and number, I leave to be considered by those\nwho are the patrons of innate principles.\n7. Idea of Worship not innate.\nThat GOD IS TO BE WORSHIPPED, is, without doubt, as great a truth as\nany that can enter into the mind of man, and deserves the first place\namongst all practical principles. But yet it can by no means be thought\ninnate, unless the ideas of GOD and WORSHIP are innate. That the idea\nthe term worship stands for is not in the understanding of children,\nand a character stamped on the mind in its first original, I think will\nbe easily granted, by any one that considers how few there be amongst\ngrown men who have a clear and distinct notion of it. And, I suppose,\nthere cannot be anything more ridiculous than to say, that children\nhave this practical principle innate, \u201cThat God is to be worshipped,\u201d\nand yet that they know not what that worship of God is, which is their\nduty. But to pass by this.\n8. Idea of God not innate.\nIf any idea can be imagined innate, the idea of GOD may, of all others,\nfor many reasons, be thought so; since it is hard to conceive how there\nshould be innate moral principles, without an innate idea of a Deity.\nWithout a notion of a law-maker, it is impossible to have a notion of a\nlaw, and an obligation to observe it. Besides the atheists taken notice\nof amongst the ancients, and left branded upon the records of history,\nhath not navigation discovered, in these later ages, whole nations, at\nthe bay of Soldania, in Brazil, and in the Caribbee islands, &c.,\namongst whom there was to be found no notion of a God, no religion?\nNicholaus del Techo, in Literis ex Paraquaria, de Caiguarum\nConversione, has these words: Reperi eam gentem nullum nomen habere\nquod Deum, et hominis animam significet; nulla sacra habet, nulla\nidola.\nAnd perhaps, if we should with attention mind the lives and discourses\nof people not so far off, we should have too much reason to fear, that\nmany, in more civilized countries, have no very strong and clear\nimpressions of a Deity upon their minds, and that the complaints of\natheism made from the pulpit are not without reason. And though only\nsome profligate wretches own it too barefacedly now; yet perhaps we\nshould hear more than we do of it from others, did not the fear of the\nmagistrate\u2019s sword, or their neighbour\u2019s censure, tie up people\u2019s\ntongues; which, were the apprehensions of punishment or shame taken\naway, would as openly proclaim their atheism as their lives do.\n9. The name of God not universal or obscure in meaning.\nBut had all mankind everywhere a notion of a God, (whereof yet history\ntells us the contrary,) it would not from thence follow, that the idea\nof him was innate. For, though no nation were to be found without a\nname, and some few dark notions of him, yet that would not prove them\nto be natural impressions on the mind; no more than the names of fire,\nor the sun, heat, or number, do prove the ideas they stand for to be\ninnate; because the names of those things, and the ideas of them, are\nso universally received and known amongst mankind. Nor, on the\ncontrary, is the want of such a name, or the absence of such a notion\nout of men\u2019s minds, any argument against the being of a God; any more\nthan it would be a proof that there was no loadstone in the world,\nbecause a great part of mankind had neither a notion of any such thing\nnor a name for it; or be any show of argument to prove that there are\nno distinct and various species of angels, or intelligent beings above\nus, because we have no ideas of such distinct species, or names for\nthem. For, men being furnished with words, by the common language of\ntheir own countries, can scarce avoid having some kind of ideas of\nthose things whose names those they converse with have occasion\nfrequently to mention to them. And if they carry with it the notion of\nexcellency, greatness, or something extraordinary; if apprehension and\nconcernment accompany it; if the fear of absolute and irresistible\npower set it on upon the mind,\u2014the idea is likely to sink the deeper,\nand spread the further; especially if it be such an idea as is\nagreeable to the common light of reason, and naturally deducible from\nevery part of our knowledge, as that of a God is. For the visible marks\nof extraordinary wisdom and power appear so plainly in all the works of\nthe creation, that a rational creature, who will but seriously reflect\non them, cannot miss the discovery of a Deity. And the influence that\nthe discovery of such a Being must necessarily have on the minds of all\nthat have but once heard of it is so great, and carries such a weight\nof thought and communication with it, that it seems stranger to me that\na whole nation of men should be anywhere found so brutish as to want\nthe notion of a God, than that they should be without any notion of\nnumbers, or fire.\n10. Ideas of God and idea of Fire.\nThe name of God being once mentioned in any part of the world, to\nexpress a superior, powerful, wise, invisible Being, the suitableness\nof such a notion to the principles of common reason, and the interest\nmen will always have to mention it often, must necessarily spread it\nfar and wide; and continue it down to all generations: though yet the\ngeneral reception of this name, and some imperfect and unsteady notions\nconveyed thereby to the unthinking part of mankind, prove not the idea\nto be innate; but only that they who made the discovery had made a\nright use of their reason, thought maturely of the causes of things,\nand traced them to their original; from whom other less considering\npeople having once received so important a notion, it could not easily\nbe lost again.\n11. Idea of God not innate.\nThis is all could be inferred from the notion of a God, were it to be\nfound universally in all the tribes of mankind, and generally\nacknowledged, by men grown to maturity in all countries. For the\ngenerality of the acknowledging of a God, as I imagine, is extended no\nfurther than that; which, if it be sufficient to prove the idea of God\ninnate, will as well prove the idea of fire innate; since I think it\nmay be truly said, that there is not a person in the world who has a\nnotion of a God, who has not also the idea of fire. I doubt not but if\na colony of young children should be placed in an island where no fire\nwas, they would certainly neither have any notion of such a thing, nor\nname for it, how generally soever it were received and known in all the\nworld besides; and perhaps too their apprehensions would be as far\nremoved from any name, or notion, of a God, till some one amongst them\nhad employed his thoughts to inquire into the constitution and causes\nof things, which would easily lead him to the notion of a God; which\nhaving once taught to others, reason, and the natural propensity of\ntheir own thoughts, would afterwards propagate, and continue amongst\nthem.\n12. Suitable to God\u2019s goodness, that all Men should have an idea of\nHim, therefore naturally imprinted by Him, answered.\nIndeed it is urged, that it is suitable to the goodness of God, to\nimprint upon the minds of men characters and notions of himself, and\nnot to leave them in the dark and doubt in so grand a concernment; and\nalso, by that means, to secure to himself the homage and veneration due\nfrom so intelligent a creature as man; and therefore he has done it.\nThis argument, if it be of any force, will prove much more than those\nwho use it in this case expect from it. For, if we may conclude that\nGod hath done for men all that men shall judge is best for them,\nbecause it is suitable to his goodness so to do, it will prove, not\nonly that God has imprinted on the minds of men an idea of himself, but\nthat he hath plainly stamped there, in fair characters, all that men\nought to know or believe of him; all that they ought to do in obedience\nto his will; and that he hath given them a will and affections\nconformable to it. This, no doubt, every one will think better for men,\nthan that they should, in the dark, grope after knowledge, as St. Paul\ntells us all nations did after God (Acts xvii. 27); than that their\nwills should clash with their understandings, and their appetites cross\ntheir duty. The Romanists say it is best for men, and so suitable to\nthe goodness of God, that there should be an infallible judge of\ncontroversies on earth; and therefore there is one. And I, by the same\nreason, say it is better for men that every man himself should be\ninfallible. I leave them to consider, whether, by the force of this\nargument, they shall think that every man IS so. I think it a very good\nargument to say,\u2014the infinitely wise God hath made it so; and therefore\nit is best. But it seems to me a little too much confidence of our own\nwisdom to say,\u2014\u2018I think it best; and therefore God hath made it so.\u2019\nAnd in the matter in hand, it will be in vain to argue from such a\ntopic, that God hath done so, when certain experience shows us that he\nhath not. But the goodness of God hath not been wanting to men, without\nsuch original impressions of knowledge or ideas stamped on the mind;\nsince he hath furnished man with those faculties which will serve for\nthe sufficient discovery of all things requisite to the end of such a\nbeing; and I doubt not but to show, that a man, by the right use of his\nnatural abilities, may, without any innate principles, attain a\nknowledge of a God, and other things that concern him. God having\nendued man with those faculties of knowledge which he hath, was no more\nobliged by his goodness to plant those innate notions in his mind, than\nthat, having given him reason, hands, and materials, he should build\nhim bridges or houses,\u2014which some people in the world, however of good\nparts, do either totally want, or are but ill provided of, as well as\nothers are wholly without ideas of God and principles of morality, or\nat least have but very ill ones; the reason in both cases being, that\nthey never employed their parts, faculties, and powers industriously\nthat way, but contented themselves with the opinions, fashions, and\nthings of their country, as they found them, without looking any\nfurther. Had you or I been born at the Bay of Soldania, possibly our\nthoughts and notions had not exceeded those brutish ones of the\nHottentots that inhabit there. And had the Virginia king Apochancana\nbeen educated in England, he had been perhaps as knowing a divine, and\nas good a mathematician as any in it; the difference between him and a\nmore improved Englishman lying barely in this, that the exercise of his\nfaculties was bounded within the ways, modes, and notions of his own\ncountry, and never directed to any other or further inquiries. And if\nhe had not any idea of a God, it was only because he pursued not those\nthoughts that would have led him to it.\n13. Ideas of God various in different Men.\nI grant that if there were any ideas to be found imprinted on the minds\nof men, we have reason to expect it should be the notion of his Maker,\nas a mark God set on his own workmanship, to mind man of his dependence\nand duty; and that herein should appear the first instances of human\nknowledge. But how late is it before any such notion is discoverable in\nchildren? And when we find it there, how much more does it resemble the\nopinion and notion of the teacher, than represent the true God? He that\nshall observe in children the progress whereby their minds attain the\nknowledge they have, will think that the objects they do first and most\nfamiliarly converse with are those that make the first impressions on\ntheir understandings; nor will he find the least footsteps of any\nother. It is easy to take notice how their thoughts enlarge themselves,\nonly as they come to be acquainted with a greater variety of sensible\nobjects; to retain the ideas of them in their memories; and to get the\nskill to compound and enlarge them, and several ways put them together.\nHow, by these means, they come to frame in their minds an idea men have\nof a Deity, I shall hereafter show.\n14. Contrary and inconsistent ideas of God under the same name.\nCan it be thought that the ideas men have of God are the characters and\nmarks of himself, engraven in their minds by his own finger, when we\nsee that, in the same country, under one and the same name, men have\nfar different, nay often contrary and inconsistent ideas and\nconceptions of him? Their agreeing in a name, or sound, will scarce\nprove an innate notion of him.\n15. Gross ideas of God.\nWhat true or tolerable notion of a Deity could they have, who\nacknowledged and worshipped hundreds? Every deity that they owned above\none was an infallible evidence of their ignorance of Him, and a proof\nthat they had no true notion of God, where unity, infinity, and\neternity were excluded. To which, if we add their gross conceptions of\ncorporeity, expressed in their images and representations of their\ndeities; the amours, marriages, copulations, lusts, quarrels, and other\nmean qualities attributed by them to their gods; we shall have little\nreason to think that the heathen world, i.e. the greatest part of\nmankind, had such ideas of God in their minds as he himself, out of\ncare that they should not be mistaken about him, was author of. And\nthis universality of consent, so much argued, if it prove any native\nimpressions, it will be only this:\u2014that God imprinted on the minds of\nall men speaking the same language, a NAME for himself, but not any\nIDEA; since those people who agreed in the name, had, at the same time,\nfar different apprehensions about the thing signified. If they say that\nthe variety of deities worshipped by the heathen world were but\nfigurative ways of expressing the several attributes of that\nincomprehensible Being, or several parts of his providence, I answer:\nwhat they might be in the original I will not here inquire; but that\nthey were so in the thoughts of the vulgar I think nobody will affirm.\nAnd he that will consult the voyage of the Bishop of Beryte, c. 13,\n(not to mention other testimonies,) will find that the theology of the\nSiamites professedly owns a plurality of gods: or, as the Abbe de\nChoisy more judiciously remarks in his Journal du Voyage de Siam,\n107/177, it consists properly in acknowledging no God at all.\n16. Idea of God not innate although wise men of all nations come to\nhave it.\nIf it be said, that wise men of all nations came to have true\nconceptions of the unity and infinity of the Deity, I grant it. But\nthen this,\nFirst, excludes universality of consent in anything but the name; for\nthose wise men being very few, perhaps one of a thousand, this\nuniversality is very narrow.\nSecondly, it seems to me plainly to prove, that the truest and best\nnotions men have of God were not imprinted, but acquired by thought and\nmeditation, and a right use of their faculties: since the wise and\nconsiderate men of the world, by a right and careful employment of\ntheir thoughts and reason, attained true notions in this as well as\nother things; whilst the lazy and inconsiderate part of men, making far\nthe greater number, took up their notions by chance, from common\ntradition and vulgar conceptions, without much beating their heads\nabout them. And if it be a reason to think the notion of God innate,\nbecause all wise men had it, virtue too must be thought innate; for\nthat also wise men have always had.\n17. Odd, low, and pitiful ideas of God common among men.\nThis was evidently the case of all Gentilism. Nor hath even amongst\nJews, Christians, and Mahometans, who acknowledged but one God, this\ndoctrine, and the care taken in those nations to teach men to have true\nnotions of a God, prevailed so far as to make men to have the same and\nthe true ideas of him. How many even amongst us, will be found upon\ninquiry to fancy him in the shape of a man sitting in heaven; and to\nhave many other absurd and unfit conceptions of him? Christians as well\nas Turks have had whole sects owning and contending earnestly for\nit,\u2014that the Deity was corporeal, and of human shape: and though we\nfind few now amongst us who profess themselves Anthropomorphites,\n(though some I have met with that own it,) yet I believe he that will\nmake it his business may find amongst the ignorant and uninstructed\nChristians many of that opinion. Talk but with country people, almost\nof any age, or young people almost of any condition, and you shall find\nthat, though the name of God be frequently in their mouths, yet the\nnotions they apply this name to are so odd, low, and pitiful, that\nnobody can imagine they were taught by a rational man; much less that\nthey were characters written by the finger of God himself. Nor do I see\nhow it derogates more from the goodness of God, that he has given us\nminds unfurnished with these ideas of himself, than that he hath sent\nus into the world with bodies unclothed; and that there is no art or\nskill born with us. For, being fitted with faculties to attain these,\nit is want of industry and consideration in us, and not of bounty in\nhim, if we have them not. It is as certain that there is a God, as that\nthe opposite angles made by the intersection of two straight lines are\nequal. There was never any rational creature that set himself sincerely\nto examine the truth of these propositions that could fail to assent to\nthem; though yet it be past doubt that there are many men, who, having\nnot applied their thoughts that way, are ignorant both of the one and\nthe other. If any one think fit to call this (which is the utmost of\nits extent) UNIVERSAL CONSENT, such an one I easily allow; but such an\nuniversal consent as this proves not the idea of God, any more than it\ndoes the idea of such angles, innate.\n18. If the Idea of God be not innate, no other can be supposed innate.\nSince then though the knowledge of a God be the most natural discovery\nof human reason, yet the idea of him is not innate, as I think is\nevident from what has been said; I imagine there will be scarce any\nother idea found that can pretend to it. Since if God hath set any\nimpression, any character, on the understanding of men, it is most\nreasonable to expect it should have been some clear and uniform idea of\nHimself; as far as our weak capacities were capable to receive so\nincomprehensible and infinite an object. But our minds being at first\nvoid of that idea which we are most concerned to have, it is a strong\npresumption against all other innate characters. I must own, as far as\nI can observe, I can find none, and would be glad to be informed by any\nother.\n19. Idea of Substance not innate.\nI confess there is another idea which would be of general use for\nmankind to have, as it is of general talk as if they had it; and that\nis the idea of SUBSTANCE; which we neither have nor can have by\nsensation or reflection. If nature took care to provide us any ideas,\nwe might well expect they should be such as by our own faculties we\ncannot procure to ourselves; but we see, on the contrary, that since,\nby those ways whereby other ideas are brought into our minds, this is\nnot, we have no such clear idea at all; and therefore signify nothing\nby the word SUBSTANCE but only an uncertain supposition of we know not\nwhat, i. e. of something whereof we have no idea, which we take to be\nthe substratum, or support, of those ideas we do know.\n20. No Propositions can be innate, since no Ideas are innate.\nWhatever then we talk of innate, either speculative or practical,\nprinciples, it may with as much probability be said, that a man hath\n100 pounds sterling in his pocket, and yet denied that he hath there\neither penny, shilling, crown, or other coin out of which the sum is to\nbe made up; as to think that certain PROPOSITIONS are innate when the\nIDEAS about which they are can by no means be supposed to be so. The\ngeneral reception and assent that is given doth not at all prove, that\nthe ideas expressed in them are innate; for in many cases, however the\nideas came there, the assent to words expressing the agreement or\ndisagreement of such ideas, will necessarily follow. Every one that\nhath a true idea of GOD and WORSHIP, will assent to this proposition,\n\u2018That God is to be worshipped,\u2019 when expressed in a language he\nunderstands; and every rational man that hath not thought on it to-day,\nmay be ready to assent to this proposition to-morrow; and yet millions\nof men may be well supposed to want one or both those ideas to-day.\nFor, if we will allow savages, and most country people, to have ideas\nof God and worship, (which conversation with them will not make one\nforward to believe,) yet I think few children can be supposed to have\nthose ideas, which therefore they must begin to have some time or\nother; and then they will also begin to assent to that proposition, and\nmake very little question of it ever after. But such an assent upon\nhearing, no more proves the IDEAS to be innate, than it does that one\nborn blind (with cataracts which will be couched to-morrow) had the\ninnate ideas of the sun, or light, or saffron, or yellow; because, when\nhis sight is cleared, he will certainly assent to this proposition,\n\u201cThat the sun is lucid, or that saffron is yellow.\u201d And therefore, if\nsuch an assent upon hearing cannot prove the ideas innate, it can much\nless the PROPOSITIONS made up of those ideas. If they have any innate\nideas, I would be glad to be told what, and how many, they are.\n21. No innate Ideas in the Memory.\nTo which let me add: if there be any innate ideas, any ideas in the\nmind which the mind does not actually think on, they must be lodged in\nthe memory; and from thence must be brought into view by remembrance;\ni. e. must be known, when they are remembered, to have been perceptions\nin the mind before; unless remembrance can be without remembrance. For,\nto remember is to perceive anything with memory, or with a\nconsciousness that it was perceived or known before. Without this,\nwhatever idea comes into the mind is new, and not remembered; this\nconsciousness of its having been in the mind before, being that which\ndistinguishes remembering from all other ways of thinking. Whatever\nidea was never PERCEIVED by the mind was never in the mind. Whatever\nidea is in the mind, is, either an actual perception, or else, having\nbeen an actual perception, is so in the mind that, by the memory, it\ncan be made an actual perception again. Whenever there is the actual\nperception of any idea without memory, the idea appears perfectly new\nand unknown before to the understanding. Whenever the memory brings any\nidea into actual view, it is with a consciousness that it had been\nthere before, and was not wholly a stranger to the mind. Whether this\nbe not so, I appeal to every one\u2019s observation. And then I desire an\ninstance of an idea, pretended to be innate, which (before any\nimpression of it by ways hereafter to be mentioned) any one could\nrevive and remember, as an idea he had formerly known; without which\nconsciousness of a former perception there is no remembrance; and\nwhatever idea comes into the mind without THAT consciousness is not\nremembered, or comes not out of the memory, nor can be said to be in\nthe mind before that appearance. For what is not either actually in\nview or in the memory, is in the mind no way at all, and is all one as\nif it had never been there. Suppose a child had the use of his eyes\ntill he knows and distinguishes colours; but then cataracts shut the\nwindows, and he is forty or fifty years perfectly in the dark; and in\nthat time perfectly loses all memory of the ideas of colours he once\nhad. This was the case of a blind man I once talked with, who lost his\nsight by the small-pox when he was a child, and had no more notion of\ncolours than one born blind. I ask whether any one can say this man had\nthen any ideas of colours in his mind, any more than one born blind?\nAnd I think nobody will say that either of them had in his mind any\nideas of colours at all. His cataracts are couched, and then he has the\nideas (which he remembers not) of colours, DE NOVO, by his restored\nsight, conveyed to his mind, and that without any consciousness of a\nformer acquaintance. And these now he can revive and call to mind in\nthe dark. In this case all these ideas of colours which, when out of\nview, can be revived with a consciousness of a former acquaintance,\nbeing thus in the memory, are said to be in the mind. The use I make of\nthis is,\u2014that whatever idea, being not actually in view, is in the\nmind, is there only by being in the memory; and if it be not in the\nmemory, it is not in the mind; and if it be in the memory, it cannot by\nthe memory be brought into actual view without a perception that it\ncomes out of the memory; which is this, that it had been known before,\nand is now remembered. If therefore there be any innate ideas, they\nmust be in the memory, or else nowhere in the mind; and if they be in\nthe memory, they can be revived without any impression from without;\nand whenever they are brought into the mind they are remembered, i. e.\nthey bring with them a perception of their not being wholly new to it.\nThis being a constant and distinguishing difference between what is,\nand what is not in the memory, or in the mind;\u2014that what is not in the\nmemory, whenever it appears there, appears perfectly new and unknown\nbefore; and what is in the memory, or in the mind, whenever it is\nsuggested by the memory, appears not to be new, but the mind finds it\nin itself, and knows it was there before. By this it may be tried\nwhether there be any innate ideas in the mind before impression from\nsensation or reflection. I would fain meet with the man who, when he\ncame to the use of reason, or at any other time, remembered any of\nthem; and to whom, after he was born, they were never new. If any one\nwill say, there are ideas in the mind that are NOT in the memory, I\ndesire him to explain himself, and make what he says intelligible.\n22. Principles not innate, because of little use or little certainty.\nBesides what I have already said, there is another reason why I doubt\nthat neither these nor any other principles are innate. I that am fully\npersuaded that the infinitely wise God made all things in perfect\nwisdom, cannot satisfy myself why he should be supposed to print upon\nthe minds of men some universal principles; whereof those that are\npretended innate, and concern SPECULATION, are of no great use; and\nthose that concern PRACTICE, not self-evident; and neither of them\ndistinguishable from some other truths not allowed to be innate. For,\nto what purpose should characters be graven on the mind by the finger\nof God, which are not clearer there than those which are afterwards\nintroduced, or cannot be distinguished from them? If any one thinks\nthere are such innate ideas and propositions, which by their clearness\nand usefulness are distinguishable from all that is adventitious in the\nmind and acquired, it will not be a hard matter for him to tell us\nWHICH THEY ARE; and then every one will be a fit judge whether they be\nso or no. Since if there be such innate ideas and impressions, plainly\ndifferent from all other perceptions and knowledge, every one will find\nit true in himself. Of the evidence of these supposed innate maxims, I\nhave spoken already: of their usefulness I shall have occasion to speak\nmore hereafter.\n23. Difference of Men\u2019s Discoveries depends upon the different\nApplication of their Faculties.\nTo conclude: some ideas forwardly offer themselves to all men\u2019s\nunderstanding; and some sorts of truths result from any ideas, as soon\nas the mind puts them into propositions: other truths require a train\nof ideas placed in order, a due comparing of them, and deductions made\nwith attention, before they can be discovered and assented to. Some of\nthe first sort, because of their general and easy reception, have been\nmistaken for innate: but the truth is, ideas and notions are no more\nborn with us than arts and sciences; though some of them indeed offer\nthemselves to our faculties more readily than others; and therefore are\nmore generally received: though that too be according as the organs of\nour bodies and powers of our minds happen to be employed; God having\nfitted men with faculties and means to discover, receive, and retain\ntruths, according as they are employed. The great difference that is to\nbe found in the notions of mankind is, from the different use they put\ntheir faculties to. Whilst some (and those the most) taking things upon\ntrust, misemploy their power of assent, by lazily enslaving their minds\nto the dictates and dominion of others, in doctrines which it is their\nduty carefully to examine, and not blindly, with an implicit faith, to\nswallow; others, employing their thoughts only about some few things,\ngrow acquainted sufficiently with them, attain great degrees of\nknowledge in them, and are ignorant of all other, having never let\ntheir thoughts loose in the search of other inquiries. Thus, that the\nthree angles of a triangle are quite equal to two right ones is a truth\nas certain as anything can be, and I think more evident than many of\nthose propositions that go for principles; and yet there are millions,\nhowever expert in other things, who know not this at all, because they\nnever set their thoughts on work about such angles. And he that\ncertainly knows this proposition may yet be utterly ignorant of the\ntruth of other propositions, in mathematics itself, which are as clear\nand evident as this; because, in his search of those mathematical\ntruths, he stopped his thoughts short and went not so far. The same may\nhappen concerning the notions we have of the being of a Deity. For,\nthough there be no truth which a man may more evidently make out to\nhimself than the existence of a God, yet he that shall content himself\nwith things as he finds them in this world, as they minister to his\npleasures and passions, and not make inquiry a little further into\ntheir causes, ends, and admirable contrivances, and pursue the thoughts\nthereof with diligence and attention, may live long without any notion\nof such a Being. And if any person hath by talk put such a notion into\nhis head, he may perhaps believe it; but if he hath never examined it,\nhis knowledge of it will be no perfecter than his, who having been\ntold, that the three angles of a triangle are equal to two right ones,\ntakes it upon trust, without examining the demonstration; and may yield\nhis assent as a probable opinion, but hath no knowledge of the truth of\nit; which yet his faculties, if carefully employed, were able to make\nclear and evident to him. But this only, by the by, to show how much\nOUR KNOWLEDGE DEPENDS UPON THE RIGHT USE OF THOSE POWERS NATURE HATH\nBESTOWED UPON US, and how little upon SUCH INNATE PRINCIPLES AS ARE IN\nVAIN SUPPOSED TO BE IN ALL MANKIND FOR THEIR DIRECTION; which all men\ncould not but know if they were there, or else they would be there to\nno purpose. And which since all men do not know, nor can distinguish\nfrom other adventitious truths, we may well conclude there are no such.\n24. Men must think and know for themselves.\nWhat censure doubting thus of innate principles may deserve from men,\nwho will be apt to call it pulling up the old foundations of knowledge\nand certainty, I cannot tell;\u2014I persuade myself at least that the way I\nhave pursued, being conformable to truth, lays those foundations surer.\nThis I am certain, I have not made it my business either to quit or\nfollow any authority in the ensuing Discourse. Truth has been my only\naim; and wherever that has appeared to lead, my thoughts have\nimpartially followed, without minding whether the footsteps of any\nother lay that way or not. Not that I want a due respect to other men\u2019s\nopinions; but, after all, the greatest reverence is due to truth: and I\nhope it will not be thought arrogance to say, that perhaps we should\nmake greater progress in the discovery of rational and contemplative\nknowledge, if we sought it in the fountain, IN THE CONSIDERATION OF\nTHINGS THEMSELVES; and made use rather of our own thoughts than other\nmen\u2019s to find it. For I think we may as rationally hope to see with\nother men\u2019s eyes, as to know by other men\u2019s understandings. So much as\nwe ourselves consider and comprehend of truth and reason, so much we\npossess of real and true knowledge. The floating of other men\u2019s\nopinions in our brains, makes us not one jot the more knowing, though\nthey happen to be true. What in them was science, is in us but\nopiniatrety; whilst we give up our assent only to reverend names, and\ndo not, as they did, employ our own reason to understand those truths\nwhich gave them reputation. Aristotle was certainly a knowing man, but\nnobody ever thought him so because he blindly embraced, and confidently\nvented the opinions of another. And if the taking up of another\u2019s\nprinciples, without examining them, made not him a philosopher, I\nsuppose it will hardly make anybody else so. In the sciences, every one\nhas so much as he really knows and comprehends. What he believes only,\nand takes upon trust, are but shreds; which, however well in the whole\npiece, make no considerable addition to his stock who gathers them.\nSuch borrowed wealth, like fairy money, though it were gold in the hand\nfrom which he received it, will be but leaves and dust when it comes to\nuse.\n25. Whence the Opinion of Innate Principles.\nWhen men have found some general propositions that could not be doubted\nof as soon as understood, it was, I know, a short and easy way to\nconclude them innate. This being once received, it eased the lazy from\nthe pains of search, and stopped the inquiry of the doubtful concerning\nall that was once styled innate. And it was of no small advantage to\nthose who affected to be masters and teachers, to make this the\nprinciple of principles,\u2014THAT PRINCIPLES MUST NOT BE QUESTIONED. For,\nhaving once established this tenet,\u2014that there are innate principles,\nit put their followers upon a necessity of receiving SOME doctrines as\nsuch; which was to take them off from the use of their own reason and\njudgment, and put them on believing and taking them upon trust without\nfurther examination: in which posture of blind credulity, they might be\nmore easily governed by, and made useful to some sort of men, who had\nthe skill and office to principle and guide them. Nor is it a small\npower it gives one man over another, to have the authority to be the\ndictator of principles, and teacher of unquestionable truths; and to\nmake a man swallow that for an innate principle which may serve to his\npurpose who teacheth them. Whereas had they examined the ways whereby\nmen came to the knowledge of many universal truths, they would have\nfound them to result in the minds of men from the being of things\nthemselves, when duly considered; and that they were discovered by the\napplication of those faculties that were fitted by nature to receive\nand judge of them, when duly employed about them.\n26. Conclusion.\nTo show HOW the understanding proceeds herein is the design of the\nfollowing Discourse; which I shall proceed to when I have first\npremised, that hitherto,\u2014to clear my way to those foundations which I\nconceive are the only true ones, whereon to establish those notions we\ncan have of our own knowledge,\u2014it hath been necessary for me to give an\naccount of the reasons I had to doubt of innate principles. And since\nthe arguments which are against them do, some of them, rise from common\nreceived opinions, I have been forced to take several things for\ngranted; which is hardly avoidable to any one, whose task is to show\nthe falsehood or improbability of any tenet;\u2014it happening in\ncontroversial discourses as it does in assaulting of towns; where, if\nthe ground be but firm whereon the batteries are erected, there is no\nfurther inquiry of whom it is borrowed, nor whom it belongs to, so it\naffords but a fit rise for the present purpose. But in the future part\nof this Discourse, designing to raise an edifice uniform and consistent\nwith itself, as far as my own experience and observation will assist\nme, I hope to erect it on such a basis that I shall not need to shore\nit up with props and buttresses, leaning on borrowed or begged\nfoundations: or at least, if mine prove a castle in the air, I will\nendeavour it shall be all of a piece and hang together. Wherein I warn\nthe reader not to expect undeniable cogent demonstrations, unless I may\nbe allowed the privilege, not seldom assumed by others, to take my\nprinciples for granted; and then, I doubt not, but I can demonstrate\ntoo. All that I shall say for the principles I proceed on is, that I\ncan only appeal to men\u2019s own unprejudiced experience and observation\nwhether they be true or not; and this is enough for a man who professes\nno more than to lay down candidly and freely his own conjectures,\nconcerning a subject lying somewhat in the dark, without any other\ndesign than an unbiassed inquiry after truth.\nBOOK II\nOF IDEAS\nCHAPTER I.\nOF IDEAS IN GENERAL, AND THEIR ORIGINAL.\n1. Idea is the Object of Thinking.\nEvery man being conscious to himself that he thinks; and that which his\nmind is applied about whilst thinking being the IDEAS that are there,\nit is past doubt that men have in their minds several ideas,\u2014such as\nare those expressed by the words whiteness, hardness, sweetness,\nthinking, motion, man, elephant, army, drunkenness, and others: it is\nin the first place then to be inquired, HOW HE COMES BY THEM?\nI know it is a received doctrine, that men have native ideas, and\noriginal characters, stamped upon their minds in their very first\nbeing. This opinion I have at large examined already; and, I suppose\nwhat I have said in the foregoing Book will be much more easily\nadmitted, when I have shown whence the understanding may get all the\nideas it has; and by what ways and degrees they may come into the\nmind;\u2014for which I shall appeal to every one\u2019s own observation and\nexperience.\n2. All Ideas come from Sensation or Reflection.\nLet us then suppose the mind to be, as we say, white paper, void of all\ncharacters, without any ideas:\u2014How comes it to be furnished? Whence\ncomes it by that vast store which the busy and boundless fancy of man\nhas painted on it with an almost endless variety? Whence has it all the\nMATERIALS of reason and knowledge? To this I answer, in one word, from\nEXPERIENCE. In that all our knowledge is founded; and from that it\nultimately derives itself. Our observation employed either, about\nexternal sensible objects, or about the internal operations of our\nminds perceived and reflected on by ourselves, is that which supplies\nour understandings with all the MATERIALS of thinking. These two are\nthe fountains of knowledge, from whence all the ideas we have, or can\nnaturally have, do spring.\n3. The Objects of Sensation one Source of Ideas\nFirst, our Senses, conversant about particular sensible objects, do\nconvey into the mind several distinct perceptions of things, according\nto those various ways wherein those objects do affect them. And thus we\ncome by those IDEAS we have of yellow, white, heat, cold, soft, hard,\nbitter, sweet, and all those which we call sensible qualities; which\nwhen I say the senses convey into the mind, I mean, they from external\nobjects convey into the mind what produces there those perceptions.\nThis great source of most of the ideas we have, depending wholly upon\nour senses, and derived by them to the understanding, I call SENSATION.\n4. The Operations of our Minds, the other Source of them.\nSecondly, the other fountain from which experience furnisheth the\nunderstanding with ideas is,\u2014the perception of the operations of our\nown mind within us, as it is employed about the ideas it has got;\u2014which\noperations, when the soul comes to reflect on and consider, do furnish\nthe understanding with another set of ideas, which could not be had\nfrom things without. And such are perception, thinking, doubting,\nbelieving, reasoning, knowing, willing, and all the different actings\nof our own minds;\u2014which we being conscious of, and observing in\nourselves, do from these receive into our understandings as distinct\nideas as we do from bodies affecting our senses. This source of ideas\nevery man has wholly in himself; and though it be not sense, as having\nnothing to do with external objects, yet it is very like it, and might\nproperly enough be called INTERNAL SENSE. But as I call the other\nSensation, so I call this REFLECTION, the ideas it affords being such\nonly as the mind gets by reflecting on its own operations within\nitself. By reflection then, in the following part of this discourse, I\nwould be understood to mean, that notice which the mind takes of its\nown operations, and the manner of them, by reason whereof there come to\nbe ideas of these operations in the understanding. These two, I say,\nviz. external material things, as the objects of SENSATION, and the\noperations of our own minds within, as the objects of REFLECTION, are\nto me the only originals from whence all our ideas take their\nbeginnings. The term OPERATIONS here I use in a large sense, as\ncomprehending not barely the actions of the mind about its ideas, but\nsome sort of passions arising sometimes from them, such as is the\nsatisfaction or uneasiness arising from any thought.\n5. All our Ideas are of the one or of the other of these.\nThe understanding seems to me not to have the least glimmering of any\nideas which it doth not receive from one of these two. EXTERNAL OBJECTS\nfurnish the mind with the ideas of sensible qualities, which are all\nthose different perceptions they produce in us; and THE MIND furnishes\nthe understanding with ideas of its own operations.\nThese, when we have taken a full survey of them, and their several\nmodes, and the compositions made out of them we shall find to contain\nall our whole stock of ideas; and that we have nothing in our minds\nwhich did not come in one of these two ways. Let any one examine his\nown thoughts, and thoroughly search into his understanding; and then\nlet him tell me, whether all the original ideas he has there, are any\nother than of the objects of his senses, or of the operations of his\nmind, considered as objects of his reflection. And how great a mass of\nknowledge soever he imagines to be lodged there, he will, upon taking a\nstrict view, see that he has not any idea in his mind but what one of\nthese two have imprinted;\u2014though perhaps, with infinite variety\ncompounded and enlarged by the understanding, as we shall see\nhereafter.\n6. Observable in Children.\nHe that attentively considers the state of a child, at his first coming\ninto the world, will have little reason to think him stored with plenty\nof ideas, that are to be the matter of his future knowledge. It is BY\nDEGREES he comes to be furnished with them. And though the ideas of\nobvious and familiar qualities imprint themselves before the memory\nbegins to keep a register of time or order, yet it is often so late\nbefore some unusual qualities come in the way, that there are few men\nthat cannot recollect the beginning of their acquaintance with them.\nAnd if it were worth while, no doubt a child might be so ordered as to\nhave but a very few, even of the ordinary ideas, till he were grown up\nto a man. But all that are born into the world, being surrounded with\nbodies that perpetually and diversely affect them, variety of ideas,\nwhether care be taken of it or not, are imprinted on the minds of\nchildren. Light and colours are busy at hand everywhere, when the eye\nis but open; sounds and some tangible qualities fail not to solicit\ntheir proper senses, and force an entrance to the mind;\u2014but yet, I\nthink, it will be granted easily, that if a child were kept in a place\nwhere he never saw any other but black and white till he were a man, he\nwould have no more ideas of scarlet or green, than he that from his\nchildhood never tasted an oyster, or a pine-apple, has of those\nparticular relishes.\n7. Men are differently furnished with these, according to the different\nObjects they converse with.\nMen then come to be furnished with fewer or more simple ideas from\nwithout, according as the objects they converse with afford greater or\nless variety; and from the operations of their minds within, according\nas they more or less reflect on them. For, though he that contemplates\nthe operations of his mind, cannot but have plain and clear ideas of\nthem; yet, unless he turn his thoughts that way, and considers them\nATTENTIVELY, he will no more have clear and distinct ideas of all the\noperations of his mind, and all that may be observed therein, than he\nwill have all the particular ideas of any landscape, or of the parts\nand motions of a clock, who will not turn his eyes to it, and with\nattention heed all the parts of it. The picture, or clock may be so\nplaced, that they may come in his way every day; but yet he will have\nbut a confused idea of all the parts they are made up of, till he\napplies himself with attention, to consider them each in particular.\n8. Ideas of Reflection later, because they need Attention.\nAnd hence we see the reason why it is pretty late before most children\nget ideas of the operations of their own minds; and some have not any\nvery clear or perfect ideas of the greatest part of them all their\nlives. Because, though they pass there continually, yet, like floating\nvisions, they make not deep impressions enough to leave in their mind\nclear, distinct, lasting ideas, till the understanding turns inward\nupon itself, reflects on its own operations, and makes them the objects\nof its own contemplation. Children when they come first into it, are\nsurrounded with a world of new things which, by a constant solicitation\nof their senses, draw the mind constantly to them; forward to take\nnotice of new, and apt to be delighted with the variety of changing\nobjects. Thus the first years are usually employed and diverted in\nlooking abroad. Men\u2019s business in them is to acquaint themselves with\nwhat is to be found without; and so growing up in a constant attention\nto outward sensations, seldom make any considerable reflection on what\npasses within them, till they come to be of riper years; and some\nscarce ever at all.\n9. The Soul begins to have Ideas when it begins to perceive.\nTo ask, at what TIME a man has first any ideas, is to ask, when he\nbegins to perceive;\u2014HAVING IDEAS, and PERCEPTION, being the same thing.\nI know it is an opinion, that the soul always thinks, and that it has\nthe actual perception of ideas in itself constantly, as long as it\nexists; and that actual thinking is as inseparable from the soul as\nactual extension is from the body; which if true, to inquire after the\nbeginning of a man\u2019s ideas is the same as to inquire after the\nbeginning of his soul. For, by this account, soul and its ideas, as\nbody and its extension, will begin to exist both at the same time.\n10. The Soul thinks not always; for this wants Proofs.\nBut whether the soul be supposed to exist antecedent to, or coeval\nwith, or some time after the first rudiments of organization, or the\nbeginnings of life in the body, I leave to be disputed by those who\nhave better thought of that matter. I confess myself to have one of\nthose dull souls, that doth not perceive itself always to contemplate\nideas; nor can conceive it any more necessary for the soul always to\nthink, than for the body always to move: the perception of ideas being\n(as I conceive) to the soul, what motion is to the body; not its\nessence, but one of its operations. And therefore, though thinking be\nsupposed never so much the proper action of the soul, yet it is not\nnecessary to suppose that it should be always thinking, always in\naction. That, perhaps, is the privilege of the infinite Author and\nPreserver of all things, who \u201cnever slumbers nor sleeps\u201d; but is not\ncompetent to any finite being, at least not to the soul of man. We know\ncertainly, by experience, that we SOMETIMES think; and thence draw this\ninfallible consequence,\u2014that there is something in us that has a power\nto think. But whether that substance PERPETUALLY thinks or no, we can\nbe no further assured than experience informs us. For, to say that\nactual thinking is essential to the soul, and inseparable from it, is\nto beg what is in question, and not to prove it by reason;\u2014which is\nnecessary to be done, if it be not a self-evident proposition. But\nwhether this, \u201cThat the soul always thinks,\u201d be a self-evident\nproposition, that everybody assents to at first hearing, I appeal to\nmankind. It is doubted whether I thought at all last night or no. The\nquestion being about a matter of fact, it is begging it to bring, as a\nproof for it, an hypothesis, which is the very thing in dispute: by\nwhich way one may prove anything, and it is but supposing that all\nwatches, whilst the balance beats, think, and it is sufficiently\nproved, and past doubt, that my watch thought all last night. But he\nthat would not deceive himself, ought to build his hypothesis on matter\nof fact, and make it out by sensible experience, and not presume on\nmatter of fact, because of his hypothesis, that is, because he supposes\nit to be so; which way of proving amounts to this, that I must\nnecessarily think all last night, because another supposes I always\nthink, though I myself cannot perceive that I always do so.\nBut men in love with their opinions may not only suppose what is in\nquestion, but allege wrong matter of fact. How else could any one make\nit an inference of mine, that a thing is not, because we are not\nsensible of it in our sleep? I do not say there is no SOUL in a man,\nbecause he is not sensible of it in his sleep; but I do say, he cannot\nTHINK at any time, waking or sleeping, without being sensible of it.\nOur being sensible of it is not necessary to anything but to our\nthoughts; and to them it is; and to them it always will be necessary,\ntill we can think without being conscious of it.\n11. It is not always conscious of it.\nI grant that the soul, in a waking man, is never without thought,\nbecause it is the condition of being awake. But whether sleeping\nwithout dreaming be not an affection of the whole man, mind as well as\nbody, may be worth a waking man\u2019s consideration; it being hard to\nconceive that anything should think and not be conscious of it. If the\nsoul doth think in a sleeping man without being conscious of it, I ask\nwhether, during such thinking, it has any pleasure or pain, or be\ncapable of happiness or misery? I am sure the man is not; no more than\nthe bed or earth he lies on. For to be happy or miserable without being\nconscious of it, seems to me utterly inconsistent and impossible. Or if\nit be possible that the SOUL can, whilst the body is sleeping, have its\nthinking, enjoyments, and concerns, its pleasures or pain, apart, which\nthe MAN is not conscious of nor partakes in,\u2014it is certain that\nSocrates asleep and Socrates awake is not the same person; but his soul\nwhen he sleeps, and Socrates the man, consisting of body and soul, when\nhe is waking, are two persons: since waking Socrates has no knowledge\nof, or concernment for that happiness or misery of his soul, which it\nenjoys alone by itself whilst he sleeps, without perceiving anything of\nit; no more than he has for the happiness or misery of a man in the\nIndies, whom he knows not. For, if we take wholly away all\nconsciousness of our actions and sensations, especially of pleasure and\npain, and the concernment that accompanies it, it will be hard to know\nwherein to place personal identity.\n12. If a sleeping Man thinks without knowing it, the sleeping and\nwaking Man are two Persons.\nThe soul, during sound sleep, thinks, say these men. Whilst it thinks\nand perceives, it is capable certainly of those of delight or trouble,\nas well as any other perceptions; and IT must necessarily be CONSCIOUS\nof its own perceptions. But it has all this apart: the sleeping MAN, it\nis plain, is conscious of nothing of all this. Let us suppose, then,\nthe soul of Castor, while he is sleeping, retired from his body; which\nis no impossible supposition for the men I have here to do with, who so\nliberally allow life, without a thinking soul, to all other animals.\nThese men cannot then judge it impossible, or a contradiction, that the\nbody should live without the soul; nor that the soul should subsist and\nthink, or have perception, even perception of happiness or misery,\nwithout the body. Let us then, I say, suppose the soul of Castor\nseparated during his sleep from his body, to think apart. Let us\nsuppose, too, that it chooses for its scene of thinking the body of\nanother man, v. g. Pollux, who is sleeping without a soul. For, if\nCastor\u2019s soul can think, whilst Castor is asleep, what Castor is never\nconscious of, it is no matter what PLACE it chooses to think in. We\nhave here, then, the bodies of two men with only one soul between them,\nwhich we will suppose to sleep and wake by turns; and the soul still\nthinking in the waking man, whereof the sleeping man is never\nconscious, has never the least perception. I ask, then, whether Castor\nand Pollux, thus with only one soul between them, which thinks and\nperceives in one what the other is never conscious of, nor is concerned\nfor, are not two as distinct PERSONS as Castor and Hercules, or as\nSocrates and Plato were? And whether one of them might not be very\nhappy, and the other very miserable? Just by the same reason, they make\nthe soul and the man two persons, who make the soul think apart what\nthe man is not conscious of. For, I suppose nobody will make identity\nof persons to consist in the soul\u2019s being united to the very same\nnumerical particles of matter. For if that be necessary to identity, it\nwill be impossible, in that constant flux of the particles of our\nbodies, that any man should be the same person two days, or two\nmoments, together.\n13. Impossible to convince those that sleep without dreaming, that they\nthink.\nThus, methinks, every drowsy nod shakes their doctrine, who teach that\nthe soul is always thinking. Those, at least, who do at any time SLEEP\nWITHOUT DREAMING, can never be convinced that their thoughts are\nsometimes for four hours busy without their knowing of it; and if they\nare taken in the very act, waked in the middle of that sleeping\ncontemplation, can give no manner of account of it.\n14. That men dream without remembering it, in vain urged.\nIt will perhaps be said,\u2014That the soul thinks even in the soundest\nsleep, but the MEMORY retains it not. That the soul in a sleeping man\nshould be this moment busy a thinking, and the next moment in a waking\nman not remember nor be able to recollect one jot of all those\nthoughts, is very hard to be conceived, and would need some better\nproof than bare assertion to make it be believed. For who can without\nany more ado, but being barely told so, imagine that the greatest part\nof men do, during all their lives, for several hours every day, think\nof something, which if they were asked, even in the middle of these\nthoughts, they could remember nothing at all of? Most men, I think,\npass a great part of their sleep without dreaming. I once knew a man\nthat was bred a scholar, and had no bad memory, who told me he had\nnever dreamed in his life, till he had that fever he was then newly\nrecovered of, which was about the five or six and twentieth year of his\nage. I suppose the world affords more such instances: at least every\none\u2019s acquaintance will furnish him with examples enough of such as\npass most of their nights without dreaming.\n15. Upon this Hypothesis, the Thoughts of a sleeping Man ought to be\nmost rational.\nTo think often, and never to retain it so much as one moment, is a very\nuseless sort of thinking; and the soul, in such a state of thinking,\ndoes very little, if at all, excel that of a looking-glass, which\nconstantly receives variety of images, or ideas, but retains none; they\ndisappear and vanish, and there remain no footsteps of them; the\nlooking-glass is never the better for such ideas, nor the soul for such\nthoughts. Perhaps it will be said, that in a waking MAN the materials\nof the body are employed, and made use of, in thinking; and that the\nmemory of thoughts is retained by the impressions that are made on the\nbrain, and the traces there left after such thinking; but that in the\nthinking of the SOUL, which is not perceived in a sleeping man, there\nthe soul thinks apart, and making no use of the organs of the body,\nleaves no impressions on it, and consequently no memory of such\nthoughts. Not to mention again the absurdity of two distinct persons,\nwhich follows from this supposition, I answer, further,\u2014That whatever\nideas the mind can receive and contemplate without the help of the\nbody, it is reasonable to conclude it can retain without the help of\nthe body too; or else the soul, or any separate spirit, will have but\nlittle advantage by thinking. If it has no memory of its own thoughts;\nif it cannot lay them up for its own use, and be able to recall them\nupon occasion; if it cannot reflect upon what is past, and make use of\nits former experiences, reasonings, and contemplations, to what purpose\ndoes it think? They who make the soul a thinking thing, at this rate,\nwill not make it a much more noble being than those do whom they\ncondemn, for allowing it to be nothing but the subtilist parts of\nmatter. Characters drawn on dust, that the first breath of wind\neffaces; or impressions made on a heap of atoms, or animal spirits, are\naltogether as useful, and render the subject as noble, as the thoughts\nof a soul that perish in thinking; that, once out of sight, are gone\nfor ever, and leave no memory of themselves behind them. Nature never\nmakes excellent things for mean or no uses: and it is hardly to be\nconceived that our infinitely wise Creator should make so admirable a\nfaculty as the power of thinking, that faculty which comes nearest the\nexcellency of his own incomprehensible being, to be so idly and\nuselessly employed, at least a fourth part of its time here, as to\nthink constantly, without remembering any of those thoughts, without\ndoing any good to itself or others, or being any way useful to any\nother part of the creation. If we will examine it, we shall not find, I\nsuppose, the motion of dull and senseless matter, any where in the\nuniverse, made so little use of and so wholly thrown away.\n16. On this Hypothesis, the Soul must have Ideas not derived from\nSensation or Reflection, of which there is no Appearance.\nIt is true, we have sometimes instances of perception whilst we are\nasleep, and retain the memory of those thoughts: but how extravagant\nand incoherent for the most part they are; how little conformable to\nthe perfection and order of a rational being, those who are acquainted\nwith dreams need not be told. This I would willingly be satisfied\nin,\u2014whether the soul, when it thinks thus apart, and as it were\nseparate from the body, acts less rationally than when conjointly with\nit, or no. If its separate thoughts be less rational, then these men\nmust say, that the soul owes the perfection of rational thinking to the\nbody: if it does not, it is a wonder that our dreams should be, for the\nmost part, so frivolous and irrational; and that the soul should retain\nnone of its more rational soliloquies and meditations.\n17. If I think when I know it not, nobody else can know it.\nThose who so confidently tell us that the soul always actually thinks,\nI would they would also tell us, what those ideas are that are in the\nsoul of a child, before or just at the union with the body, before it\nhath received any by sensation. The dreams of sleeping men are, as I\ntake it, all made up of the waking man\u2019s ideas; though for the most\npart oddly put together. It is strange, if the soul has ideas of its\nown that it derived not from sensation or reflection, (as it must have,\nif it thought before it received any impressions from the body,) that\nit should never, in its private thinking, (so private, that the man\nhimself perceives it not,) retain any of them the very moment it wakes\nout of them, and then make the man glad with new discoveries. Who can\nfind it reason that the soul should, in its retirement during sleep,\nhave so many hours\u2019 thoughts, and yet never light on any of those ideas\nit borrowed not from sensation or reflection; or at least preserve the\nmemory of none but such, which, being occasioned from the body, must\nneeds be less natural to a spirit? It is strange the soul should never\nonce in a man\u2019s whole life recall over any of its pure native thoughts,\nand those ideas it had before it borrowed anything from the body; never\nbring into the waking man\u2019s view any other ideas but what have a tang\nof the cask, and manifestly derive their original from that union. If\nit always thinks, and so had ideas before it was united, or before it\nreceived any from the body, it is not to be supposed but that during\nsleep it recollects its native ideas; and during that retirement from\ncommunicating with the body, whilst it thinks by itself, the ideas it\nis busied about should be, sometimes at least, those more natural and\ncongenial ones which it had in itself, underived from the body, or its\nown operations about them: which, since the waking man never remembers,\nwe must from this hypothesis conclude either that the soul remembers\nsomething that the man does not; or else that memory belongs only to\nsuch ideas as are derived from the body, or the mind\u2019s operations about\nthem.\n18. How knows any one that the Soul always thinks? For if it be not a\nself-evident Proposition, it needs Proof.\nI would be glad also to learn from these men who so confidently\npronounce that the human soul, or, which is all one, that a man always\nthinks, how they come to know it; nay, how they come to know that they\nthemselves think, when they themselves do not perceive it. This, I am\nafraid, is to be sure without proofs, and to know without perceiving.\nIt is, I suspect, a confused notion, taken up to serve an hypothesis;\nand none of those clear truths, that either their own evidence forces\nus to admit, or common experience makes it impudence to deny. For the\nmost that can be said of it is, that it is possible the soul may always\nthink, but not always retain it in memory. And I say, it is as possible\nthat the soul may not always think; and much more probable that it\nshould sometimes not think, than that it should often think, and that a\nlong while together, and not be conscious to itself, the next moment\nafter, that it had thought.\n19. That a Man should be busy in Thinking, and yet not retain it the\nnext moment, very improbable.\nTo suppose the soul to think, and the man not to perceive it, is, as\nhas been said, to make two persons in one man. And if one considers\nwell these men\u2019s way of speaking, one should be led into a suspicion\nthat they do so. For those who tell us that the SOUL always thinks, do\nnever, that I remember, say that a MAN always thinks. Can the soul\nthink, and not the man? Or a man think, and not be conscious of it?\nThis, perhaps, would be suspected of jargon in others. If they say the\nman thinks always, but is not always conscious of it, they may as well\nsay his body is extended without having parts. For it is altogether as\nintelligible to say that a body is extended without parts, as that\nanything thinks without being conscious of it, or perceiving that it\ndoes so. They who talk thus may, with as much reason, if it be\nnecessary to their hypothesis, say that a man is always hungry, but\nthat he does not always feel it; whereas hunger consists in that very\nsensation, as thinking consists in being conscious that one thinks. If\nthey say that a man is always conscious to himself of thinking, I ask,\nHow they know it? Consciousness is the perception of what passes in a\nman\u2019s own mind. Can another man perceive that I am conscious of\nanything, when I perceive it not myself? No man\u2019s knowledge here can go\nbeyond his experience. Wake a man out of a sound sleep, and ask him\nwhat he was that moment thinking of. If he himself be conscious of\nnothing he then thought on, he must be a notable diviner of thoughts\nthat can assure him that he was thinking. May he not, with more reason,\nassure him he was not asleep? This is something beyond philosophy; and\nit cannot be less than revelation, that discovers to another thoughts\nin my mind, when I can find none there myself. And they must needs have\na penetrating sight who can certainly see that I think, when I cannot\nperceive it myself, and when I declare that I do not; and yet can see\nthat dogs or elephants do not think, when they give all the\ndemonstration of it imaginable, except only telling us that they do so.\nThis some may suspect to be a step beyond the Rosicrucians; it seeming\neasier to make one\u2019s self invisible to others, than to make another\u2019s\nthoughts visible to me, which are not visible to himself. But it is but\ndefining the soul to be \u201ca substance that always thinks,\u201d and the\nbusiness is done. If such definition be of any authority, I know not\nwhat it can serve for but to make many men suspect that they have no\nsouls at all; since they find a good part of their lives pass away\nwithout thinking. For no definitions that I know, no suppositions of\nany sect, are of force enough to destroy constant experience; and\nperhaps it is the affectation of knowing beyond what we perceive, that\nmakes so much useless dispute and noise in the world.\n20. No ideas but from Sensation and Reflection, evident, if we observe\nChildren.\nI see no reason, therefore, to believe that the soul thinks before the\nsenses have furnished it with ideas to think on; and as those are\nincreased and retained, so it comes, by exercise, to improve its\nfaculty of thinking in the several parts of it; as well as, afterwards,\nby compounding those ideas, and reflecting on its own operations, it\nincreases its stock, as well as facility in remembering, imagining,\nreasoning, and other modes of thinking.\n21. State of a child in the mother\u2019s womb.\nHe that will suffer himself to be informed by observation and\nexperience, and not make his own hypothesis the rule of nature, will\nfind few signs of a soul accustomed to much thinking in a new-born\nchild, and much fewer of any reasoning at all. And yet it is hard to\nimagine that the rational soul should think so much, and not reason at\nall. And he that will consider that infants newly come into the world\nspend the greatest part of their time in sleep, and are seldom awake\nbut when either hunger calls for the teat, or some pain (the most\nimportunate of all sensations), or some other violent impression on the\nbody, forces the mind to perceive and attend to it;\u2014he, I say, who\nconsiders this, will perhaps find reason to imagine that a F\u0153tus in the\nmother\u2019s womb differs not much from the state of a vegetable, but\npasses the greatest part of its time without perception or thought;\ndoing very little but sleep in a place where it needs not seek for\nfood, and is surrounded with liquor, always equally soft, and near of\nthe same temper; where the eyes have no light, and the ears so shut up\nare not very susceptible of sounds; and where there is little or no\nvariety, or change of objects, to move the senses.\n22. The mind thinks in proportion to the matter it gets from experience\nto think about.\nFollow a child from its birth, and observe the alterations that time\nmakes, and you shall find, as the mind by the senses comes more and\nmore to be furnished with ideas, it comes to be more and more awake;\nthinks more, the more it has matter to think on. After some time it\nbegins to know the objects which, being most familiar with it, have\nmade lasting impressions. Thus it comes by degrees to know the persons\nit daily converses with, and distinguishes them from strangers; which\nare instances and effects of its coming to retain and distinguish the\nideas the senses convey to it. And so we may observe how the mind, BY\nDEGREES, improves in these; and ADVANCES to the exercise of those other\nfaculties of enlarging, compounding, and abstracting its ideas, and of\nreasoning about them, and reflecting upon all these; of which I shall\nhave occasion to speak more hereafter.\n23. A man begins to have ideas when he first has sensation. What\nsensation is.\nIf it shall be demanded then, WHEN a man BEGINS to have any ideas, I\nthink the true answer is,\u2014WHEN HE FIRST HAS ANY SENSATION. For, since\nthere appear not to be any ideas in the mind before the senses have\nconveyed any in, I conceive that ideas in the understanding are coeval\nwith SENSATION; WHICH IS SUCH AN IMPRESSION OR MOTION MADE IN SOME PART\nOF THE BODY, AS MAKES IT BE TAKEN NOTICE OF IN THE UNDERSTANDING.\n24. The Original of all our Knowledge.\nThe impressions then that are made on our sense by outward objects that\nare extrinsical to the mind; and its own operations about these\nimpressions, reflected on by itself, as proper objects to be\ncontemplated by it, are, I conceive, the original of all knowledge.\nThus the first capacity of human intellect is,\u2014that the mind is fitted\nto receive the impressions made on it; either through the senses by\noutward objects, or by its own operations when it reflects on them.\nThis is the first step a man makes towards the discovery of anything,\nand the groundwork whereon to build all those notions which ever he\nshall have naturally in this world. All those sublime thoughts which\ntower above the clouds, and reach as high as heaven itself, take their\nrise and footing here: in all that great extent wherein the mind\nwanders, in those remote speculations it may seem to be elevated with,\nit stirs not one jot beyond those ideas which SENSE or REFLECTION have\noffered for its contemplation.\n25. In the Reception of simple Ideas, the Understanding is for the most\npart passive.\nIn this part the understanding is merely passive; and whether or no it\nwill have these beginnings, and as it were materials of knowledge, is\nnot in its own power. For the objects of our senses do, many of them,\nobtrude their particular ideas upon our minds whether we will or not;\nand the operations of our minds will not let us be without, at least,\nsome obscure notions of them. No man can be wholly ignorant of what he\ndoes when he thinks. These simple ideas, when offered to the mind, the\nunderstanding can no more refuse to have, nor alter when they are\nimprinted, nor blot them out and make new ones itself, than a mirror\ncan refuse, alter, or obliterate the images or ideas which the objects\nset before it do therein produce. As the bodies that surround us do\ndiversely affect our organs, the mind is forced to receive the\nimpressions; and cannot avoid the perception of those ideas that are\nannexed to them.\nCHAPTER II.\nOF SIMPLE IDEAS.\n1. Uncompounded Appearances.\nThe better to understand the nature, manner, and extent of our\nknowledge, one thing is carefully to be observed concerning the ideas\nwe have; and that is, that some of them, are SIMPLE and some COMPLEX.\nThough the qualities that affect our senses are, in the things\nthemselves, so united and blended, that there is no separation, no\ndistance between them; yet it is plain, the ideas they produce in the\nmind enter by the senses simple; and unmixed. For, though the sight and\ntouch often take in from the same object, at the same time, different\nideas;\u2014as a man sees at once motion and colour; the hand feels softness\nand warmth in the same piece of wax: yet the simple ideas thus united\nin the same subject, are as perfectly distinct as those that come in by\ndifferent senses. The coldness and hardness which a man feels in a\npiece of ice being as distinct ideas in the mind as the smell and\nwhiteness of a lily; or as the taste of sugar, and smell of a rose. And\nthere is nothing can be plainer to a man than the clear and distinct\nperception he has of those simple ideas; which, being each in itself\nuncompounded, contains in it nothing but ONE UNIFORM APPEARANCE, OR\nCONCEPTION IN THE MIND, and is not distinguishable into different\nideas.\n2. The Mind can neither make nor destroy them.\nThese simple ideas, the materials of all our knowledge, are suggested\nand furnished to the mind only by those two ways above mentioned, viz.\nsensation and reflection. When the understanding is once stored with\nthese simple ideas, it has the power to repeat, compare, and unite\nthem, even to an almost infinite variety, and so can make at pleasure\nnew complex ideas. But it is not in the power of the most exalted wit,\nor enlarged understanding, by any quickness or variety of thought, to\nINVENT or FRAME one new simple idea in the mind, not taken in by the\nways before mentioned: nor can any force of the understanding DESTROY\nthose that are there. The dominion of man, in this little world of his\nown understanding being much what the same as it is in the great world\nof visible things; wherein his power, however managed by art and skill,\nreaches no farther than to compound and divide the materials that are\nmade to his hand; but can do nothing towards the making the least\nparticle of new matter, or destroying one atom of what is already in\nbeing. The same inability will every one find in himself, who shall go\nabout to fashion in his understanding one simple idea, not received in\nby his senses from external objects, or by reflection from the\noperations of his own mind about them. I would have any one try to\nfancy any taste which had never affected his palate; or frame the idea\nof a scent he had never smelt: and when he can do this, I will also\nconclude that a blind man hath ideas of colours, and a deaf man true\ndistinct notions of sounds.\n3. Only the qualities that affect the senses are imaginable.\nThis is the reason why\u2014though we cannot believe it impossible to God to\nmake a creature with other organs, and more ways to convey into the\nunderstanding the notice of corporeal things than those five, as they\nare usually counted, which he has given to man\u2014yet I think it is not\npossible for any MAN to imagine any other qualities in bodies,\nhowsoever constituted, whereby they can be taken notice of, besides\nsounds, tastes, smells, visible and tangible qualities. And had mankind\nbeen made but with four senses, the qualities then which are the\nobjects of the fifth sense had been as far from our notice,\nimagination, and conception, as now any belonging to a sixth, seventh,\nor eighth sense can possibly be;\u2014which, whether yet some other\ncreatures, in some other parts of this vast and stupendous universe,\nmay not have, will be a great presumption to deny. He that will not set\nhimself proudly at the top of all things, but will consider the\nimmensity of this fabric, and the great variety that is to be found in\nthis little and inconsiderable part of it which he has to do with, may\nbe apt to think that, in other mansions of it, there may be other and\ndifferent intelligent beings, of whose faculties he has as little\nknowledge or apprehension as a worm shut up in one drawer of a cabinet\nhath of the senses or understanding of a man; such variety and\nexcellency being suitable to the wisdom and power of the Maker. I have\nhere followed the common opinion of man\u2019s having but five senses;\nthough, perhaps, there may be justly counted more;\u2014but either\nsupposition serves equally to my present purpose.\nCHAPTER III.\nOF SIMPLE IDEAS OF SENSE.\n1. Division of simple ideas.\nThe better to conceive the ideas we receive from sensation, it may not\nbe amiss for us to consider them, in reference to the different ways\nwhereby they make their approaches to our minds, and make themselves\nperceivable by us.\nFIRST, then, There are some which come into our minds BY ONE SENSE\nONLY.\nSECONDLY, There are others that convey themselves into the mind BY MORE\nSENSES THAN ONE.\nTHIRDLY, Others that are had from REFLECTION ONLY.\nFOURTHLY, There are some that make themselves way, and are suggested to\nthe mind BY ALL THE WAYS OF SENSATION AND REFLECTION.\nWe shall consider them apart under these several heads.\nIdeas of one Sense.\nThere are some ideas which have admittance only through one sense,\nwhich is peculiarly adapted to receive them. Thus light and colours, as\nwhite, red, yellow, blue; with their several degrees or shades and\nmixtures, as green, scarlet, purple, sea-green, and the rest, come in\nonly by the eyes. All kinds of noises, sounds, and tones, only by the\nears. The several tastes and smells, by the nose and palate. And if\nthese organs, or the nerves which are the conduits to convey them from\nwithout to their audience in the brain,\u2014the mind\u2019s presence-room (as I\nmay so call it)\u2014are any of them so disordered as not to perform their\nfunctions, they have no postern to be admitted by; no other way to\nbring themselves into view, and be perceived by the understanding.\nThe most considerable of those belonging to the touch, are heat and\ncold, and solidity: all the rest, consisting almost wholly in the\nsensible configuration, as smooth and rough; or else, more or less firm\nadhesion of the parts, as hard and soft, tough and brittle, are obvious\nenough.\n2. Few simple Ideas have Names.\nI think it will be needless to enumerate all the particular simple\nideas belonging to each sense. Nor indeed is it possible if we would;\nthere being a great many more of them belonging to most of the senses\nthan we have names for. The variety of smells, which are as many\nalmost, if not more, than species of bodies in the world, do most of\nthem want names. Sweet and stinking commonly serve our turn for these\nideas, which in effect is little more than to call them pleasing or\ndispleasing; though the smell of a rose and violet, both sweet, are\ncertainly very distinct ideas. Nor are the different tastes, that by\nour palates we receive ideas of, much better provided with names.\nSweet, bitter, sour, harsh, and salt are almost all the epithets we\nhave to denominate that numberless variety of relishes, which are to be\nfound distinct, not only in almost every sort of creatures, but in the\ndifferent parts of the same plant, fruit, or animal. The same may be\nsaid of colours and sounds. I shall, therefore, in the account of\nsimple ideas I am here giving, content myself to set down only such as\nare most material to our present purpose, or are in themselves less apt\nto be taken notice of though they are very frequently the ingredients\nof our complex ideas; amongst which, I think, I may well account\nsolidity, which therefore I shall treat of in the next chapter.\nCHAPTER IV.\nIDEA OF SOLIDITY.\n1. We receive this Idea from Touch.\nThe idea of SOLIDITY we receive by our touch: and it arises from the\nresistance which we find in body to the entrance of any other body into\nthe place it possesses, till it has left it. There is no idea which we\nreceive more constantly from sensation than solidity. Whether we move\nor rest, in what posture soever we are, we always feel something under\nus that supports us, and hinders our further sinking downwards; and the\nbodies which we daily handle make us perceive that, whilst they remain\nbetween them, they do, by an insurmountable force, hinder the approach\nof the parts of our hands that press them. THAT WHICH THUS HINDERS THE\nAPPROACH OF TWO BODIES, WHEN THEY ARE MOVED ONE TOWARDS ANOTHER, I CALL\nSOLIDITY. I will not dispute whether this acceptation of the word solid\nbe nearer to its original signification than that which mathematicians\nuse it in. It suffices that I think the common notion of solidity will\nallow, if not justify, this use of it; but if any one think it better\nto call it IMPENETRABILITY, he has my consent. Only I have thought the\nterm solidity the more proper to express this idea, not only because of\nits vulgar use in that sense, but also because it carries something\nmore of positive in it than impenetrability; which is negative, and is\nperhaps more a consequence of solidity, than solidity itself. This, of\nall other, seems the idea most intimately connected with, and essential\nto body; so as nowhere else to be found or imagined, but only in\nmatter. And though our senses take no notice of it, but in masses of\nmatter, of a bulk sufficient to cause a sensation in us: yet the mind,\nhaving once got this idea from such grosser sensible bodies, traces it\nfurther, and considers it, as well as figure, in the minutest particle\nof matter that can exist; and finds it inseparably inherent in body,\nwherever or however modified.\n2. Solidity fills Space.\nThis is the idea which belongs to body, whereby we conceive it to fill\nspace. The idea of which filling of space is,\u2014that where we imagine any\nspace taken up by a solid substance, we conceive it so to possess it,\nthat it excludes all other solid substances; and will for ever hinder\nany other two bodies, that move towards one another in a straight line,\nfrom coming to touch one another, unless it removes from between them\nin a line not parallel to that which they move in. This idea of it, the\nbodies which we ordinarily handle sufficiently furnish us with.\n3. Distinct from Space.\nThis resistance, whereby it keeps other bodies out of the space which\nit possesses, is so great, that no force, how great soever, can\nsurmount it. All the bodies in the world, pressing a drop of water on\nall sides, will never be able to overcome the resistance which it will\nmake, soft as it is, to their approaching one another, till it be\nremoved out of their way: whereby our idea of solidity is distinguished\nboth from pure space, which is capable neither of resistance nor\nmotion; and from the ordinary idea of hardness. For a man may conceive\ntwo bodies at a distance, so as they may approach one another, without\ntouching or displacing any solid thing, till their superficies come to\nmeet; whereby, I think, we have the clear idea of space without\nsolidity. For (not to go so far as annihilation of any particular body)\nI ask, whether a man cannot have the idea of the motion of one single\nbody alone, without any other succeeding immediately into its place? I\nthink it is evident he can: the idea of motion in one body no more\nincluding the idea of motion in another, than the idea of a square\nfigure in one body includes the idea of a square figure in another. I\ndo not ask, whether bodies do so EXIST, that the motion of one body\ncannot really be without the motion of another. To determine this\neither way, is to beg the question for or against a VACUUM. But my\nquestion is,\u2014whether one cannot have the IDEA of one body moved, whilst\nothers are at rest? And I think this no one will deny. If so, then the\nplace it deserted gives us the idea of pure space without solidity;\nwhereinto any other body may enter, without either resistance or\nprotrusion of anything. When the sucker in a pump is drawn, the space\nit filled in the tube is certainly the same whether any other body\nfollows the motion of the sucker or not: nor does it imply a\ncontradiction that, upon the motion of one body, another that is only\ncontiguous to it should not follow it. The necessity of such a motion\nis built only on the supposition that the world is full; but not on the\ndistinct IDEAS of space and solidity, which are as different as\nresistance and not resistance, protrusion and not protrusion. And that\nmen have ideas of space without a body, their very disputes about a\nvacuum plainly demonstrate, as is shown in another place.\n4. From Hardness.\nSolidity is hereby also differenced from hardness, in that solidity\nconsists in repletion, and so an utter exclusion of other bodies out of\nthe space it possesses: but hardness, in a firm cohesion of the parts\nof matter, making up masses of a sensible bulk, so that the whole does\nnot easily change its figure. And indeed, hard and soft are names that\nwe give to things only in relation to the constitutions of our own\nbodies; that being generally called hard by us, which will put us to\npain sooner than change figure by the pressure of any part of our\nbodies; and that, on the contrary, soft, which changes the situation of\nits parts upon an easy and unpainful touch.\nBut this difficulty of changing the situation of the sensible parts\namongst themselves, or of the figure of the whole, gives no more\nsolidity to the hardest body in the world than to the softest; nor is\nan adamant one jot more solid than water. For, though the two flat\nsides of two pieces of marble will more easily approach each other,\nbetween which there is nothing but water or air, than if there be a\ndiamond between them; yet it is not that the parts of the diamond are\nmore solid than those of water, or resist more; but because the parts\nof water, being more easily separable from each other, they will, by a\nside motion, be more easily removed, and give way to the approach of\nthe two pieces of marble. But if they could be kept from making place\nby that side motion, they would eternally hinder the approach of these\ntwo pieces of marble, as much as the diamond; and it would be as\nimpossible by any force to surmount their resistance, as to surmount\nthe resistance of the parts of a diamond. The softest body in the world\nwill as invincibly resist the coming together of any other two bodies,\nif it be not put out of the way, but remain between them, as the\nhardest that can be found or imagined. He that shall fill a yielding\nsoft body well with air or water, will quickly find its resistance. And\nhe that thinks that nothing but bodies that are hard can keep his hands\nfrom approaching one another, may be pleased to make a trial, with the\nair inclosed in a football. The experiment, I have been told, was made\nat Florence, with a hollow globe of gold filled with water, and exactly\nclosed; which further shows the solidity of so soft a body as water.\nFor the golden globe thus filled, being put into a press, which was\ndriven by the extreme force of screws, the water made itself way\nthrough the pores of that very close metal, and finding no room for a\nnearer approach of its particles within, got to the outside, where it\nrose like a dew, and so fell in drops, before the sides of the globe\ncould be made to yield to the violent compression of the engine that\nsqueezed it.\n5. On Solidity depend Impulse, Resistance and Protrusion.\nBy this idea of solidity is the extension of body distinguished from\nthe extension of space:\u2014the extension of body being nothing but the\ncohesion or continuity of solid, separable, movable parts; and the\nextension of space, the continuity of unsolid, inseparable, and\nimmovable parts. Upon the solidity of bodies also depend their mutual\nimpulse, resistance, and protrusion. Of pure space then, and solidity,\nthere are several (amongst which I confess myself one) who persuade\nthemselves they have clear and distinct ideas; and that they can think\non space, without anything in it that resists or is protruded by body.\nThis is the idea of pure space, which they think they have as clear as\nany idea they can have of the extension of body: the idea of the\ndistance between the opposite parts of a concave superficies being\nequally as clear without as with the idea of any solid parts between:\nand on the other side, they persuade themselves that they have,\ndistinct from that of pure space, the idea of SOMETHING THAT FILLS\nSPACE, that can be protruded by the impulse of other bodies, or resist\ntheir motion. If there be others that have not these two ideas\ndistinct, but confound them, and make but one of them, I know not how\nmen, who have the same idea under different names, or different ideas\nunder the same name, can in that case talk with one another; any more\nthan a man who, not being blind or deaf, has distinct ideas of the\ncolour of scarlet and the sound of a trumpet, could discourse\nconcerning scarlet colour with the blind man I mentioned in another\nplace, who fancied that the idea of scarlet was like the sound of a\ntrumpet.\n6. What Solidity is.\nIf any one asks me, WHAT THIS SOLIDITY IS, I send him to his senses to\ninform him. Let him put a flint or a football between his hands, and\nthen endeavour to join them, and he will know. If he thinks this not a\nsufficient explication of solidity, what it is, and wherein it\nconsists; I promise to tell him what it is, and wherein it consists,\nwhen he tells me what thinking is, or wherein it consists; or explains\nto me what extension or motion is, which perhaps seems much easier. The\nsimple ideas we have, are such as experience teaches them us; but if,\nbeyond that, we endeavour by words to make them clearer in the mind, we\nshall succeed no better than if we went about to clear up the darkness\nof a blind man\u2019s mind by talking; and to discourse into him the ideas\nof light and colours. The reason of this I shall show in another place.\nCHAPTER V.\nOF SIMPLE IDEAS OF DIVERS SENSES.\nIdeas received both by seeing and touching.\nThe ideas we get by more than one sense are, of SPACE or EXTENSION,\nFIGURE, REST, and MOTION. For these make perceivable impressions, both\non the eyes and touch; and we can receive and convey into our minds the\nideas of the extension, figure, motion, and rest of bodies, both by\nseeing and feeling. But having occasion to speak more at large of these\nin another place, I here only enumerate them.\nCHAPTER VI.\nOF SIMPLE IDEAS OF REFLECTION.\nSimple Ideas are the Operations of Mind about its other Ideas.\nThe mind receiving the ideas mentioned in the foregoing chapters from\nwithout, when it turns its view inward upon itself, and observes its\nown actions about those ideas it has, takes from thence other ideas,\nwhich are as capable to be the objects of its contemplation as any of\nthose it received from foreign things.\nThe Idea of Perception, and Idea of Willing, we have from Reflection.\nThe two great and principal actions of the mind, which are most\nfrequently considered, and which are so frequent that every one that\npleases may take notice of them in himself, are these two:\u2014\nPERCEPTION, or THINKING; and VOLITION, or WILLING.\nThe power of thinking is called the UNDERSTANDING, and the power of\nvolition is called the WILL; and these two powers or abilities in the\nmind are denominated faculties.\nOf some of the MODES of these simple ideas of reflection, such as are\nREMEMBRANCE, DISCERNING, REASONING, JUDGING, KNOWLEDGE, FAITH, &c., I\nshall have occasion to speak hereafter.\nCHAPTER VII.\nOF SIMPLE IDEAS OF BOTH SENSATION AND REFLECTION.\n1. Ideas of Pleasure and Pain.\nThere be other simple ideas which convey themselves into the mind by\nall the ways of sensation and reflection, _viz_.\n_Pleasure_ or _Delight_, and its opposite,\n_Pain_, or _Uneasiness;_\n_Power;_\n_Existence;_\n_Unity_ mix with almost all our other Ideas.\n2. Delight or uneasiness, one or other of them, join themselves to\nalmost all our ideas both of sensation and reflection: and there is\nscarce any affection of our senses from without, any retired thought of\nour mind within, which is not able to produce in us pleasure or pain.\nBy pleasure and pain, I would be understood to signify, whatsoever\ndelights or molests us; whether it arises from the thoughts of our\nminds, or anything operating on our bodies. For, whether we call it;\nsatisfaction, delight, pleasure, happiness, &c., on the one side, or\nuneasiness, trouble, pain, torment, anguish, misery, &c., the other,\nthey are still but different degrees of the same thing, and belong to\nthe ideas of pleasure and pain, delight or uneasiness; which are the\nnames I shall most commonly use for those two sorts of ideas.\n3. As motives of our actions.\nThe infinite wise Author of our being, having given us the power over\nseveral parts of our bodies, to move or keep them at rest as we think\nfit; and also, by the motion of them, to move ourselves and other\ncontiguous bodies, in which consist all the actions of our body: having\nalso given a power to our minds, in several instances, to choose,\namongst its ideas, which it will think on, and to pursue the inquiry of\nthis or that subject with consideration and attention, to excite us to\nthese actions of thinking and motion that we are capable of,\u2014has been\npleased to join to several thoughts, and several sensations a\nperception of delight. If this were wholly separated from all our\noutward sensations, and inward thoughts, we should have no reason to\nprefer one thought or action to another; negligence to attention, or\nmotion to rest. And so we should neither stir our bodies, nor employ\nour minds, but let our thoughts (if I may so call it) run adrift,\nwithout any direction or design, and suffer the ideas of our minds,\nlike unregarded shadows, to make their appearances there, as it\nhappened, without attending to them. In which state man, however\nfurnished with the faculties of understanding and will, would be a very\nidle, inactive creature, and pass his time only in a lazy, lethargic\ndream. It has therefore pleased our wise Creator to annex to several\nobjects, and the ideas which we receive from them, as also to several\nof our thoughts, a concomitant pleasure, and that in several objects,\nto several degrees, that those faculties which he had endowed us with\nmight not remain wholly idle and unemployed by us.\n4. An end and use of pain.\nPain has the same efficacy and use to set us on work that pleasure has,\nwe being as ready to employ our faculties to avoid that, as to pursue\nthis: only this is worth our consideration, that pain is often produced\nby the same objects and ideas that produce pleasure in us. This their\nnear conjunction, which makes us often feel pain in the sensations\nwhere we expected pleasure, gives us new occasion of admiring the\nwisdom and goodness of our Maker, who, designing the preservation of\nour being, has annexed pain to the application of many things to our\nbodies, to warn us of the harm that they will do, and as advices to\nwithdraw from them. But he, not designing our preservation barely, but\nthe preservation of every part and organ in its perfection, hath in\nmany cases annexed pain to those very ideas which delight us. Thus\nheat, that is very agreeable to us in one degree, by a little greater\nincrease of it proves no ordinary torment: and the most pleasant of all\nsensible objects, light itself, if there be too much of it, if\nincreased beyond a due proportion to our eyes, causes a very painful\nsensation. Which is wisely and favourably so ordered by nature, that\nwhen any object does, by the vehemency of its operation, disorder the\ninstruments of sensation, whose structures cannot but be very nice and\ndelicate, we might, by the pain, be warned to withdraw, before the\norgan be quite put out of order, and so be unfitted for its proper\nfunction for the future. The consideration of those objects that\nproduce it may well persuade us, that this is the end or use of pain.\nFor, though great light be insufferable to our eyes, yet the highest\ndegree of darkness does not at all disease them: because that, causing\nno disorderly motion in it, leaves that curious organ unharmed in its\nnatural state. But yet excess of cold as well as heat pains us: because\nit is equally destructive to that temper which is necessary to the\npreservation of life, and the exercise of the several functions of the\nbody, and which consists in a moderate degree of warmth; or, if you\nplease, a motion of the insensible parts of our bodies, confined within\ncertain bounds.\n5. Another end.\nBeyond all this, we may find another reason why God hath scattered up\nand down several degrees of pleasure and pain, in all the things that\nenviron and affect us; and blended them together in almost all that our\nthoughts and senses have to do with;\u2014that we, finding imperfection,\ndissatisfaction, and want of complete happiness, in all the enjoyments\nwhich the creatures can afford us, might be led to seek it in the\nenjoyment of Him with whom there is fullness of joy, and at whose right\nhand are pleasures for evermore.\n6. Goodness of God in annexing pleasure and pain to our other ideas.\nThough what I have here said may not, perhaps, make the ideas of\npleasure and pain clearer to us than our own experience does, which is\nthe only way that we are capable of having them; yet the consideration\nof the reason why they are annexed to so many other ideas, serving to\ngive us due sentiments of the wisdom and goodness of the Sovereign\nDisposer of all things, may not be unsuitable to the main end of these\ninquiries: the knowledge and veneration of him being the chief end of\nall our thoughts, and the proper business of all understandings.\n7. Ideas of Existence and Unity.\nEXISTENCE and UNITY are two other ideas that are suggested to the\nunderstanding by every object without, and every idea within. When\nideas are in our minds, we consider them as being actually there, as\nwell as we consider things to be actually without us;\u2014which is, that\nthey exist, or have existence. And whatever we can consider as one\nthing, whether a real being or idea, suggests to the understanding the\nidea of unity.\n8. Idea of Power.\nPOWER also is another of those simple ideas which we receive from\nsensation and reflection. For, observing in ourselves that we do and\ncan think, and that we can at pleasure move several parts of our bodies\nwhich were at rest; the effects, also, that natural bodies are able to\nproduce in one another, occurring every moment to our senses,\u2014we both\nthese ways get the idea of power.\n9. Idea of Succession.\nBesides these there is another idea, which, though suggested by our\nsenses, yet is more constantly offered to us by what passes in our\nminds; and that is the idea of SUCCESSION. For if we look immediately\ninto ourselves, and reflect on what is observable there, we shall find\nour ideas always, whilst we are awake, or have any thought, passing in\ntrain, one going and another coming, without intermission.\n10. Simple Ideas the materials of all our Knowledge.\nThese, if they are not all, are at least (as I think) the most\nconsiderable of those simple ideas which the mind has, out of which is\nmade all its other knowledge; all which it receives only by the two\nforementioned ways of sensation and reflection.\nNor let any one think these too narrow bounds for the capacious mind of\nman to expatiate in, which takes its flight further than the stars, and\ncannot be confined by the limits of the world; that extends its\nthoughts often even beyond the utmost expansion of Matter, and makes\nexcursions into that incomprehensible Inane. I grant all this, but\ndesire any one to assign any SIMPLE IDEA which is not received from one\nof those inlets before mentioned, or any COMPLEX IDEA not made out of\nthose simple ones. Nor will it be so strange to think these few simple\nideas sufficient to employ the quickest thought, or largest capacity;\nand to furnish the materials of all that various knowledge, and more\nvarious fancies and opinions of all mankind, if we consider how many\nwords may be made out of the various composition of twenty-four\nletters; or if, going one step further, we will but reflect on the\nvariety of combinations that may be made with barely one of the\nabove-mentioned ideas, viz. number, whose stock is inexhaustible and\ntruly infinite: and what a large and immense field doth extension alone\nafford the mathematicians?\nCHAPTER VIII.\nSOME FURTHER CONSIDERATIONS CONCERNING OUR SIMPLE IDEAS OF SENSATION.\n1. Positive Ideas from privative causes.\nConcerning the simple ideas of Sensation; it is to be considered,\u2014that\nwhatsoever is so constituted in nature as to be able, by affecting our\nsenses, to cause any perception in the mind, doth thereby produce in\nthe understanding a simple idea; which, whatever be the external cause\nof it, when it comes to be taken notice of by our discerning faculty,\nit is by the mind looked on and considered there to be a real positive\nidea in the understanding, as much as any other whatsoever; though,\nperhaps, the cause of it be but a privation of the subject.\n2. Ideas in the mind distinguished from that in things which gives rise\nto them.\nThus the ideas of heat and cold, light and darkness, white and black,\nmotion and rest, are equally clear and positive ideas in the mind;\nthough, perhaps, some of the causes which produce them are barely\nprivations, in those subjects from whence our senses derive those\nideas. These the understanding, in its view of them, considers all as\ndistinct positive ideas, without taking notice of the causes that\nproduce them: which is an inquiry not belonging to the idea, as it is\nin the understanding, but to the nature of the things existing without\nus. These are two very different things, and carefully to be\ndistinguished; it being one thing to perceive and know the idea of\nwhite or black, and quite another to examine what kind of particles\nthey must be, and how ranged in the superficies, to make any object\nappear white or black.\n3. We may have the ideas when we are ignorant of their physical causes.\nA painter or dyer who never inquired into their causes hath the ideas\nof white and black, and other colours, as clearly, perfectly, and\ndistinctly in his understanding, and perhaps more distinctly, than the\nphilosopher who hath busied himself in considering their natures, and\nthinks he knows how far either of them is, in its cause, positive or\nprivative; and the idea of black is no less positive in his mind than\nthat of white, however the cause of that colour in the external object\nmay be only a privation.\n4. Why a privative cause in nature may occasion a positive idea.\nIf it were the design of my present undertaking to inquire into the\nnatural causes and manner of perception, I should offer this as a\nreason why a privative cause might, in some cases at least, produce a\npositive idea; viz. that all sensation being produced in us only by\ndifferent degrees and modes of motion in our animal spirits, variously\nagitated by external objects, the abatement of any former motion must\nas necessarily produce a new sensation as the variation or increase of\nit; and so introduce a new idea, which depends only on a different\nmotion of the animal spirits in that organ.\n5. Negative names need not be meaningless.\nBut whether this be so or not I will not here determine, but appeal to\nevery one\u2019s own experience, whether the shadow of a man, though it\nconsists of nothing but the absence of light (and the more the absence\nof light is, the more discernible is the shadow) does not, when a man\nlooks on it, cause as clear and positive idea in his mind, as a man\nhimself, though covered over with clear sunshine? And the picture of a\nshadow is a positive thing. Indeed, we have negative names, to which\nthere be no positive ideas; but they consist wholly in negation of some\ncertain ideas, as SILENCE, INVISIBLE; but these signify not any ideas\nin the mind but their absence.\n6. Whether any ideas are due to causes really private.\nAnd thus one may truly be said to see darkness. For, supposing a hole\nperfectly dark, from whence no light is reflected, it is certain one\nmay see the figure of it, or it may be painted; or whether the ink I\nwrite with makes any other idea, is a question. The privative causes I\nhave here assigned of positive ideas are according to the common\nopinion; but, in truth, it will be hard to determine whether there be\nreally any ideas from a privative cause, till it be determined, whether\nrest be any more a privation than motion.\n7. Ideas in the Mind, Qualities in Bodies.\nTo discover the nature of our IDEAS the better, and to discourse of\nthem intelligibly, it will be convenient to distinguish them AS THEY\nARE IDEAS OR PERCEPTIONS IN OUR MINDS; and AS THEY ARE MODIFICATIONS OF\nMATTER IN THE BODIES THAT CAUSE SUCH PERCEPTIONS IN US: that so we may\nnot think (as perhaps usually is done) that they are exactly the images\nand resemblances of something inherent in the subject; most of those of\nsensation being in the mind no more the likeness of something existing\nwithout us, than the names that stand for them are the likeness of our\nideas, which yet upon hearing they are apt to excite in us.\n8. Our Ideas and the Qualities of Bodies.\nWhatsoever the mind perceives IN ITSELF, or is the immediate object of\nperception, thought, or understanding, that I call IDEA; and the power\nto produce any idea in our mind, I call QUALITY of the subject wherein\nthat power is. Thus a snowball having the power to produce in us the\nideas of white, cold, and round,\u2014the power to produce those ideas in\nus, as they are in the snowball, I call qualities; and as they are\nsensations or perceptions in our understandings, I call them ideas;\nwhich IDEAS, if I speak of sometimes as in the things themselves, I\nwould be understood to mean those qualities in the objects which\nproduce them in us.\n9. Primary Qualities of Bodies.\nConcerning these qualities, we, I think, observe these primary ones in\nbodies that produce simple ideas in us, viz. SOLIDITY, EXTENSION,\nMOTION or REST, NUMBER or FIGURE. These, which I call ORIGINAL or\nPRIMARY qualities of body, are wholly inseparable from it; and such as\nin all the alterations and changes it suffers, all the force can be\nused upon it, it constantly keeps; and such as sense constantly finds\nin every particle of matter which has bulk enough to be perceived; and\nthe mind finds inseparable from every particle of matter, though less\nthan to make itself singly be perceived by our senses: v.g. Take a\ngrain of wheat, divide it into two parts; each part has still solidity,\nextension, figure, and mobility: divide it again, and it retains still\nthe same qualities; and so divide it on, till the parts become\ninsensible; they must retain still each of them all those qualities.\nFor division (which is all that a mill, or pestle, or any other body,\ndoes upon another, in reducing it to insensible parts) can never take\naway either solidity, extension, figure, or mobility from any body, but\nonly makes two or more distinct separate masses of matter, of that\nwhich was but one before; all which distinct masses, reckoned as so\nmany distinct bodies, after division, make a certain number.\n10. [not in early editions]\n11. How Bodies produce Ideas in us.\nThe next thing to be considered is, how bodies operate one upon\nanother; and that is manifestly by impulse, and nothing else. It being\nimpossible to conceive that body should operate on WHAT IT DOES NOT\nTOUCH (which is all one as to imagine it can operate where it is not),\nor when it does touch, operate any other way than by motion.\n12. By motions, external, and in our organism.\nIf then external objects be not united to our minds when they produce\nideas therein; and yet we perceive these ORIGINAL qualities in such of\nthem as singly fall under our senses, it is evident that some motion\nmust be thence continued by our nerves, or animal spirits, by some\nparts of our bodies, to the brains or the seat of sensation, there to\nproduce in our minds the particular ideas we have of them. And since\nthe extension, figure, number, and motion of bodies of an observable\nbigness, may be perceived at a distance by the sight, it is evident\nsome singly imperceptible bodies must come from them; to the eyes, and\nthereby convey to the brain some motion; which produces these ideas\nwhich we have of them in us.\n13. How secondary Qualities produce their ideas.\nAfter the same manner that the ideas of these original qualities are\nproduced in us, we may conceive that the ideas of SECONDARY qualities\nare also produced, viz. by the operation of insensible particles on our\nsenses. For, it being manifest that there are bodies and good store of\nbodies, each whereof are so small, that we cannot by any of our senses\ndiscover either their bulk, figure, or motion,\u2014as is evident in the\nparticles of the air and water, and others extremely smaller than\nthose; perhaps as much smaller than the particles of air and water, as\nthe particles of air and water are smaller than peas or\nhail-stones;\u2014let us suppose at present that, the different motions and\nfigures, bulk and number, of such particles, affecting the several\norgans of our senses, produce in us those different sensations which we\nhave from the colours and smells of bodies; v.g. that a violet, by the\nimpulse of such insensible particles of matter, of peculiar figures and\nbulks, and in different degrees and modifications of their motions,\ncauses the ideas of the blue colour, and sweet scent of that flower to\nbe produced in our minds. It being no more impossible to conceive that\nGod should annex such ideas to such motions, with which they have no\nsimilitude, than that he should annex the idea of pain to the motion of\na piece of steel dividing our flesh, with which that idea hath no\nresemblance.\n14. They depend on the primary Qualities.\nWhat I have said concerning colours and smells may be understood also\nof tastes and sounds, and other the like sensible qualities; which,\nwhatever reality we by mistake attribute to them, are in truth nothing\nin the objects themselves, but powers to produce various sensations in\nus; and depend on those primary qualities, viz. bulk, figure, texture,\nand motion of parts and therefore I call them SECONDARY QUALITIES.\n15. Ideas of primary Qualities are Resemblances; of secondary, not.\nFrom whence I think it easy to draw this observation,\u2014that the ideas of\nprimary qualities of bodies are resemblances of them, and their\npatterns do really exist in the bodies themselves, but the ideas\nproduced in us by these secondary qualities have no resemblance of them\nat all. There is nothing like our ideas, existing in the bodies\nthemselves. They are, in the bodies we denominate from them, only a\npower to produce those sensations in us: and what is sweet, blue, or\nwarm in idea, is but the certain bulk, figure, and motion of the\ninsensible parts, in the bodies themselves, which we call so.\n16. Examples.\nFlame is denominated hot and light; snow, white and cold; and manna,\nwhite and sweet, from the ideas they produce in us. Which qualities are\ncommonly thought to be the same in those bodies that those ideas are in\nus, the one the perfect resemblance of the other, as they are in a\nmirror, and it would by most men be judged very extravagant if one\nshould say otherwise. And yet he that will consider that the same fire\nthat, at one distance produces in us the sensation of warmth, does, at\na nearer approach, produce in us the far different sensation of pain,\nought to bethink himself what reason he has to say\u2014that this idea of\nwarmth, which was produced in him by the fire, is ACTUALLY IN THE FIRE;\nand his idea of pain, which the same fire produced in him the same way,\nis NOT in the fire. Why are whiteness and coldness in snow, and pain\nnot, when it produces the one and the other idea in us; and can do\nneither, but by the bulk, figure, number, and motion of its solid\nparts?\n17. The ideas of the Primary alone really exist.\nThe particular bulk, number, figure, and motion of the parts of fire or\nsnow are really in them,\u2014whether any one\u2019s senses perceive them or no:\nand therefore they may be called REAL qualities, because they really\nexist in those bodies. But light, heat, whiteness, or coldness, are no\nmore really in them than sickness or pain is in manna. Take away the\nsensation of them; let not the eyes see light or colours, nor the ear\nhear sounds; let the palate not taste, nor the nose smell, and all\ncolours, tastes, odours, and sounds, AS THEY ARE SUCH PARTICULAR IDEAS,\nvanish and cease, and are reduced to their causes, i.e. bulk, figure,\nand motion of parts.\n18. The secondary exist in things only as modes of the primary.\nA piece of manna of a sensible bulk is able to produce in us the idea\nof a round or square figure; and by being removed from one place to\nanother, the idea of motion. This idea of motion represents it as it\nreally is in manna moving: a circle or square are the same, whether in\nidea or existence, in the mind or in the manna. And this, both motion\nand as figure, are really in the manna, whether we take notice of\nprimary, them or no: this everybody is ready to agree to. Besides,\nmanna, by the bulk, figure, texture, and motion of its parts, has a\npower to produce the sensations of sickness, and sometimes of acute\npains or gripings in us. That these ideas of sickness and pain are NOT\nin the manna, but effects of its operations on us, and are nowhere when\nwe feel them not; this also every one readily agrees to. And yet men\nare hardly to be brought to think that sweetness and whiteness are not\nreally in manna; which are but the effects of the operations of manna,\nby the motion, size, and figure of its particles, on the eyes and\npalate: as the pain and sickness caused by manna are confessedly\nnothing but the effects of its operations on the stomach and guts, by\nthe size, motion, and figure of its insensible parts, (for by nothing\nelse can a body operate, as has been proved): as if it could not\noperate on the eyes and palate, and thereby produce in the mind\nparticular distinct ideas, which in itself it has not, as well as we\nallow it can operate on the guts and stomach, and thereby produce\ndistinct ideas, which in itself it has not. These ideas, being all\neffects of the operations of manna on several parts of our bodies, by\nthe size, figure, number, and motion of its parts;\u2014why those produced\nby the eyes and palate should rather be thought to be really in the\nmanna, than those produced by the stomach and guts; or why the pain and\nsickness, ideas that are the effect of manna, should be thought to be\nnowhere when they are not felt; and yet the sweetness and whiteness,\neffects of the same manna on other parts of the body, by ways equally\nas unknown, should be thought to exist in the manna, when they are not\nseen or tasted, would need some reason to explain.\n19. Examples.\nLet us consider the red and white colours in porphyry. Hinder light\nfrom striking on it, and its colours vanish; it no longer produces any\nsuch ideas in us: upon the return of light it produces these\nappearances on us again. Can any one think any real alterations are\nmade in the porphyry by the presence or absence of light; and that\nthose ideas of whiteness and redness are really in porphryry in the\nlight, when it is plain IT HAS NO COLOUR IN THE DARK? It has, indeed,\nsuch a configuration of particles, both night and day, as are apt, by\nthe rays of light rebounding from some parts of that hard stone, to\nproduce in us the idea of redness, and from others the idea of\nwhiteness; but whiteness or redness are not in it at any time, but such\na texture that hath the power to produce such a sensation in us.\n20. Pound an almond, and the clear white colour will be altered into a\ndirty one, and the sweet taste into an oily one. What real alteration\ncan the beating of the pestle make in an body, but an alteration of the\ntexture of it?\n21. Explains how water felt as cold by one hand may be warm to the\nother.\nIdeas being thus distinguished and understood, we may be able to give\nan account how the same water, at the same time, may produce the idea\nof cold by one hand and of heat by the other: whereas it is impossible\nthat the same water, if those ideas were really in it, should at the\nsame time be both hot and cold. For, if we imagine WARMTH, as it is in\nour hands, to be nothing but a certain sort and degree of motion in the\nminute particles of our nerves or animal spirits, we may understand how\nit is possible that the same water may, at the same time, produce the\nsensations of heat in one hand and cold in the other; which yet FIGURE\nnever does, that never producing the idea of a square by one hand which\nhas produced the idea of a globe by another. But if the sensation of\nheat and cold be nothing but the increase or diminution of the motion\nof the minute parts of our bodies, caused by the corpuscles of any\nother body, it is easy to be understood, that if that motion be greater\nin one hand than in the other; if a body be applied to the two hands,\nwhich has in its minute particles a greater motion than in those of one\nof the hands, and a less than in those of the other, it will increase\nthe motion of the one hand and lessen it in the other; and so cause the\ndifferent sensations of heat and cold that depend thereon.\n22. An excursion into natural philosophy.\nI have in what just goes before been engaged in physical inquiries a\nlittle further than perhaps I intended. But, it being necessary to make\nthe nature of sensation a little understood; and to make the difference\nbetween the QUALITIES in bodies, and the IDEAS produced by them in the\nmind, to be distinctly conceived, without which it were impossible to\ndiscourse intelligibly of them;\u2014I hope I shall be pardoned this little\nexcursion into natural philosophy; it being necessary in our present\ninquiry to distinguish the PRIMARY and REAL qualities of bodies, which\nare always in them (viz. solidity, extension, figure, number, and\nmotion, or rest, and are sometimes perceived by us, viz. when the\nbodies they are in are big enough singly to be discerned), from those\nSECONDARY and IMPUTED qualities, which are but the powers of several\ncombinations of those primary ones, when they operate without being\ndistinctly discerned;\u2014whereby we may also come to know what ideas are,\nand what are not, resemblances of something really existing in the\nbodies we denominate from them.\n23. Three Sorts of Qualities in Bodies.\nThe qualities, then, that are in bodies, rightly considered are of\nthree sorts:\u2014\nFIRST, The bulk, figure, number, situation, and motion or rest of their\nsolid parts. Those are in them, whether we perceive them or not; and\nwhen they are of that size that we can discover them, we have by these\nan idea of the thing as it is in itself; as is plain in artificial\nthings. These I call PRIMARY QUALITIES.\nSECONDLY, The power that is in any body, by reason of its insensible\nprimary qualities, to operate after a peculiar manner on any of our\nsenses, and thereby produce in US the different ideas of several\ncolours, sounds, smells, tastes, &c. These are usually called SENSIBLE\nQUALITIES.\nTHIRDLY, The power that is in any body, by reason of the particular\nconstitution of its primary qualities, to make such a change in the\nbulk, figure, texture, and motion of ANOTHER BODY, as to make it\noperate on our senses differently from what it did before. Thus the sun\nhas a power to make wax white, and fire to make lead fluid.\nThe first of these, as has been said, I think may be properly called\nreal, original, or primary qualities; because they are in the things\nthemselves, whether they are perceived or not: and upon their different\nmodifications it is that the secondary qualities depend.\nThe other two are only powers to act differently upon other things:\nwhich powers result from the different modifications of those primary\nqualities.\n24. The first are Resemblances; the second thought to be Resemblances,\nbut are not, the third neither are nor are thought so.\nBut, though the two latter sorts of qualities are powers barely, and\nnothing but powers, relating to several other bodies, and resulting\nfrom the different modifications of the original qualities, yet they\nare generally otherwise thought of. For the SECOND sort, viz. the\npowers to produce several ideas in us, by our senses, are looked upon\nas real qualities in the things thus affecting us: but the THIRD sort\nare called and esteemed barely powers, v.g. The idea of heat or light,\nwhich we receive by our eyes, or touch, from the sun, are commonly\nthought real qualities existing in the sun, and something more than\nmere powers in it. But when we consider the sun in reference to wax,\nwhich it melts or blanches, we look on the whiteness and softness\nproduced in the wax, not as qualities in the sun, but effects produced\nby powers in it. Whereas, if rightly considered, these qualities of\nlight and warmth, which are perceptions in me when I am warmed or\nenlightened by the sun, are no otherwise in the sun, than the changes\nmade in the wax, when it is blanched or melted, are in the sun. They\nare all of them equally POWERS IN THE SUN, DEPENDING ON ITS PRIMARY\nQUALITIES; whereby it is able, in the one case, so to alter the bulk,\nfigure, texture, or motion of some of the insensible parts of my eyes\nor hands, as thereby to produce in me the idea of light or heat; and in\nthe other, it is able so to alter the bulk, figure, texture, or motion\nof the insensible parts of the wax, as to make them fit to produce in\nme the distinct ideas of white and fluid.\n25. Why the secondary are ordinarily taken for real Qualities and not\nfor bare Powers.\nThe reason why the one are ordinarily taken for real qualities, and the\nother only for bare powers, seems to be because the ideas we have of\ndistinct colours, sounds, &c. containing nothing at all in them of\nbulk, figure, or motion we are not apt to think them the effects of\nthese primary qualities; which appear not, to our senses, to operate in\ntheir production, and with which they have not any apparent congruity\nor conceivable connexion. Hence it is that we are so forward as to\nimagine, that those ideas are the resemblances of something really\nexisting in the objects themselves since sensation discovers nothing of\nbulk, figure, or motion of parts in their production; nor can reason\nshow how bodies BY THEIR BULK, FIGURE, AND MOTION, should produce in\nthe mind the ideas of blue or yellow, &c. But, in the other case in the\noperations of bodies changing the qualities one of another, we plainly\ndiscover that the quality produced hath commonly no resemblance with\nanything in the thing producing it; wherefore we look on it as a bare\neffect of power. For, through receiving the idea of heat or light from\nthe sun, we are apt to think IT is a perception and resemblance of such\na quality in the sun; yet when we see wax, or a fair face, receive\nchange of colour from the sun, we cannot imagine THAT to be the\nreception or resemblance of anything in the sun, because we find not\nthose different colours in the sun itself. For, our senses being able\nto observe a likeness or unlikeness of sensible qualities in two\ndifferent external objects, we forwardly enough conclude the production\nof any sensible quality in any subject to be an effect of bare power,\nand not the communication of any quality which was really in the\nefficient, when we find no such sensible quality in the thing that\nproduced it. But our senses, not being able to discover any unlikeness\nbetween the idea produced in us, and the quality of the object\nproducing it, we are apt to imagine that our ideas are resemblances of\nsomething in the objects, and not the effects of certain powers placed\nin the modification of their primary qualities, with which primary\nqualities the ideas produced in us have no resemblance.\n26. Secondary Qualities twofold; first, immediately perceivable;\nsecondly, mediately perceivable.\nTo conclude. Beside those before-mentioned primary qualities in bodies,\nviz. bulk, figure, extension, number, and motion of their solid parts;\nall the rest, whereby we take notice of bodies, and distinguish them\none from another, are nothing else but several powers in them,\ndepending on those primary qualities; whereby they are fitted, either\nby immediately operating on our bodies to produce several different\nideas in us; or else, by operating on other bodies, so to change their\nprimary qualities as to render them capable of producing ideas in us\ndifferent from what before they did. The former of these, I think, may\nbe called secondary qualities IMMEDIATELY PERCEIVABLE: the latter,\nsecondary qualities, MEDIATELY PERCEIVABLE.\nCHAPTER IX.\nOF PERCEPTION.\n1. Perception the first simple Idea of Reflection.\nPERCEPTION, as it is the first faculty of the mind exercised about our\nideas; so it is the first and simplest idea we have from reflection,\nand is by some called thinking in general. Though thinking, in the\npropriety of the English tongue, signifies that sort of operation in\nthe mind about its ideas, wherein the mind is active; where it, with\nsome degree of voluntary attention, considers anything. For in bare\nnaked perception, the mind is, for the most part, only passive; and\nwhat it perceives, it cannot avoid perceiving.\n2. Reflection alone can give us the idea of what perception is.\nWhat perception is, every one will know better by reflecting on what he\ndoes himself, when he sees, hears, feels, &c., or thinks, than by any\ndiscourse of mine. Whoever reflects on what passes in his own mind\ncannot miss it. And if he does not reflect, all the words in the world\ncannot make him have any notion of it.\n3. Arises in sensation only when the mind notices the organic\nimpression.\nThis is certain, that whatever alterations are made in the body, if\nthey reach not the mind; whatever impressions are made on the outward\nparts, if they are not taken notice of within, there is no perception.\nFire may burn our bodies with no other effect than it does a billet,\nunless the motion be continued to the brain, and there the sense of\nheat, or idea of pain, be produced in the mind; wherein consists actual\nperception.\n4. Impulse on the organ insufficient.\nHow often may a man observe in himself, that whilst his mind is\nintently employed in the contemplation of some objects, and curiously\nsurveying some ideas that are there, it takes no notice of impressions\nof sounding bodies made upon the organ of hearing, with the same\nalteration that uses to be for the producing the idea of sound? A\nsufficient impulse there may be on the organ; but it not reaching the\nobservation of the mind, there follows no perception: and though the\nmotion that uses to produce the idea of sound be made in the ear, yet\nno sound is heard. Want of sensation, in this case, is not through any\ndefect in the organ, or that the man\u2019s ears are less affected than at\nother times when he does hear but that which uses to produce the idea,\nthough conveyed in by the usual organ, not being taken notice of in the\nunderstanding, and so imprinting no idea in the mind, there follows no\nsensation. So that wherever there is sense of perception, there some\nidea is actually produced, and present in the understanding.\n5. Children, though they may have Ideas in the Womb, have none innate.\nTherefore I doubt not but children, by the exercise of their senses\nabout objects that affect them in the womb receive some few ideas\nbefore they are born, as the unavoidable effects, either of the bodies\nthat environ them, or else of those wants or diseases they suffer;\namongst which (if one may conjecture concerning things not very capable\nof examination) I think the ideas of hunger and warmth are two: which\nprobably are some of the first that children have, and which they\nscarce ever part with again.\n6. The effects of Sensation in the womb.\nBut though it be reasonable to imagine that children receive some ideas\nbefore they come into the world, yet these simple ideas are far from\nthose INNATE PRINCIPLES which some contend for, and we, above, have\nrejected. These here mentioned, being the effects of sensation, are\nonly from some affections of the body, which happen to them there, and\nso depend on something exterior to the mind; no otherwise differing in\ntheir manner of production from other ideas derived from sense, but\nonly in the precedency of time. Whereas those innate principles are\nsupposed to be quite of another nature; not coming into the mind by any\naccidental alterations in, or operations on the body; but, as it were,\noriginal characters impressed upon it, in the very first moment of its\nbeing and constitution.\n7. Which Ideas appear first is not evident, nor important.\nAs there are some ideas which we may reasonably suppose may be\nintroduced into the minds of children in the womb, subservient to the\nnecessities of their life and being there: so, after they are born,\nthose ideas are the earliest imprinted which happen to be the sensible\nqualities which first occur to them; amongst which light is not the\nleast considerable, nor of the weakest efficacy. And how covetous the\nmind is to be furnished with all such ideas as have no pain\naccompanying them, may be a little guessed by what is observable in\nchildren new-born; who always turn their eyes to that part from whence\nthe light comes, lay them how you please. But the ideas that are most\nfamiliar at first, being various according to the divers circumstances\nof children\u2019s first entertainment in the world, the order wherein the\nseveral ideas come at first into the mind is very various, and\nuncertain also; neither is it much material to know it.\n8. Sensations often changed by the Judgment.\nWe are further to consider concerning perception, that the ideas we\nreceive by sensation are often, in grown people, altered by the\njudgment, without our taking notice of it. When we set before our eyes\na round globe of any uniform colour, v.g. gold, alabaster, or jet, it\nis certain that the idea thereby imprinted on our mind is of a flat\ncircle, variously shadowed, with several degrees of light and\nbrightness coming to our eyes. But we having, by use, been accustomed\nto perceive what kind of appearance convex bodies are wont to make in\nus; what alterations are made in the reflections of light by the\ndifference of the sensible figures of bodies;\u2014the judgment presently,\nby an habitual custom, alters the appearances into their causes. So\nthat from that which is truly variety of shadow or colour, collecting\nthe figure, it makes it pass for a mark of figure, and frames to itself\nthe perception of a convex figure and an uniform colour; when the idea\nwe receive from thence is only a plane variously coloured, as is\nevident in painting. To which purpose I shall here insert a problem of\nthat very ingenious and studious promoter of real knowledge, the\nlearned and worthy Mr. Molineux, which he was pleased to send me in a\nletter some months since; and it is this:\u2014\u201cSuppose a man BORN blind,\nand now adult, and taught by his TOUCH to distinguish between a cube\nand a sphere of the same metal, and nighly of the same bigness, so as\nto tell, when he felt one and the other, which is the cube, which the\nsphere. Suppose then the cube and sphere placed on a table, and the\nblind man be made to see: quaere, whether BY HIS SIGHT, BEFORE HE\nTOUCHED THEM, he could now distinguish and tell which is the globe,\nwhich the cube?\u201d To which the acute and judicious proposer answers,\n\u201cNot. For, though he has obtained the experience of how a globe, how a\ncube affects his touch, yet he has not yet obtained the experience,\nthat what affects his touch so or so, must affect his sight so or so;\nor that a protuberant angle in the cube, that pressed his hand\nunequally, shall appear to his eye as it does in the cube.\u201d\u2014I agree\nwith this thinking gentleman, whom I am proud to call my friend, in his\nanswer to this problem; and am of opinion that the blind man, at first\nsight, would not be able with certainty to say which was the globe,\nwhich the cube, whilst he only saw them; though he could unerringly\nname them by his touch, and certainly distinguish them by the\ndifference of their figures felt. This I have set down, and leave with\nmy reader, as an occasion for him to consider how much he may be\nbeholden to experience, improvement, and acquired notions, where he\nthinks he had not the least use of, or help from them. And the rather,\nbecause this observing gentleman further adds, that \u201chaving, upon the\noccasion of my book, proposed this to divers very ingenious men, he\nhardly ever met with one that at first gave the answer to it which he\nthinks true, till by hearing his reasons they were convinced.\u201d\n9. This judgement apt to be mistaken for direct perception.\nBut this is not, I think, usual in any of our ideas, but those received\nby sight. Because sight, the most comprehensive of all our senses,\nconveying to our minds the ideas of light and colours, which are\npeculiar only to that sense; and also the far different ideas of space,\nfigure, and motion, the several varieties whereof change the\nappearances of its proper object, viz. light and colours; we bring\nourselves by use to judge of the one by the other. This, in many cases\nby a settled habit,\u2014in things whereof we have frequent experience is\nperformed so constantly and so quick, that we take that for the\nperception of our sensation which is an idea formed by our judgment; so\nthat one, viz. that of sensation, serves only to excite the other, and\nis scarce taken notice of itself;\u2014as a man who reads or hears with\nattention and understanding, takes little notice of the characters or\nsounds, but of the ideas that are excited in him by them.\n10. How, by Habit, ideas of Sensation are unconsciously changed into\nideas of Judgment.\nNor need we wonder that this is done with so little notice, if we\nconsider how quick the actions of the mind are performed. For, as\nitself is thought to take up no space to have no extension; so its\nactions seem to require no time but many of them seem to be crowded\ninto an instant. I speak this in comparison to the actions of the body.\nAny one may easily observe this in his own thoughts, who will take the\npains to reflect on them. How, as it were in an instant, do our minds,\nwith one glance, see all the parts of a demonstration, which may very\nwell be called a long one, if we consider the time it will require to\nput it into words, and step by step show it another? Secondly, we shall\nnot be so much surprised that this is done in us with so little notice,\nif we consider how the facility which we get of doing things, by a\ncustom of doing, makes them often pass in us without our notice.\nHabits, especially such as are begun very early, come at last to\nproduce actions in us, which often escape our observation. How\nfrequently do we, in a day, cover our eyes with our eyelids, without\nperceiving that we are at all in the dark! Men that, by custom, have\ngot the use of a by-word, do almost in every sentence pronounce sounds\nwhich, though taken notice of by others, they themselves neither hear\nnor observe. And therefore it is not so strange, that our mind should\noften change the idea of its sensation into that of its judgment, and\nmake one serve only to excite the other, without our taking notice of\nit.\n11. Perception puts the difference between Animals and Vegetables.\nThis faculty of perception seems to me to be, that which puts the\ndistinction betwixt the animal kingdom and the inferior parts of\nnature. For, however vegetables have, many of them, some degrees of\nmotion, and upon the different application of other bodies to them, do\nvery briskly alter their figures and motions, and so have obtained the\nname of sensitive plants, from a motion which has some resemblance to\nthat which in animals follows upon sensation: yet I suppose it is all\nbare MECHANISM; and no otherwise produced than the turning of a wild\noat-beard, by the insinuation of the particles of moisture, or the\nshortening of a rope, by the affusion of water. All which is done\nwithout any sensation in the subject, or the having or receiving any\nideas.\n12. Perception in all animals.\nPerception, I believe, is, in some degree, in all sorts of animals;\nthough in some possibly the avenues provided by nature for the\nreception of sensations are so few, and the perception they are\nreceived with so obscure and dull, that it comes extremely short of the\nquickness and variety of sensation which is in other animals; but yet\nit is sufficient for, and wisely adapted to, the state and condition of\nthat sort of animals who are thus made. So that the wisdom and goodness\nof the Maker plainly appear in all the parts of this stupendous fabric,\nand all the several degrees and ranks of creatures in it.\n13. According to their condition.\nWe may, I think, from the make of an oyster or cockle, reasonably\nconclude that it has not so many, nor so quick senses as a man, or\nseveral other animals; nor if it had, would it, in that state and\nincapacity of transferring itself from one place to another, be\nbettered by them. What good would sight and hearing do to a creature\nthat cannot move itself to or from the objects wherein at a distance it\nperceives good or evil? And would not quickness of sensation be an\ninconvenience to an animal that must lie still where chance has once\nplaced it, and there receive the afflux of colder or warmer, clean or\nfoul water, as it happens to come to it?\n14. Decay of perception in old age.\nBut yet I cannot but think there is some small dull perception, whereby\nthey are distinguished from perfect insensibility. And that this may be\nso, we have plain instances, even in mankind itself. Take one in whom\ndecrepit old age has blotted out the memory of his past knowledge, and\nclearly wiped out the ideas his mind was formerly stored with, and has,\nby destroying his sight, hearing, and smell quite, and his taste to a\ngreat degree, stopped up almost all the passages for new ones to enter;\nor if there be some of the inlets yet half open, the impressions made\nare scarcely perceived, or not at all retained. How far such an one\n(notwithstanding all that is boasted of innate principles) is in his\nknowledge and intellectual faculties above the condition of a cockle or\nan oyster, I leave to be considered. And if a man had passed sixty\nyears in such a state, as it is possible he might, as well as three\ndays, I wonder what difference there would be, in any intellectual\nperfections, between him and the lowest degree of animals.\n15. Perception the Inlet of all materials of Knowledge.\nPerception then being the FIRST step and degree towards knowledge, and\nthe inlet of all the materials of it; the fewer senses any man, as well\nas any other creature, hath; and the fewer and duller the impressions\nare that are made by them; and the duller the faculties are that are\nemployed about them,\u2014the more remote are they from that knowledge which\nis to be found in some men. But this being in great variety of degrees\n(as may be perceived amongst men) cannot certainly be discovered in the\nseveral species of animals, much less in their particular individuals.\nIt suffices me only to have remarked here,\u2014that perception is the first\noperation of all our intellectual faculties, and the inlet of all\nknowledge in our minds. And I am apt too to imagine, that it is\nperception, in the lowest degree of it, which puts the boundaries\nbetween animals and the inferior ranks of creatures. But this I mention\nonly as my conjecture by the by; it being indifferent to the matter in\nhand which way the learned shall determine of it.\nCHAPTER X.\nOF RETENTION.\n1. Contemplation\nThe next faculty of the mind, whereby it makes a further progress\ntowards knowledge, is that which I call RETENTION; or the keeping of\nthose simple ideas which from sensation or reflection it hath received.\nThis is done two ways.\nFirst, by keeping the idea which is brought into it, for some time\nactually in view, which is called CONTEMPLATION.\n2. Memory.\nThe other way of retention is, the power to revive again in our minds\nthose ideas which, after imprinting, have disappeared, or have been as\nit were laid aside out of sight. And thus we do, when we conceive heat\nor light, yellow or sweet,\u2014the object being removed. This is MEMORY,\nwhich is as it were the storehouse of our ideas. For, the narrow mind\nof man not being capable of having many ideas under view and\nconsideration at once, it was necessary to have a repository, to lay up\nthose ideas which, at another time, it might have use of. But, our\nIDEAS being nothing but actual perceptions in the mind, which cease to\nbe anything; when there is no perception of them; this laying up of our\nideas in the repository of the memory signifies no more but this,\u2014that\nthe mind has a power in many cases to revive perceptions which it has\nonce had, with this additional perception annexed to them, that IT HAS\nHAD THEM BEFORE. And in this sense it is that our ideas are said to be\nin our memories, when indeed they are actually nowhere;\u2014but only there\nis an ability in the mind when it will to revive them again, and as it\nwere paint them anew on itself, though some with more, some with less\ndifficulty; some more lively, and others more obscurely. And thus it\nis, by the assistance of this faculty, that we are said to have all\nthose ideas in our understandings which, though we do not actually\ncontemplate yet we CAN bring in sight, and make appear again, and be\nthe objects of our thoughts, without the help of those sensible\nqualities which first imprinted them there.\n3. Attention, Repetition, Pleasure and Pain, fix Ideas.\nAttention and repetition help much to the fixing any ideas in the\nmemory. But those which naturally at first make the deepest and most\nlasting impressions, are those which are accompanied with pleasure or\npain. The great business of the senses being, to make us take notice of\nwhat hurts or advantages the body, it is wisely ordered by nature, as\nhas been shown, that pain should accompany the reception of several\nideas; which, supplying the place of consideration and reasoning in\nchildren, and acting quicker than consideration in grown men, makes\nboth the old and young avoid painful objects with that haste which is\nnecessary for their preservation; and in both settles in the memory a\ncaution for the future.\n4. Ideas fade in the Memory.\nConcerning the several degrees of lasting, wherewith ideas are\nimprinted on the memory, we may observe,\u2014that some of them have been\nproduced in the understanding by an object affecting the senses once\nonly, and no more than once; others, that have more than once offered\nthemselves to the senses, have yet been little taken notice of: the\nmind, either heedless, as in children, or otherwise employed, as in men\nintent only on one thing; not setting the stamp deep into itself. And\nin some, where they are set on with care and repeated impressions,\neither through the temper of the body, or some other fault, the memory\nis very weak. In all these cases, ideas in the mind quickly fade, and\noften vanish quite out of the understanding, leaving no more footsteps\nor remaining characters of themselves than shadows do flying over\nfields of corn, and the mind is as void of them as if they had never\nbeen there.\n5. Causes of oblivion.\nThus many of those ideas which were produced in the minds of children,\nin the beginning of their sensation, (some of which perhaps, as of some\npleasures and pains, were before they were born, and others in their\ninfancy,) if in the future course of their lives they are not repeated\nagain, are quite lost, without the least glimpse remaining of them.\nThis may be observed in those who by some mischance have lost their\nsight when they were very young; in whom the ideas of colours having\nbeen but slightly taken notice of, and ceasing to be repeated, do quite\nwear out; so that some years after, there is no more notion nor memory\nof colours left in their minds, than in those of people born blind. The\nmemory of some men, it is true, is very tenacious, even to a miracle.\nBut yet there seems to be a constant decay of all our ideas, even of\nthose which are struck deepest, and in minds the most retentive; so\nthat if they be not sometimes renewed, by repeated exercise of the\nsenses, or reflection on those kinds of objects which at first\noccasioned them, the print wears out, and at last there remains nothing\nto be seen. Thus the ideas, as well as children, of our youth, often\ndie before us: and our minds represent to us those tombs to which we\nare approaching; where, though the brass and marble remain, yet the\ninscriptions are effaced by time, and the imagery moulders away. The\npictures drawn in our minds are laid in fading colours; and if not\nsometimes refreshed, vanish and disappear. How much the constitution of\nour bodies are concerned in this; and whether the temper of the brain\nmakes this difference, that in some it retains the characters drawn on\nit like marble, in others like freestone, and in others little better\nthan sand, I shall here inquire; though it may seem probable that the\nconstitution of the body does sometimes influence the memory, since we\noftentimes find a disease quite strip the mind of all its ideas, and\nthe flames of a fever in a few days calcine all those images to dust\nand confusion, which seemed to be as lasting as if graved in marble.\n6. Constantly repeated Ideas can scarce be lost.\nBut concerning the ideas themselves, it is easy to remark, that those\nthat are oftenest refreshed (amongst which are those that are conveyed\ninto the mind by more ways than one) by a frequent return of the\nobjects or actions that produce them, fix themselves best in the\nmemory, and remain clearest and longest there; and therefore those\nwhich are of the original qualities of bodies, viz. solidity,\nextension, figure, motion, and rest; and those that almost constantly\naffect our bodies, as heat and cold; and those which are the affections\nof all kinds of beings, as existence, duration, and number, which\nalmost every object that affects our senses, every thought which\nemploys our minds, bring along with them;\u2014these, I say, and the like\nideas, are seldom quite lost, whilst the mind retains any ideas at all.\n7. In Remembering, the Mind is often active.\nIn this secondary perception, as I may so call it, or viewing again the\nideas that are lodged in the memory, the mind is oftentimes more than\nbarely passive; the appearance of those dormant pictures depending\nsometimes on the WILL. The mind very often sets itself on work in\nsearch of some hidden idea, and turns as it were the eye of the soul\nupon it; though sometimes too they start up in our minds of their own\naccord, and offer themselves to the understanding; and very often are\nroused and tumbled out of their dark cells into open daylight, by\nturbulent and tempestuous passions; our affections bringing ideas to\nour memory, which had otherwise lain quiet and unregarded. This further\nis to be observed, concerning ideas lodged in the memory, and upon\noccasion revived by the mind, that they are not only (as the word\nREVIVE imports) none of them new ones, but also that the mind takes\nnotice of them as of a former impression, and renews its acquaintance\nwith them, as with ideas it had known before. So that though ideas\nformerly imprinted are not all constantly in view, yet in remembrance\nthey are constantly known to be such as have been formerly imprinted;\ni.e. in view, and taken notice of before, by the understanding.\n8. Two defects in the Memory, Oblivion and Slowness.\nMemory, in an intellectual creature, is necessary in the next degree to\nperception. It is of so great moment, that, where it is wanting, all\nthe rest of our faculties are in a great measure useless. And we in our\nthoughts, reasonings, and knowledge, could not proceed beyond present\nobjects, were it not for the assistance of our memories; wherein there\nmay be two defects:\u2014\nFirst, That it loses the idea quite, and so far it produces perfect\nignorance. For, since we can know nothing further than we have the idea\nof it, when that is gone, we are in perfect ignorance.\nSecondly, That it moves slowly, and retrieves not the ideas that it\nhas, and are laid up in store, quick enough to serve the mind upon\noccasion. This, if it be to a great degree, is stupidity; and he who,\nthrough this default in his memory, has not the ideas that are really\npreserved there, ready at hand when need and occasion calls for them,\nwere almost as good be without them quite, since they serve him to\nlittle purpose. The dull man, who loses the opportunity, whilst he is\nseeking in his mind for those ideas that should serve his turn, is not\nmuch more happy in his knowledge than one that is perfectly ignorant.\nIt is the business therefore of the memory to furnish to the mind those\ndormant ideas which it has present occasion for; in the having them\nready at hand on all occasions, consists that which we call invention,\nfancy, and quickness of parts.\n9. A defect which belongs to the memory of Man, as finite.\nThese are defects we may observe in the memory of one man compared with\nanother. There is another defect which we may conceive to be in the\nmemory of man in general;\u2014compared with some superior created\nintellectual beings, which in this faculty may so far excel man, that\nthey may have CONSTANTLY in view the whole scene of all their former\nactions, wherein no one of the thoughts they have ever had may slip out\nof their sight. The omniscience of God, who knows all things, past,\npresent, and to come, and to whom the thoughts of men\u2019s hearts always\nlie open, may satisfy us of the possibility of this. For who can doubt\nbut God may communicate to those glorious spirits, his immediate\nattendants, any of his perfections; in what proportions he pleases, as\nfar as created finite beings can be capable? It is reported of that\nprodigy of parts, Monsieur Pascal, that till the decay of his health\nhad impaired his memory, he forgot nothing of what he had done, read,\nor thought, in any part of his rational age. This is a privilege so\nlittle known to most men, that it seems almost incredible to those who,\nafter the ordinary way, measure all others by themselves; but yet, when\nconsidered, may help us to enlarge our thoughts towards greater\nperfections of it, in superior ranks of spirits. For this of Monsieur\nPascal was still with the narrowness that human minds are confined to\nhere,\u2014of having great variety of ideas only by succession, not all at\nonce. Whereas the several degrees of angels may probably have larger\nviews; and some of them be endowed with capacities able to retain\ntogether, and constantly set before them, as in one picture, all their\npast knowledge at once. This, we may conceive, would be no small\nadvantage to the knowledge of a thinking man,\u2014if all his past thoughts\nand reasonings could be ALWAYS present to him. And therefore we may\nsuppose it one of those ways, wherein the knowledge of separate spirits\nmay exceedingly surpass ours.\n10. Brutes have Memory.\nThis faculty of laying up and retaining the ideas that are brought into\nthe mind, several other animals seem to have to a great degree, as well\nas man. For, to pass by other instances, birds learning of tunes, and\nthe endeavours one may observe in them to hit the notes right, put it\npast doubt with me, that they have perception, and retain ideas in\ntheir memories, and use them for patterns. For it seems to me\nimpossible that they should endeavour to conform their voices to notes\n(as it is plain they do) of which they had no ideas. For, though I\nshould grant sound may mechanically cause a certain motion of the\nanimal spirits in the brains of those birds, whilst the tune is\nactually playing; and that motion may be continued on to the muscles of\nthe wings, and so the bird mechanically be driven away by certain\nnoises, because this may tend to the bird\u2019s preservation; yet that can\nnever be supposed a reason why it should cause mechanically\u2014either\nwhilst the tune is playing, much less after it has ceased\u2014such a motion\nof the organs in the bird\u2019s voice as should conform it to the notes of\na foreign sound, which imitation can be of no use to the bird\u2019s\npreservation. But, which is more, it cannot with any appearance of\nreason be supposed (much less proved) that birds, without sense and\nmemory, can approach their notes nearer and nearer by degrees to a tune\nplayed yesterday; which if they have no idea of in their memory, is now\nnowhere, nor can be a pattern for them to imitate, or which any\nrepeated essays can bring them nearer to. Since there is no reason why\nthe sound of a pipe should leave traces in their brains, which, not at\nfirst, but by their after-endeavours, should produce the like sounds;\nand why the sounds they make themselves, should not make traces which\nthey should follow, as well as those of the pipe, is impossible to\nconceive.\nCHAPTER XI.\nOF DISCERNING, AND OTHER OPERATIONS OF THE MIND.\n1. No Knowledge without Discernment.\nAnother faculty we may take notice of in our minds is that of\nDISCERNING and DISTINGUISHING between the several ideas it has. It is\nnot enough to have a confused perception of something in general.\nUnless the mind had a distinct perception of different objects and\ntheir qualities, it would be capable of very little knowledge, though\nthe bodies that affect us were as busy about us as they are now, and\nthe mind were continually employed in thinking. On this faculty of\ndistinguishing one thing from another depends the evidence and\ncertainty of several, even very general, propositions, which have\npassed for innate truths;\u2014because men, overlooking the true cause why\nthose propositions find universal assent, impute it wholly to native\nuniform impressions; whereas it in truth depends upon this clear\ndiscerning faculty of the mind, whereby it PERCEIVES two ideas to be\nthe same, or different. But of this more hereafter.\n2. The Difference of Wit and Judgment.\nHow much the imperfection of accurately discriminating ideas one from\nanother lies, either in the dulness or faults of the organs of sense;\nor want of acuteness, exercise, or attention in the understanding; or\nhastiness and precipitancy, natural to some tempers, I will not here\nexamine: it suffices to take notice, that this is one of the operations\nthat the mind may reflect on and observe in itself. It is of that\nconsequence to its other knowledge, that so far as this faculty is in\nitself dull, or not rightly made use of, for the distinguishing one\nthing from another,\u2014so far our notions are confused, and our reason and\njudgment disturbed or misled. If in having our ideas in the memory\nready at hand consists quickness of parts; in this, of having them\nunconfused, and being able nicely to distinguish one thing from\nanother, where there is but the least difference, consists, in a great\nmeasure, the exactness of judgment, and clearness of reason, which is\nto be observed in one man above another. And hence perhaps may be given\nsome reason of that common observation,\u2014that men who have a great deal\nof wit, and prompt memories, have not always the clearest judgment or\ndeepest reason. For WIT lying most in the assemblage of ideas, and\nputting those together with quickness and variety, wherein can be found\nany resemblance or congruity, thereby to make up pleasant pictures and\nagreeable visions in the fancy; JUDGMENT, on the contrary, lies quite\non the other side, in separating carefully, one from another, ideas\nwherein can be found the least difference, thereby to avoid being\nmisled by similitude, and by affinity to take one thing for another.\nThis is a way of proceeding quite contrary to metaphor and allusion;\nwherein for the most part lies that entertainment and pleasantry of\nwit, which strikes so lively on the fancy, and therefore is so\nacceptable to all people, because its beauty appears at first sight,\nand there is required no labour of thought to examine what truth or\nreason there is in it. The mind, without looking any further, rests\nsatisfied with the agreeableness of the picture and the gaiety of the\nfancy. And it is a kind of affront to go about to examine it, by the\nsevere rules of truth and good reason; whereby it appears that it\nconsists in something that is not perfectly conformable to them.\n3. Clearness alone hinders Confusion.\nTo the well distinguishing our ideas, it chiefly contributes that they\nbe CLEAR and DETERMINATE. And when they are so, it will not breed any\nconfusion or mistake about them, though the senses should (as sometimes\nthey do) convey them from the same object differently on different\noccasions, and so seem to err. For, though a man in a fever should from\nsugar have a bitter taste, which at another time would produce a sweet\none, yet the idea of bitter in that man\u2019s mind would be as clear and\ndistinct from the idea of sweet as if he had tasted only gall. Nor does\nit make any more confusion between the two ideas of sweet and bitter\nthat the same sort of body produces at one time one, and at another\ntime another idea by the taste, than it makes a confusion in two ideas\nof white and sweet, or white and round, that the same piece of sugar\nproduces them both in the mind at the same time. And the ideas of\norange-colour and azure, that are produced in the mind by the same\nparcel of the infusion of lignum nephritium, are no less distinct ideas\nthan those of the same colours taken from two very different bodies.\n4. Comparing.\nThe COMPARING them one with another, in respect of extent, degrees,\ntime, place, or any other circumstances, is another operation of the\nmind about its ideas, and is that upon which depends all that large\ntribe of ideas comprehended under RELATION; which, of how vast an\nextent it is, I shall have occasion to consider hereafter.\n5. Brutes compare but imperfectly.\nHow far brutes partake in this faculty, is not easy to determine. I\nimagine they have it not in any great degree, for, though they probably\nhave several ideas distinct enough, yet it seems to me to be the\nprerogative of human understanding, when it has sufficiently\ndistinguished any ideas, so as to perceive them to be perfectly\ndifferent, and so consequently two, to cast about and consider in what\ncircumstances they are capable to be compared. And therefore, I think,\nbeasts compare not their ideas further than some sensible circumstances\nannexed to the objects themselves. The other power of comparing, which\nmay be observed in men, belonging to general ideas, and useful only to\nabstract reasonings, we may probably conjecture beasts have not.\n6. Compounding.\nThe next operation we may observe in the mind about its ideas is\nCOMPOSITION; whereby it puts together several of those simple ones it\nhas received from sensation and reflection, and combines them into\ncomplex ones. Under this of composition may be reckoned also that of\nENLARGING, wherein, though the composition does not so much appear as\nin more complex ones, yet it is nevertheless a putting several ideas\ntogether, though of the same kind. Thus, by adding several units\ntogether, we make the idea of a dozen; and putting together the\nrepeated ideas of several perches, we frame that of a furlong.\n7. Brutes compound but little.\nIn this also, I suppose, brutes come far short of man. For, though they\ntake in, and retain together, several combinations of simple ideas, as\npossibly the shape, smell, and voice of his master make up the complex\nidea a dog has of him, or rather are so many distinct marks whereby he\nknows him; yet I do not think they do of themselves ever compound them,\nand make complex ideas. And perhaps even where we think they have\ncomplex ideas, it is only one simple one that directs them in the\nknowledge of several things, which possibly they distinguish less by\ntheir sight than we imagine. For I have been credibly informed that a\nbitch will nurse, play with, and be fond of young foxes, as much as,\nand in place of her puppies, if you can but get them once to suck her\nso long that her milk may go through them. And those animals which have\na numerous brood of young ones at once, appear not to have any\nknowledge of their number; for though they are mightily concerned for\nany of their young that are taken from them whilst they are in sight or\nhearing, yet if one or two of them be stolen from them in their\nabsence, or without noise, they appear not to miss them, or to have any\nsense that their number is lessened.\n8. Naming.\nWhen children have, by repeated sensations, got ideas fixed in their\nmemories, they begin by degrees to learn the use of signs. And when\nthey have got the skill to apply the organs of speech to the framing of\narticulate sounds, they begin to make use of words, to signify their\nideas to others. These verbal signs they sometimes borrow from others,\nand sometimes make themselves, as one may observe among the new and\nunusual names children often give to things in the first use of\nlanguage.\n9. Abstraction.\nThe use of words then being to stand as outward mark of our internal\nideas, and those ideas being taken from particular things, if every\nparticular idea that we take up should have a distinct name, names must\nbe endless. To prevent this, the mind makes the particular ideas\nreceived from particular objects to become general; which is done by\nconsidering them as they are in the mind such appearances,\u2014separate\nfrom all other existences, and the circumstances of real existence, as\ntime, place, or any other concomitant ideas. This is called\nABSTRACTION, whereby ideas taken from particular beings become general\nrepresentatives of all of the same kind; and their names general names,\napplicable to whatever exists conformable to such abstract ideas. Such\nprecise, naked appearances in the mind, without considering how,\nwhence, or with what others they came there, the understanding lays up\n(with names commonly annexed to them) as the standards to rank real\nexistences into sorts, as they agree with these patterns, and to\ndenominate them accordingly. Thus the same colour being observed to-day\nin chalk or snow, which the mind yesterday received from milk, it\nconsiders that appearance alone, makes it a representative of all of\nthat kind; and having given it the name WHITENESS, it by that sound\nsignifies the same quality wheresoever to be imagined or met with; and\nthus universals, whether ideas or terms, are made.\n10. Brutes abstract not.\nIf it may be doubted whether beasts compound and enlarge their ideas\nthat way to any degree; this, I think, I may be positive in,\u2014that the\npower of abstracting is not at all in them; and that the having of\ngeneral ideas is that which puts a perfect distinction betwixt man and\nbrutes, and is an excellency which the faculties of brutes do by no\nmeans attain to. For it is evident we observe no footsteps in them of\nmaking use of general signs for universal ideas; from which we have\nreason to imagine that they have not the faculty of abstracting, or\nmaking general ideas, since they have no use of words, or any other\ngeneral signs.\n11. Brutes abstract not, yet are not bare machines.\nNor can it be imputed to their want of fit organs to frame articulate\nsounds, that they have no use or knowledge of general words; since many\nof them, we find, can fashion such sounds, and pronounce words\ndistinctly enough, but never with any such application. And, on the\nother side, men who, through some defect in the organs, want words, yet\nfail not to express their universal ideas by signs, which serve them\ninstead of general words, a faculty which we see beasts come short in.\nAnd, therefore, I think, we may suppose, that it is in this that the\nspecies of brutes are discriminated from man: and it is that proper\ndifference wherein they are wholly separated, and which at last widens\nto so vast a distance. For if they have any ideas at all, and are not\nbare machines, (as some would have them,) we cannot deny them to have\nsome reason. It seems as evident to me, that they do reason, as that\nthey have sense; but it is only in particular ideas, just as they\nreceived them from their senses. They are the best of them tied up\nwithin those narrow bounds, and have not (as I think) the faculty to\nenlarge them by any kind of abstraction.\n12. Idiots and Madmen.\nHow far idiots are concerned in the want or weakness of any, or all of\nthe foregoing faculties, an exact observation of their several ways of\nfaultering would no doubt discover. For those who either perceive but\ndully, or retain the ideas that come into their minds but ill, who\ncannot readily excite or compound them, will have little matter to\nthink on. Those who cannot distinguish, compare, and abstract, would\nhardly be able to understand and make use of language, or judge or\nreason to any tolerable degree; but only a little and imperfectly about\nthings present, and very familiar to their senses. And indeed any of\nthe forementioned faculties, if wanting, or out of order, produce\nsuitable defects in men\u2019s understandings and knowledge.\n13. Difference between Idiots and Madmen.\nIn fine, the defect in naturals seems to proceed from want of\nquickness, activity, and motion in the intellectual faculties, whereby\nthey are deprived of reason; whereas madmen, on the other side, seem to\nsuffer by the other extreme. For they do not appear to me to have lost\nthe faculty of reasoning, but having joined together some ideas very\nwrongly, they mistake them for truths; and they err as men do that\nargue right from wrong principles. For, by the violence of their\nimaginations, having taken their fancies for realities, they make right\ndeductions from them. Thus you shall find a distracted man fancying\nhimself a king, with a right inference require suitable attendance,\nrespect, and obedience: others who have thought themselves made of\nglass, have used the caution necessary to preserve such brittle bodies.\nHence it comes to pass that a man who is very sober, and of a right\nunderstanding in all other things, may in one particular be as frantic\nas any in Bedlam; if either by any sudden very strong impression, or\nlong fixing his fancy upon one sort of thoughts, incoherent ideas have\nbeen cemented together so powerfully, as to remain united. But there\nare degrees of madness, as of folly; the disorderly jumbling ideas\ntogether is in some more, and some less. In short, herein seems to lie\nthe difference between idiots and madmen: that madmen put wrong ideas\ntogether, and so make wrong propositions, but argue and reason right\nfrom them; but idiots make very few or no propositions, and reason\nscarce at all.\n14. Method followed in this explication of Faculties.\nThese, I think, are the first faculties and operations of the mind,\nwhich it makes use of in understanding; and though they are exercised\nabout all its ideas in general, yet the instances I have hitherto given\nhave been chiefly in simple ideas. And I have subjoined the explication\nof these faculties of the mind to that of simple ideas, before I come\nto what I have to say concerning complex ones, for these following\nreasons:\u2014\nFirst, Because several of these faculties being exercised at first\nprincipally about simple ideas, we might, by following nature in its\nordinary method, trace and discover them, in their rise, progress, and\ngradual improvements.\nSecondly, Because observing the faculties of the mind, how they operate\nabout simple ideas,\u2014which are usually, in most men\u2019s minds, much more\nclear, precise, and distinct than complex ones,\u2014we may the better\nexamine and learn how the mind extracts, denominates, compares, and\nexercises, in its other operations about those which are complex,\nwherein we are much more liable to mistake. Thirdly, Because these very\noperations of the mind about ideas received from sensations, are\nthemselves, when reflected on, another set of ideas, derived from that\nother source of our knowledge, which I call reflection; and therefore\nfit to be considered in this place after the simple ideas of sensation.\nOf compounding, comparing, abstracting, &c., I have but just spoken,\nhaving occasion to treat of them more at large in other places.\n15. The true Beginning of Human Knowledge.\nAnd thus I have given a short, and, I think, true HISTORY OF THE FIRST\nBEGINNINGS OF HUMAN KNOWLEDGE;\u2014whence the mind has its first objects;\nand by what steps it makes its progress to the laying in and storing up\nthose ideas, out of which is to be framed all the knowledge it is\ncapable of: wherein I must appeal to experience and observation whether\nI am in the right: the best way to come to truth being to examine\nthings as really they are, and not to conclude they are, as we fancy of\nourselves, or have been taught by others to imagine.\n16. Appeal to Experience.\nTo deal truly, this is the only way that I can discover, whereby the\nIDEAS OF THINGS are brought into the understanding. If other men have\neither innate ideas or infused principles, they have reason to enjoy\nthem; and if they are sure of it, it is impossible for others to deny\nthem the privilege that they have above their neighbours. I can speak\nbut of what I find in myself, and is agreeable to those notions, which,\nif we will examine the whole course of men in their several ages,\ncountries, and educations, seem to depend on those foundations which I\nhave laid, and to correspond with this method in all the parts and\ndegrees thereof.\n17. Dark Room.\nI pretend not to teach, but to inquire; and therefore cannot but\nconfess here again,\u2014that external and internal sensation are the only\npassages I can find of knowledge to the understanding. These alone, as\nfar as I can discover, are the windows by which light is let into this\nDARK ROOM. For, methinks, the understanding is not much unlike a closet\nwholly shut from light, with only some little openings left, to let in\nexternal visible resemblances, or ideas of things without: which, would\nthey but stay there, and lie so orderly as to be found upon occasion,\nit would very much resemble the understanding of a man, in reference to\nall objects of sight, and the ideas of them.\nThese are my guesses concerning the means whereby the understanding\ncomes to have and retain simple ideas, and the modes of them, with some\nother operations about them.\nI proceed now to examine some of these simple ideas and their modes a\nlittle more particularly.\nCHAPTER XII.\nOF COMPLEX IDEAS.\n1. Made by the Mind out of simple Ones.\nWe have hitherto considered those ideas, in the reception whereof the\nmind is only passive, which are those simple ones received from\nsensation and reflection before mentioned, whereof the mind cannot make\none to itself, nor have any idea which does not wholly consist of them.\nAs simple ideas are observed to exist in several combinations united\ntogether, so the mind has a power to consider several of them united\ntogether as one idea; and that not only as they are united in external\nobjects, but as itself has joined them together. Ideas thus made up of\nseveral simple ones put together, I call COMPLEX;\u2014such as are beauty,\ngratitude, a man, an army, the universe; which, though complicated of\nvarious simple ideas, or complex ideas made up of simple ones, yet are,\nwhen the mind pleases, considered each by itself, as one entire thing,\nsignified by one name.\n2. Made voluntarily.\nIn this faculty of repeating and joining together its ideas, the mind\nhas great power in varying and multiplying the objects of its thoughts,\ninfinitely beyond what sensation or reflection furnished it with: but\nall this still confined to those simple ideas which it received from\nthose two sources, and which are the ultimate materials of all its\ncompositions. For simple ideas are all from things themselves, and of\nthese the mind CAN have no more, nor other than what are suggested to\nit. It can have no other ideas of sensible qualities than what come\nfrom without [*dropped word] the senses; nor any ideas of other kind of\noperations of a thinking substance, than what it finds in itself. But\nwhen it has once got these simple ideas, it is not confined barely to\nobservation, and what offers itself from without; it can, by its own\npower, put together those ideas it has, and make new complex ones,\nwhich it never received so united.\n3. Complex ideas are either of Modes, Substances, or Relations.\nCOMPLEX IDEAS, however compounded and decompounded, though their number\nbe infinite, and the variety endless, wherewith they fill and entertain\nthe thoughts of men; yet I think they may be all reduced under these\nthree heads:\u20141. MODES. 2. SUBSTANCES. 3. RELATIONS.\n4. Ideas of Modes.\nFirst, MODES I call such complex ideas which, however compounded,\ncontain not in them the supposition of subsisting by themselves, but\nare considered as dependences on, or affections of substances;\u2014such as\nare the ideas signified by the words triangle, gratitude, murder, &c.\nAnd if in this I use the word mode in somewhat a different sense from\nits ordinary signification, I beg pardon; it being unavoidable in\ndiscourses, differing from the ordinary received notions, either to\nmake new words, or to use old words in somewhat a new signification;\nthe later whereof, in our present case, is perhaps the more tolerable\nof the two.\n5. Simple and mixed Modes of Ideas.\nOf these MODES, there are two sorts which deserve distinct\nconsideration:\u2014\nFirst, there are some which are only variations, or different\ncombinations of the same simple idea, without the mixture of any\nother;\u2014as a dozen, or score; which are nothing but the ideas of so many\ndistinct units added together, and these I call SIMPLE MODES as being\ncontained within the bounds of one simple idea.\nSecondly, there are others compounded of simple ideas of several kinds,\nput together to make one complex one;\u2014v.g. beauty, consisting of a\ncertain composition of colour and figure, causing delight to the\nbeholder; theft, which being the concealed change of the possession of\nanything, without the consent of the proprietor, contains, as is\nvisible, a combination of several ideas of several kinds: and these I\ncall MIXED MODES.\n6. Ideas of Substances, single or collective.\nSecondly, the ideas of SUBSTANCES are such combinations of simple ideas\nas are taken to represent distinct PARTICULAR things subsisting by\nthemselves; in which the supposed or confused idea of substance, such\nas it is, is always the first and chief. Thus if to substance be joined\nthe simple idea of a certain dull whitish colour, with certain degrees\nof weight, hardness, ductility, and fusibility, we have the idea of\nlead; and a combination of the ideas of a certain sort of figure, with\nthe powers of motion, thought and reasoning, joined to substance, make\nthe ordinary idea of a man. Now of substances also, there are two sorts\nof ideas:\u2014one of SINGLE substances, as they exist separately, as of a\nman or a sheep; the other of several of those put together, as an army\nof men, or flock of sheep\u2014which COLLECTIVE ideas of several substances\nthus put together are as much each of them one single idea as that of a\nman or an unit.\n7. Ideas of Relation.\nThirdly, the last sort of complex ideas is that we call RELATION, which\nconsists in the consideration and comparing one idea with another.\nOf these several kinds we shall treat in their order.\n8. The abstrusest Ideas we can have are all from two Sources.\nIf we trace the progress of our minds, and with attention observe how\nit repeats, adds together, and unites its simple ideas received from\nsensation or reflection, it will lead us further than at first perhaps\nwe should have imagined. And, I believe, we shall find, if we warily\nobserve the originals of our notions, that EVEN THE MOST ABSTRUSE\nIDEAS, how remote soever they may seem from sense, or from any\noperations of our own minds, are yet only such as the understanding\nframes to itself, by repeating and joining together ideas that it had\neither from objects of sense, or from its own operations about them: so\nthat those even large and abstract ideas are derived from sensation or\nreflection, being no other than what the mind, by the ordinary use of\nits own faculties, employed about ideas received from objects of sense,\nor from the operations it observes in itself about them, may, and does,\nattain unto.\nThis I shall endeavour to show in the ideas we have of space, time, and\ninfinity, and some few others that seem the most remote, from those\noriginals.\nCHAPTER XIII.\nCOMPLEX IDEAS OF SIMPLE MODES:\u2014AND FIRST, OF THE SIMPLE MODES OF IDEA\nOF SPACE.\n1. Simple modes of simple ideas.\nThough in the foregoing part I have often mentioned simple ideas, which\nare truly the materials of all our knowledge; yet having treated of\nthem there, rather in the way that they come into the mind, than as\ndistinguished from others more compounded, it will not be perhaps amiss\nto take a view of some of them again under this consideration, and\nexamine those different modifications of the SAME idea; which the mind\neither finds in things existing, or is able to make within itself\nwithout the help of any extrinsical object, or any foreign suggestion.\nThose modifications of any ONE simple idea (which, as has been said, I\ncall SIMPLE MODES) are as perfectly different and distinct ideas in the\nmind as those of the greatest distance or contrariety. For the idea of\ntwo is as distinct from that of one, as blueness from heat, or either\nof them from any number: and yet it is made up only of that simple idea\nof an unit repeated; and repetitions of this kind joined together make\nthose distinct simple modes, of a dozen, a gross, a million. Simple\nModes of Idea of Space.\n2. Idea of Space.\nI shall begin with the simple idea of SPACE. I have showed above, chap.\n4, that we get the idea of space, both by our sight and touch; which, I\nthink, is so evident, that it would be as needless to go to prove that\nmen perceive, by their sight, a distance between bodies of different\ncolours, or between the parts of the same body, as that they see\ncolours themselves: nor is it less obvious, that they can do so in the\ndark by feeling and touch.\n3. Space and Extension.\nThis space, considered barely in length between any two beings, without\nconsidering anything else between them, is called DISTANCE: if\nconsidered in length, breadth, and thickness, I think it may be called\nCAPACITY. When considered between the extremities of matter, which\nfills the capacity of space with something solid, tangible, and\nmoveable, it is properly called EXTENSION. And so extension is an idea\nbelonging to body only; but space may, as is evident, be considered\nwithout it. At least I think it most intelligible, and the best way to\navoid confusion, if we use the word extension for an affection of\nmatter or the distance of the extremities of particular solid bodies;\nand space in the more general signification, for distance, with or\nwithout solid matter possessing it.\n4. Immensity.\nEach different distance is a different modification of space; and each\nidea of any different distance, or space, is a SIMPLE MODE of this\nidea. Men having, by accustoming themselves to stated lengths of space,\nwhich they use for measuring other distances\u2014as a foot, a yard or a\nfathom, a league, or diameter of the earth\u2014made those ideas familiar to\ntheir thoughts, can, in their minds, repeat them as often as they will,\nwithout mixing or joining to them the idea of body, or anything else;\nand frame to themselves the ideas of long, square, or cubic feet, yards\nor fathoms, here amongst the bodies of the universe, or else beyond the\nutmost bounds of all bodies; and, by adding these still one to another,\nenlarge their ideas of space as much as they please. The power of\nrepeating or doubling any idea we have of any distance, and adding it\nto the former as often as we will, without being ever able to come to\nany stop or stint, let us enlarge it as much as we will, is that which\ngives us the idea of IMMENSITY.\n5. Figure.\nThere is another modification of this idea, which is nothing but the\nrelation which the parts of the termination of extension, or\ncircumscribed space, have amongst themselves. This the touch discovers\nin sensible bodies, whose extremities come within our reach; and the\neye takes both from bodies and colours, whose boundaries are within its\nview: where, observing how the extremities terminate,\u2014either in\nstraight lines which meet at discernible angles, or in crooked lines\nwherein no angles can be perceived; by considering these as they relate\nto one another, in all parts of the extremities of any body or space,\nit has that idea we call FIGURE, which affords to the mind infinite\nvariety. For, besides the vast number of different figures that do\nreally exist in the coherent masses of matter, the stock that the mind\nhas in its power, by varying the idea of space, and thereby making\nstill new compositions, by repeating its own ideas, and joining them as\nit pleases, is perfectly inexhaustible. And so it can multiply figures\nIN INFINITUM.\n6. Endless variety of figures.\nFor the mind having a power to repeat the idea of any length directly\nstretched out, and join it to another in the same direction, which is\nto double the length of that straight line; or else join another with\nwhat inclination it thinks fit, and so make what sort of angle it\npleases: and being able also to shorten any line it imagines, by taking\nfrom it one half, one fourth, or what part it pleases, without being\nable to come to an end of any such divisions, it can make an angle of\nany bigness. So also the lines that are its sides, of what length it\npleases, which joining again to other lines, of different lengths, and\nat different angles, till it has wholly enclosed any space, it is\nevident that it can multiply figures, both in their shape and capacity,\nIN INFINITUM; all which are but so many different simple modes of\nspace.\nThe same that it can do with straight lines, it can also do with\ncrooked, or crooked and straight together; and the same it can do in\nlines, it can also in superficies; by which we may be led into farther\nthoughts of the endless variety of figures that the mind has a power to\nmake, and thereby to multiply the simple modes of space.\n7. Place.\nAnother idea coming under this head, and belonging to this tribe, is\nthat we call PLACE. As in simple space, we consider the relation of\ndistance between any two bodies or points; so in our idea of place, we\nconsider the relation of distance betwixt anything, and any two or more\npoints, which are considered as keeping the same distance one with\nanother, and so considered as at rest. For when we find anything at the\nsame distance now which it was yesterday, from any two or more points,\nwhich have not since changed their distance one with another, and with\nwhich we then compared it, we say it hath kept the same place: but if\nit hath sensibly altered its distance with either of those points, we\nsay it hath changed its place: though, vulgarly speaking, in the common\nnotion of place, we do not always exactly observe the distance from\nthese precise points, but from larger portions of sensible objects, to\nwhich we consider the thing placed to bear relation, and its distance\nfrom which we have some reason to observe.\n8. Place relative to particular bodies.\nThus, a company of chess-men, standing on the same squares of the\nchess-board where we left them, we say they are all in the SAME place,\nor unmoved, though perhaps the chessboard hath been in the mean time\ncarried out of one room into another; because we compared them only to\nthe parts of the chess-board, which keep the same distance one with\nanother. The chess-board, we also say, is in the same place it was, if\nit remain in the same part of the cabin, though perhaps the ship which\nit is in sails all the while. And the ship is said to be in the same\nplace, supposing it kept the same distance with the parts of the\nneighbouring land; though perhaps the earth hath turned round, and so\nboth chess-men, and board, and ship, have every one changed place, in\nrespect of remoter bodies, which have kept the same distance one with\nanother. But yet the distance from certain parts of the board being\nthat which determines the place of the chess-men; and the distance from\nthe fixed parts of the cabin (with which we made the comparison) being\nthat which determined the place of the chess-board; and the fixed parts\nof the earth that by which we determined the place of the ship,\u2014these\nthings may be said to be in the same place in those respects: though\ntheir distance from some other things, which in this matter we did not\nconsider, being varied, they have undoubtedly changed place in that\nrespect; and we ourselves shall think so, when we have occasion to\ncompare them with those other.\n9. Place relative to a present purpose.\nBut this modification of distance we call place, being made by men for\ntheir common use, that by it they might be able to design the\nparticular position of things, where they had occasion for such\ndesignation; men consider and determine of this place by reference to\nthose adjacent things which best served to their present purpose,\nwithout considering other things which, to another purpose, would\nbetter determine the place of the same thing. Thus in the chess-board,\nthe use of the designation of the place of each chess-man being\ndetermined only within that chequered piece of wood, it would cross\nthat purpose to measure it by anything else; but when these very\nchess-men are put up in a bag, if any one should ask where the black\nking is, it would be proper to determine the place by the part of the\nroom it was in, and not by the chessboard; there being another use of\ndesigning the place it is now in, than when in play it was on the\nchessboard, and so must be determined by other bodies. So if any one\nshould ask, in what place are the verses which report the story of\nNisus and Euryalus, it would be very improper to determine this place,\nby saying, they were in such a part of the earth, or in Bodley\u2019s\nlibrary: but the right designation of the place would be by the parts\nof Virgil\u2019s works; and the proper answer would be, that these verses\nwere about the middle of the ninth book of his AEneids, and that they\nhave been always constantly in the same place ever since Virgil was\nprinted: which is true, though the book itself hath moved a thousand\ntimes, the use of the idea of place here being, to know in what part of\nthe book that story is, that so, upon occasion, we may know where to\nfind it, and have recourse to it for use.\n10. Place of the universe.\nThat our idea of place is nothing else but such a relative position of\nanything as I have before mentioned, I think is plain, and will be\neasily admitted, when we consider that we can have no idea of the place\nof the universe, though we can of all the parts of it; because beyond\nthat we have not the idea of any fixed, distinct, particular beings, in\nreference to which we can imagine it to have any relation of distance;\nbut all beyond it is one uniform space or expansion, wherein the mind\nfinds no variety, no marks. For to say that the world is somewhere,\nmeans no more than that it does exist; this, though a phrase borrowed\nfrom place, signifying only its existence, not location: and when one\ncan find out, and frame in his mind, clearly and distinctly the place\nof the universe, he will be able to tell us whether it moves or stands\nstill in the undistinguishable inane of infinite space: though it be\ntrue that the word place has sometimes a more confused sense, and\nstands for that space which anybody takes up; and so the universe is in\na place. The idea, therefore, of place we have by the same means that\nwe get the idea of space, (whereof this is but a particular limited\nconsideration,) viz. by our sight and touch; by either of which we\nreceive into our minds the ideas of extension or distance.\n11. Extension and Body not the same.\nThere are some that would persuade us, that body and extension are the\nsame thing, who either change the signification of words, which I would\nnot suspect them of,\u2014they having so severely condemned the philosophy\nof others, because it hath been too much placed in the uncertain\nmeaning, or deceitful obscurity of doubtful or insignificant terms. If,\ntherefore, they mean by body and extension the same that other people\ndo, viz. by BODY something that is solid and extended, whose parts are\nseparable and movable different ways; and by EXTENSION, only the space\nthat lies between the extremities of those solid coherent parts, and\nwhich is possessed by them,\u2014they confound very different ideas one with\nanother; for I appeal to every man\u2019s own thoughts, whether the idea of\nspace be not as distinct from that of solidity, as it is from the idea\nof scarlet colour? It is true, solidity cannot exist without extension,\nneither can scarlet colour exist without extension, but this hinders\nnot, but that they are distinct ideas. Many ideas require others, as\nnecessary to their existence or conception, which yet are very distinct\nideas. Motion can neither be, nor be conceived, without space; and yet\nmotion is not space, nor space motion; space can exist without it, and\nthey are very distinct ideas; and so, I think, are those of space and\nsolidity. Solidity is so inseparable an idea from body, that upon that\ndepends its filling of space, its contact, impulse, and communication\nof motion upon impulse. And if it be a reason to prove that spirit is\ndifferent from body, because thinking includes not the idea of\nextension in it; the same reason will be as valid, I suppose, to prove\nthat space is not body, because it includes not the idea of solidity in\nit; SPACE and SOLIDITY being as distinct ideas as THINKING and\nEXTENSION, and as wholly separable in the mind one from another. Body\nthen and extension, it is evident, are two distinct ideas. For,\n12. Extension not solidity.\nFirst, Extension includes no solidity, nor resistance to the motion of\nbody, as body does.\n13. The parts of space inseparable, both really and mentally.\nSecondly, The parts of pure space are inseparable one from the other;\nso that the continuity cannot be separated, both neither really nor\nmentally. For I demand of any one to remove any part of it from\nanother, with which it is continued, even so much as in thought. To\ndivide and separate actually is, as I think, by removing the parts one\nfrom another, to make two superficies, where before there was a\ncontinuity: and to divide mentally is, to make in the mind two\nsuperficies, where before there was a continuity, and consider them as\nremoved one from the other; which can only be done in things considered\nby the mind as capable of being separated; and by separation, of\nacquiring new distinct superficies, which they then have not, but are\ncapable of. But neither of these ways of separation, whether real or\nmental, is, as I think, compatible to pure space.\nIt is true, a man may consider so much of such a space as is answerable\nor commensurate to a foot, without considering the rest, which is,\nindeed, a partial consideration, but not so much as mental separation\nor division; since a man can no more mentally divide, without\nconsidering two superficies separate one from the other, than he can\nactually divide, without making two superficies disjoined one from the\nother: but a partial consideration is not separating. A man may\nconsider light in the sun without its heat, or mobility in body without\nits extension, without thinking of their separation. One is only a\npartial consideration, terminating in one alone; and the other is a\nconsideration of both, as existing separately.\n14. The parts of space immovable.\nThirdly, The parts of pure space are immovable, which follows from\ntheir inseparability; motion being nothing but change of distance\nbetween any two things; but this cannot be between parts that are\ninseparable, which, therefore, must needs be at perpetual rest one\namongst another.\nThus the determined idea of simple space distinguishes it plainly and\nsufficiently from body; since its parts are inseparable, immovable, and\nwithout resistance to the motion of body.\n15. The Definition of Extension explains it not.\nIf any one ask me WHAT this space I speak of IS, I will tell him when\nhe tells me what his extension is. For to say, as is usually done, that\nextension is to have partes extra partes, is to say only, that\nextension is extension. For what am I the better informed in the nature\nof extension, when I am told that extension is to have parts that are\nextended, exterior to parts that are extended, i. e. extension consists\nof extended parts? As if one, asking what a fibre was, I should answer\nhim,\u2014that it was a thing made up of several fibres. Would he thereby be\nenabled to understand what a fibre was better than he did before? Or\nrather, would he not have reason to think that my design was to make\nsport with him, rather than seriously to instruct him?\n16. Division of Beings into Bodies and Spirits proves not Space and\nBody the same.\nThose who contend that space and body are the same, bring this\ndilemma:\u2014either this space is something or nothing; if nothing be\nbetween two bodies, they must necessarily touch; if it be allowed to be\nsomething, they ask, Whether it be body or spirit? To which I answer by\nanother question, Who told them that there was, or could be, nothing;\nbut SOLID BEINGS, WHICH COULD NOT THINK, and THINKING BEINGS THAT WERE\nNOT EXTENDED?\u2014which is all they mean by the terms BODY and SPIRIT.\n17. Substance, which we know not, no Proof against Space without Body.\nIf it be demanded (as usually it is) whether this space, void of body,\nbe SUBSTANCE or ACCIDENT, I shall readily answer I know not; nor shall\nbe ashamed to own my ignorance, till they that ask show me a clear\ndistinct idea of substance.\n18. Different meanings of substance.\nI endeavour as much as I can to deliver myself from those fallacies\nwhich we are apt to put upon ourselves, by taking words for things. It\nhelps not our ignorance to feign a knowledge where we have none, by\nmaking a noise with sounds, without clear and distinct significations.\nNames made at pleasure, neither alter the nature of things, nor make us\nunderstand them, but as they are signs of and stand for determined\nideas. And I desire those who lay so much stress on the sound of these\ntwo syllables, SUBSTANCE, to consider whether applying it, as they do,\nto the infinite, incomprehensible God, to finite spirits, and to body,\nit be in the same sense; and whether it stands for the same idea, when\neach of those three so different beings are called substances. If so,\nwhether it will thence follow\u2014that God, spirits, and body, agreeing in\nthe same common nature of substance, differ not any otherwise than in a\nbare different MODIFICATION of that substance; as a tree and a pebble,\nbeing in the same sense body, and agreeing in the common nature of\nbody, differ only in a bare modification of that common matter, which\nwill be a very harsh doctrine. If they say, that they apply it to God,\nfinite spirit, and matter, in three different significations and that\nit stands for one idea when God is said to be a substance; for another\nwhen the soul is called substance; and for a third when body is called\nso;\u2014if the name substance stands for three several distinct ideas, they\nwould do well to make known those distinct ideas, or at least to give\nthree distinct names to them, to prevent in so important a notion the\nconfusion and errors that will naturally follow from the promiscuous\nuse of so doubtful a term; which is so far from being suspected to have\nthree distinct, that in ordinary use it has scarce one clear distinct\nsignification. And if they can thus make three distinct ideas of\nsubstance, what hinders why another may not make a fourth?\n19. Substance and accidents of little use in Philosophy.\nThey who first ran into the notion of ACCIDENTS, as a sort of real\nbeings that needed something to inhere in, were forced to find out the\nword SUBSTANCE to support them. Had the poor Indian philosopher (who\nimagined that the earth also wanted something to bear it up) but\nthought of this word substance, he needed not to have been at the\ntrouble to find an elephant to support it, and a tortoise to support\nhis elephant: the word substance would have done it effectually. And he\nthat inquired might have taken it for as good an answer from an Indian\nphilosopher,\u2014that substance, without knowing what it is, is that which\nsupports the earth, as take it for a sufficient answer and good\ndoctrine from our European philosophers,\u2014that substance, without\nknowing what it is, is that which supports accidents. So that of\nsubstance, we have no idea of what it is, but only a confused obscure\none of what it does.\n20. Sticking on and under-propping.\nWhatever a learned man may do here, an intelligent American, who\ninquired into the nature of things, would scarce take it for a\nsatisfactory account, if, desiring to learn our architecture, he should\nbe told that a pillar is a thing supported by a basis, and a basis\nsomething that supported a pillar. Would he not think himself mocked,\ninstead of taught, with such an account as this? And a stranger to them\nwould be very liberally instructed in the nature of books, and the\nthings they contained, if he should be told that all learned books\nconsisted of paper and letters, and that letters were things inhering\nin paper, and paper a thing that held forth letters: a notable way of\nhaving clear ideas of letters and paper. But were the Latin words,\ninhaerentia and substantio, put into the plain English ones that answer\nthem, and were called STICKING ON and UNDER-PROPPING, they would better\ndiscover to us the very great clearness there is in the doctrine of\nsubstance and accidents, and show of what use they are in deciding of\nquestions in philosophy.\n21. A Vacuum beyond the utmost Bounds of Body.\nBut to return to our idea of space. If body be not supposed infinite,\n(which I think no one will affirm,) I would ask, whether, if God placed\na man at the extremity of corporeal beings, he could not stretch his\nhand beyond his body? If he could, then he would put his arm where\nthere was before space without body; and if there he spread his\nfingers, there would still be space between them without body. If he\ncould not stretch out his hand, it must be because of some external\nhindrance; (for we suppose him alive, with such a power of moving the\nparts of his body that he hath now, which is not in itself impossible,\nif God so pleased to have it; or at least it is not impossible for God\nso to move him:) and then I ask,\u2014whether that which hinders his hand\nfrom moving outwards be substance or accident, something or nothing?\nAnd when they have resolved that, they will be able to resolve\nthemselves,\u2014what that is, which is or may be between two bodies at a\ndistance, that is not body, and has no solidity. In the mean time, the\nargument is at least as good, that, where nothing hinders, (as beyond\nthe utmost bounds of all bodies,) a body put in motion may move on, as\nwhere there is nothing between, there two bodies must necessarily\ntouch. For pure space between is sufficient to take away the necessity\nof mutual contact; but bare space in the way is not sufficient to stop\nmotion. The truth is, these men must either own that they think body\ninfinite, though they are loth to speak it out, or else affirm that\nspace is not body. For I would fain meet with that thinking man that\ncan in his thoughts set any bounds to space, more than he can to\nduration; or by thinking hope to arrive at the end of either. And\ntherefore, if his idea of eternity be infinite, so is his idea of\nimmensity; they are both finite or infinite alike.\n22. The Power of Annihilation proves a Vacuum.\nFarther, those who assert the impossibility of space existing without\nmatter, must not only make body infinite, but must also deny a power in\nGod to annihilate any part of matter. No one, I suppose, will deny that\nGod can put an end to all motion that is in matter, and fix all the\nbodies of the universe in a perfect quiet and rest, and continue them\nso long as he pleases. Whoever then will allow that God can, during\nsuch a general rest, ANNIHILATE either this book or the body of him\nthat reads it, must necessarily admit the possibility of a vacuum. For,\nit is evident that the space that was filled by the parts of the\nannihilated body will still remain, and be a space without body. For\nthe circumambient bodies being in perfect rest, are a wall of adamant,\nand in that state make it a perfect impossibility for any other body to\nget into that space. And indeed the necessary motion of one particle of\nmatter into the place from whence another particle of matter is\nremoved, is but a consequence from the supposition of plenitude; which\nwill therefore need some better proof than a supposed matter of fact,\nwhich experiment can never make out;\u2014our own clear and distinct ideas\nplainly satisfying that there is no necessary connexion between space\nand solidity, since we can conceive the one without the other. And\nthose who dispute for or against a vacuum, do thereby confess they have\ndistinct IDEAS of vacuum and plenum, i. e. that they have an idea of\nextension void of solidity, though they deny its EXISTENCE; or else\nthey dispute about nothing at all. For they who so much alter the\nsignification of words, as to call extension body, and consequently\nmake the whole essence of body to be nothing but pure extension without\nsolidity, must talk absurdly whenever they speak of vacuum; since it is\nimpossible for extension to be without extension. For vacuum, whether\nwe affirm or deny its existence, signifies space without body; whose\nvery existence no one can deny to be possible, who will not make matter\ninfinite, and take from God a power to annihilate any particle of it.\n23. Motion proves a Vacuum.\nBut not to go so far as beyond the utmost bounds of body in the\nuniverse, nor appeal to God\u2019s omnipotency to find a vacuum, the motion\nof bodies that are in our view and neighbourhood seems to me plainly to\nevince it. For I desire any one so to divide a solid body, of any\ndimension he pleases, as to make it possible for the solid parts to\nmove up and down freely every way within the bounds of that\nsuperficies, if there be not left in it a void space as big as the\nleast part into which he has divided the said solid body. And if, where\nthe least particle of the body divided is as big as a mustard-seed, a\nvoid space equal to the bulk of a mustard-seed be requisite to make\nroom for the free motion of the parts of the divided body within the\nbounds of its superficies, where the particles of matter are\n100,000,000 less than a mustard-seed, there must also be a space void\nof solid matter as big as 100,000,000 part of a mustard-seed; for if it\nhold in the one it will hold in the other, and so on IN INFINITUM. And\nlet this void space be as little as it will, it destroys the hypothesis\nof plenitude. For if there can be a space void of body equal to the\nsmallest separate particle of matter now existing in nature, it is\nstill space without body; and makes as great a difference between space\nand body as if it were mega chasma, a distance as wide as any in\nnature. And therefore, if we suppose not the void space necessary to\nmotion equal to the least parcel of the divided solid matter, but to\n1/10 or 1/1000 of it, the same consequence will always follow of space\nwithout matter.\n24. The Ideas of Space and Body distinct.\nBut the question being here,\u2014Whether the idea of space or extension be\nthe same with the idea of body? it is not necessary to prove the real\nexistence of a VACUUM, but the idea of it; which it is plain men have\nwhen they inquire and dispute whether there be a VACUUM or no. For if\nthey had not the idea of space without body, they could not make a\nquestion about its existence: and if their idea of body did not include\nin it something more than the bare idea of space, they could have no\ndoubt about the plenitude of the world; and it would be as absurd to\ndemand, whether there were space without body, as whether there were\nspace without space, or body without body, since these were but\ndifferent names of the same idea.\n25. Extension being inseparable from Body, proves it not the same.\nIt is true, the idea of extension joins itself so inseparably with all\nvisible, and most tangible qualities, that it suffers us to SEE no one,\nor FEEL very few external objects, without taking in impressions of\nextension too. This readiness of extension to make itself be taken\nnotice of so constantly with other ideas, has been the occasion, I\nguess, that some have made the whole essence of body to consist in\nextension; which is not much to be wondered at, since some have had\ntheir minds, by their eyes and touch, (the busiest of all our senses,)\nso filled with the idea of extension, and, as it were, wholly possessed\nwith it, that they allowed no existence to anything that had not\nextension. I shall not now argue with those men, who take the measure\nand possibility of all being only from their narrow and gross\nimaginations: but having here to do only with those who conclude the\nessence of body to be extension, because they say they cannot imagine\nany sensible quality of any body without extension,\u2014I shall desire them\nto consider, that, had they reflected on their ideas of tastes and\nsmells as much as on those of sight and touch; nay, had they examined\ntheir ideas of hunger and thirst, and several other pains, they would\nhave found that THEY included in them no idea of extension at all,\nwhich is but an affection of body, as well as the rest, discoverable by\nour senses, which are scarce acute enough to look into the pure\nessences of things.\n26. Essences of Things.\nIf those ideas which are constantly joined to all others, must\ntherefore be concluded to be the essence of those things which have\nconstantly those ideas joined to them, and are inseparable from them;\nthen unity is without doubt the essence of everything. For there is not\nany object of sensation or reflection which does not carry with it the\nidea of one: but the weakness of this kind of argument we have already\nshown sufficiently.\n27. Ideas of Space and Solidity distinct.\nTo conclude: whatever men shall think concerning the existence of a\nVACUUM, this is plain to me\u2014that we have as clear an idea of space\ndistinct from solidity, as we have of solidity distinct from motion, or\nmotion from space. We have not any two more distinct ideas; and we can\nas easily conceive space without solidity, as we can conceive body or\nspace without motion, though it be never so certain that neither body\nnor motion can exist without space. But whether any one will take space\nto be only a RELATION resulting from the existence of other beings at a\ndistance; or whether they will think the words of the most knowing King\nSolomon, \u2018The heaven, and the heaven of heavens, cannot contain thee;\u2019\nor those more emphatical ones of the inspired philosopher St. Paul, \u2018In\nhim we live, move, and have our being,\u2019 are to be understood in a\nliteral sense, I leave every one to consider: only our idea of space\nis, I think, such as I have mentioned, and distinct from that of body.\nFor, whether we consider, in matter itself, the distance of its\ncoherent solid parts, and call it, in respect of those solid parts,\nextension; or whether, considering it as lying between the extremities\nof any body in its several dimensions, we call it length, breadth, and\nthickness; or else, considering it as lying between any two bodies or\npositive beings, without any consideration whether there be any matter\nor not between, we call it distance;\u2014however named or considered, it is\nalways the same uniform simple idea of space, taken from objects about\nwhich our senses have been conversant; whereof, having settled ideas in\nour minds, we can revive, repeat, and add them one to another as often\nas we will, and consider the space or distance so imagined, either as\nfilled with solid parts, so that another body cannot come there without\ndisplacing and thrusting out the body that was there before; or else as\nvoid of solidity, so that a body of equal dimensions to that empty or\npure space may be placed in it, without the removing or expulsion of\nanything that was there.\n28. Men differ little in clear, simple ideas.\nThe knowing precisely what our words stand for, would, I imagine, in\nthis as well as a great many other cases, quickly end the dispute. For\nI am apt to think that men, when they come to examine them, find their\nsimple ideas all generally to agree, though in discourse with one\nanother they perhaps confound one another with different names. I\nimagine that men who abstract their thoughts, and do well examine the\nideas of their own minds, cannot much differ in thinking; however they\nmay perplex themselves with words, according to the way of speaking of\nthe several schools or sects they have been bred up in: though amongst\nunthinking men, who examine not scrupulously and carefully their own\nideas, and strip them not from the marks men use for them, but confound\nthem with words, there must be endless dispute, wrangling, and jargon;\nespecially if they be learned, bookish men, devoted to some sect, and\naccustomed to the language of it, and have learned to talk after\nothers. But if it should happen that any two thinking men should really\nhave different ideas, I do not see how they could discourse or argue\none with another. Here I must not be mistaken, to think that every\nfloating imagination in men\u2019s brains is presently of that sort of ideas\nI speak of. It is not easy for the mind to put off those confused\nnotions and prejudices it has imbibed from custom, inadvertency, and\ncommon conversation. It requires pains and assiduity to examine its\nideas, till it resolves them into those clear and distinct simple ones,\nout of which they are compounded; and to see which, amongst its simple\nones, have or have not a NECESSARY connexion and dependence one upon\nanother. Till a man doth this in the primary and original notions of\nthings, he builds upon floating and uncertain principles, and will\noften find himself at a loss.\nCHAPTER XIV.\nIDEA OF DURATION AND ITS SIMPLE MODES.\n1. Duration is fleeting Extension.\nThere is another sort of distance, or length, the idea whereof we get\nnot from the permanent parts of space, but from the fleeting and\nperpetually perishing parts of succession. This we call DURATION; the\nsimple modes whereof are any different lengths of it whereof we have\ndistinct ideas, as HOURS, DAYS, YEARS, &c., TIME and ETERNITY.\n2. Its Idea from Reflection on the Train of our Ideas.\nThe answer of a great man, to one who asked what time was: Si non rogas\nintelligo, (which amounts to this; The more I set myself to think of\nit, the less I understand it,) might perhaps persuade one that time,\nwhich reveals all other things, is itself not to be discovered.\nDuration, time, and eternity, are, not without reason, thought to have\nsomething very abstruse in their nature. But however remote these may\nseem from our comprehension, yet if we trace them right to their\noriginals, I doubt not but one of those sources of all our knowledge,\nviz. sensation and reflection, will be able to furnish us with these\nideas, as clear and distinct as many others which are thought much less\nobscure; and we shall find that the idea of eternity itself is derived\nfrom the same common original with the rest of our ideas.\n3. Nature and origin of the idea of Duration.\nTo understand TIME and ETERNITY aright, we ought with attention to\nconsider what idea it is we have of DURATION, and how we came by it. It\nis evident to any one who will but observe what passes in his own mind,\nthat there is a train of ideas which constantly succeed one another in\nhis understanding, as long as he is awake. Reflection on these\nappearances of several ideas one after another in our minds, is that\nwhich furnishes us with the idea of SUCCESSION: and the distance\nbetween any parts of that succession, or between the appearance of any\ntwo ideas in our minds, is that we call DURATION. For whilst we are\nthinking, or whilst we receive successively several ideas in our minds,\nwe know that we do exist; and so we call the existence, or the\ncontinuation of the existence of ourselves, or anything else,\ncommensurate to the succession of any ideas in our minds, the duration\nof ourselves, or any such other thing co-existent with our thinking.\n4. Proof that its idea is got from reflection on the train of our\nideas.\nThat we have our notion of succession and duration from this original,\nviz. from reflection on the train of ideas, which we find to appear one\nafter another in our own minds, seems plain to me, in that we have no\nperception of duration but by considering the train of ideas that take\ntheir turns in our understandings. When that succession of ideas\nceases, our perception of duration ceases with it; which every one\nclearly experiments in himself, whilst he sleeps soundly, whether an\nhour or a day, a month or a year; of which duration of things, while he\nsleeps or thinks not, he has no perception at all, but it is quite lost\nto him; and the moment wherein he leaves off to think, till the moment\nhe begins to think again, seems to him to have no distance. And so I\ndoubt not it would be to a waking man, if it were possible for him to\nkeep ONLY ONE idea in his mind, without variation and the succession of\nothers. And we see, that one who fixes his thoughts very intently on\none thing, so as to take but little notice of the succession of ideas\nthat pass in his mind whilst he is taken up with that earnest\ncontemplation, lets slip out of his account a good part of that\nduration, and thinks that time shorter than it is. But if sleep\ncommonly unites the distant parts of duration, it is because during\nthat time we have no succession of ideas in our minds. For if a man,\nduring his sleep, dreams, and variety of ideas make themselves\nperceptible in his mind one after another, he hath then, during such\ndreaming, a sense of duration, and of the length of it. By which it is\nto me very clear, that men derive their ideas of duration from their\nreflections on the train of the ideas they observe to succeed one\nanother in their own understandings; without which observation they can\nhave no notion of duration, whatever may happen in the world.\n5. The Idea of Duration applicable to Things whilst we sleep.\nIndeed a man having, from reflecting on the succession and number of\nhis own thoughts, got the notion or idea of duration, he can apply that\nnotion to things which exist while he does not think; as he that has\ngot the idea of extension from bodies by his sight or touch, can apply\nit to distances, where no body is seen or felt. And therefore, though a\nman has no perception of the length of duration which passed whilst he\nslept or thought not; yet, having observed the revolution of days and\nnights, and found the length of their duration to be in appearance\nregular and constant, he can, upon the supposition that that revolution\nhas proceeded after the same manner whilst he was asleep or thought\nnot, as it used to do at other times, he can, I say, imagine and make\nallowance for the length of duration whilst he slept. But if Adam and\nEve, (when they were alone in the world,) instead of their ordinary\nnight\u2019s sleep, had passed the whole twenty-four hours in one continued\nsleep, the duration of that twenty-four hours had been irrecoverably\nlost to them, and been for ever left out of their account of time.\n6. The Idea of Succession not from Motion.\nThus by reflecting on the appearing of various ideas one after another\nin our understandings, we get the notion of succession; which, if any\none should think we did rather get from our observation of motion by\nour senses, he will perhaps be of my mind when he considers, that even\nmotion produces in his mind an idea of succession no otherwise than as\nit produces there a continued train of distinguishable ideas. For a man\nlooking upon a body really moving, perceives yet no motion at all\nunless that motion produces a constant train of successive ideas: v.g.\na man becalmed at sea, out of sight of land, in a fair day, may look on\nthe sun, or sea, or ship, a whole hour together, and perceive no motion\nat all in either; though it be certain that two, and perhaps all of\nthem, have moved during that time a great way. But as soon as he\nperceives either of them to have changed distance with some other body,\nas soon as this motion produces any new idea in him, then he perceives\nthat there has been motion. But wherever a man is, with all things at\nrest about him, without perceiving any motion at all,\u2014if during this\nhour of quiet he has been thinking, he will perceive the various ideas\nof his own thoughts in his own mind, appearing one after another, and\nthereby observe and find succession where he could observe no motion.\n7. Very slow motions unperceived.\nAnd this, I think, is the reason why motions very slow, though they are\nconstant, are not perceived by us; because in their remove from one\nsensible part towards another, their change of distance is so slow,\nthat it causes no new ideas in us, but a good while one after another.\nAnd so not causing a constant train of new ideas to follow one another\nimmediately in our minds, we have no perception of motion; which\nconsisting in a constant succession, we cannot perceive that succession\nwithout a constant succession of varying ideas arising from it.\n8. Very swift motions unperceived.\nOn the contrary, things that move so swift as not to affect the senses\ndistinctly with several distinguishable distances of their motion, and\nso cause not any train of ideas in the mind, are not also perceived.\nFor anything that moves round about in a circle, in less times than our\nideas are wont to succeed one another in our minds, is not perceived to\nmove; but seems to be a perfect entire circle of the matter or colour,\nand not a part of a circle in motion.\n9. The Train of Ideas has a certain Degree of Quickness.\nHence I leave it to others to judge, whether it be not probable that\nour ideas do, whilst we are awake, succeed one another in our minds at\ncertain distances; not much unlike the images in the inside of a\nlantern, turned round by the heat of a candle. This appearance of\ntheirs in train, though perhaps it may be sometimes faster and\nsometimes slower, yet, I guess, varies not very much in a waking man:\nthere seem to be certain bounds to the quickness and slowness of the\nsuccession of those ideas one to another in our minds, beyond which\nthey can neither delay nor hasten.\n10. Real succession in swift motions without sense of succession.\nThe reason I have for this odd conjecture is, from observing that, in\nthe impressions made upon any of our senses, we can but to a certain\ndegree perceive any succession; which, if exceeding quick, the sense of\nsuccession is lost, even in cases where it is evident that there is a\nreal succession. Let a cannon-bullet pass through a room, and in its\nway take with it any limb, or fleshy parts of a man, it is as clear as\nany demonstration can be, that it must strike successively the two\nsides of the room: it is also evident, that it must touch one part of\nthe flesh first, and another after, and so in succession: and yet, I\nbelieve, nobody who ever felt the pain of such a shot, or heard the\nblow against the two distant walls, could perceive any succession\neither in the pain or sound of so swift a stroke. Such a part of\nduration as this, wherein we perceive no succession, is that which we\ncall an INSTANT, and is that which takes up the time of only one idea\nin our minds, without the succession of another; wherein, therefore, we\nperceive no succession at all.\n11. In slow motions.\nThis also happens where the motion is so slow as not to supply a\nconstant train of fresh ideas to the senses, as fast as the mind is\ncapable of receiving new ones into it; and so other ideas of our own\nthoughts, having room to come into our minds between those offered to\nour senses by the moving body, there the sense of motion is lost; and\nthe body, though it really moves, yet, not changing perceivable\ndistance with some other bodies as fast as the ideas of our own minds\ndo naturally follow one another in train, the thing seems to stand\nstill; as is evident in the hands of clocks, and shadows of sun-dials,\nand other constant but slow motions, where, though, after certain\nintervals, we perceive, by the change of distance, that it hath moved,\nyet the motion itself we perceive not.\n12. This Train, the Measure of other Successions.\nSo that to me it seems, that the constant and regular succession of\nIDEAS in a waking man, is, as it were, the measure and standard of all\nother successions. Whereof if any one either exceeds the pace of our\nideas, as where two sounds or pains, &c., take up in their succession\nthe duration of but one idea; or else where any motion or succession is\nso slow, as that it keeps not pace with the ideas in our minds, or the\nquickness in which they take their turns, as when any one or more ideas\nin their ordinary course come into our mind, between those which are\noffered to the sight by the different perceptible distances of a body\nin motion, or between sounds or smells following one another,\u2014there\nalso the sense of a constant continued succession is lost, and we\nperceive it not, but with certain gaps of rest between.\n13. The Mind cannot fix long on one invariable Idea.\nIf it be so, that the ideas of our minds, whilst we have any there, do\nconstantly change and shift in a continual succession, it would be\nimpossible, may any one say, for a man to think long of any one thing.\nBy which, if it be meant that a man may have one self-same single idea\na long time alone in his mind, without any variation at all, I think,\nin matter of fact, it is not possible. For which (not knowing how the\nideas of our minds are framed, of what materials they are made, whence\nthey have their light, and how they come to make their appearances) I\ncan give no other reason but experience: and I would have any one try,\nwhether he can keep one unvaried single idea in his mind, without any\nother, for any considerable time together.\n14. Proof.\nFor trial, let him take any figure, any degree of light or whiteness,\nor what other he pleases, and he will, I suppose, find it difficult to\nkeep all other ideas out of his mind; but that some, either of another\nkind, or various considerations of that idea, (each of which\nconsiderations is a new idea,) will constantly succeed one another in\nhis thoughts, let him be as wary as he can.\n15. The extent of our power over the succession of our ideas.\nAll that is in a man\u2019s power in this case, I think, is only to mind and\nobserve what the ideas are that take their turns in his understanding;\nor else to direct the sort, and call in such as he hath a desire or use\nof: but hinder the constant succession of fresh ones, I think he\ncannot, though he may commonly choose whether he will heedfully observe\nand consider them.\n16. Ideas, however made, include no sense of motion.\nWhether these several ideas in a man\u2019s mind be made by certain motions,\nI will not here dispute; but this I am sure, that they include no idea\nof motion in their appearance; and if a man had not the idea of motion\notherwise, I think he would have none at all, which is enough to my\npresent purpose; and sufficiently shows that the notice we take of the\nideas of our own minds, appearing there one after another, is that\nwhich gives us the idea of succession and duration, without which we\nshould have no such ideas at all. It is not then MOTION, but the\nconstant train of IDEAS in our minds whilst we are waking, that\nfurnishes us with the idea of duration; whereof motion no otherwise\ngives us any perception than as it causes in our minds a constant\nsuccession of ideas, as I have before showed: and we have as clear an\nidea of succession and duration, by the train of other ideas succeeding\none another in our minds, without the idea of any motion, as by the\ntrain of ideas caused by the uninterrupted sensible change of distance\nbetween two bodies, which we have from motion; and therefore we should\nas well have the idea of duration were there no sense of motion at all.\n17. Time is Duration set out by Measures.\nHaving thus got the idea of duration, the next thing natural for the\nmind to do, is to get some measure of this common duration, whereby it\nmight judge of its different lengths, and consider the distinct order\nwherein several things exist; without which a great part of our\nknowledge would be confused, and a great part of history be rendered\nvery useless. This consideration of duration, as set out by certain\nperiods and marked by certain measures or epochs, is that, I think,\nwhich most properly we call TIME.\n18. A good Measure of Time must divide its whole Duration into equal\nPeriods.\nIn the measuring of extension, there is nothing more required but the\napplication of the standard or measure we make use of to the thing of\nwhose extension we would be informed. But in the measuring of duration\nthis cannot be done, because no two different parts of succession can\nbe put together to measure one another. And nothing being a measure of\nduration but duration, as nothing is of extension but extension, we\ncannot keep by us any standing, unvarying measure of duration, which\nconsists in a constant fleeting succession, as we can of certain\nlengths of extension, as inches, feet, yards, &c., marked out in\npermanent parcels of matter. Nothing then could serve well for a\nconvenient measure of time, but what has divided the whole length of\nits duration into apparently equal portions, by constantly repeated\nperiods. What portions of duration are not distinguished, or considered\nas distinguished and measured, by such periods, come not so properly\nunder the notion of time; as appears by such phrases as these, viz.\n\u2018Before all time,\u2019 and \u2018When time shall be no more.\u2019\n19. The Revolutions of the Sun and Moon, the properest Measures of Time\nfor mankind.\nThe diurnal and annual revolutions of the sun, as having been, from the\nbeginning of nature, constant, regular, and universally observable by\nall mankind, and supposed equal to one another, have been with reason\nmade use of for the measure of duration. But the distinction of days\nand years having depended on the motion of the sun, it has brought this\nmistake with it, that it has been thought that motion and duration were\nthe measure one of another. For men, in the measuring of the length of\ntime, having been accustomed to the ideas of minutes, hours, days,\nmonths, years, &c., which they found themselves upon any mention of\ntime or duration presently to think on, all which portions of time were\nmeasured out by the motion of those heavenly bodies, they were apt to\nconfound time and motion; or at least to think that they had a\nnecessary connexion one with another. Whereas any constant periodical\nappearance, or alteration of ideas, in seemingly equidistant spaces of\nduration, if constant and universally observable, would have as well\ndistinguished the intervals of time, as those that have been made use\nof. For, supposing the sun, which some have taken to be a fire, had\nbeen lighted up at the same distance of time that it now every day\ncomes about to the same meridian, and then gone out again about twelve\nhours after, and that in the space of an annual revolution it had\nsensibly increased in brightness and heat, and so decreased\nagain,\u2014would not such regular appearances serve to measure out the\ndistances of duration to all that could observe it, as well without as\nwith motion? For if the appearances were constant, universally\nobservable, in equidistant periods, they would serve mankind for\nmeasure of time as well were the motion away.\n20. But not by their Motion, but periodical Appearances.\nFor the freezing of water, or the blooming of a plant, returning at\nequidistant periods in all parts of the earth, would as well serve men\nto reckon their years by, as the motions of the sun: and in effect we\nsee, that some people in America counted their years by the coming of\ncertain birds amongst them at their certain seasons, and leaving them\nat others. For a fit of an ague; the sense of hunger or thirst; a smell\nor a taste; or any other idea returning constantly at equidistant\nperiods, and making itself universally be taken notice of, would not\nfail to measure out the course of succession, and distinguish the\ndistances of time. Thus we see that men born blind count time well\nenough by years, whose revolutions yet they cannot distinguish by\nmotions that they perceive not. And I ask whether a blind man, who\ndistinguished his years either by the heat of summer, or cold of\nwinter; by the smell of any flower of the spring, or taste of any fruit\nof the autumn, would not have a better measure of time than the Romans\nhad before the reformation of their calendar by Julius Caesar, or many\nother people, whose years, notwithstanding the motion of the sun, which\nthey pretended to make use of, are very irregular? And it adds no small\ndifficulty to chronology, that the exact lengths of the years that\nseveral nations counted by, are hard to be known, they differing very\nmuch one from another, and I think I may say all of them from the\nprecise motion of the sun. And if the sun moved from the creation to\nthe flood constantly in the equator, and so equally dispersed its light\nand heat to all the habitable parts of the earth, in days all of the\nsame length without its annual variations to the tropics, as a late\ningenious author supposes, I do not think it very easy to imagine, that\n(notwithstanding the motion of the sun) men should in the antediluvian\nworld, from the beginning, count by years, or measure their time by\nperiods that had no sensible mark very obvious to distinguish them by.\n21. No two Parts of Duration can be certainly known to be equal.\nBut perhaps it will be said,\u2014without a regular motion, such as of the\nsun, or some other, how could it ever be known that such periods were\nequal? To which I answer,\u2014the equality of any other returning\nappearances might be known by the same way that that of days was known,\nor presumed to be so at first; which was only by judging of them by the\ntrain of ideas which had passed in men\u2019s minds in the intervals; by\nwhich train of ideas discovering inequality in the natural days, but\nnone in the artificial days, the artificial days, or nuchthaemera, were\nguessed to be equal, which was sufficient to make them serve for a\nmeasure; though exacter search has since discovered inequality in the\ndiurnal revolutions of the sun, and we know not whether the annual also\nbe not unequal. These yet, by their presumed and apparent equality,\nserve as well to reckon time by (though not to measure the parts of\nduration exactly) as if they could be proved to be exactly equal. We\nmust, therefore, carefully distinguish betwixt duration itself, and the\nmeasures we make use of to judge of its length. Duration, in itself, is\nto be considered as going on in one constant, equal, uniform course:\nbut none of the measures of it which we make use of can be KNOWN to do\nso, nor can we be assured that their assigned parts or periods are\nequal in duration one to another; for two successive lengths of\nduration, however measured, can never be demonstrated to be equal. The\nmotion of the sun, which the world used so long and so confidently for\nan exact measure of duration, has, as I said, been found in its several\nparts unequal. And though men have, of late, made use of a pendulum, as\na more steady and regular motion than that of the sun, or, (to speak\nmore truly,) of the earth;\u2014yet if any one should be asked how he\ncertainly knows that the two successive swings of a pendulum are equal,\nit would be very hard to satisfy him that they are infallibly so; since\nwe cannot be sure that the cause of that motion, which is unknown to\nus, shall always operate equally; and we are sure that the medium in\nwhich the pendulum moves is not constantly the same: either of which\nvarying, may alter the equality of such periods, and thereby destroy\nthe certainty and exactness of the measure by motion, as well as any\nother periods of other appearances; the notion of duration still\nremaining clear, though our measures of it cannot (any of them) be\ndemonstrated to be exact. Since then no two portions of succession can\nbe brought together, it is impossible ever certainly to know their\nequality. All that we can do for a measure of time is, to take such as\nhave continual successive appearances at seemingly equidistant periods;\nof which seeming equality we have no other measure, but such as the\ntrain of our own ideas have lodged in our memories, with the\nconcurrence of other PROBABLE reasons, to persuade us of their\nequality.\n22. Time not the Measure of Motion\nOne thing seems strange to me,\u2014that whilst all men manifestly measured\ntime by the motion of the great and visible bodies of the world, time\nyet should be defined to be the \u2018measure of motion\u2019: whereas it is\nobvious to every one who reflects ever so little on it, that to measure\nmotion, space is as necessary to be considered as time; and those who\nlook a little farther will find also the bulk of the thing moved\nnecessary to be taken into the computation, by any one who will\nestimate or measure motion so as to judge right of it. Nor indeed does\nmotion any otherwise conduce to the measuring of duration, than as it\nconstantly brings about the return of certain sensible ideas, in\nseeming equidistant periods. For if the motion of the sun were as\nunequal as of a ship driven by unsteady winds, sometimes very slow, and\nat others irregularly very swift; or if, being constantly equally\nswift, it yet was not circular, and produced not the same\nappearances,\u2014it would not at all help us to measure time, any more than\nthe seeming unequal motion of a comet does.\n23. Minutes, hours, days, and years are, then, no more Minutes, Hours,\nDays, and Years not necessary Measures of duration, necessary to time\nor duration, than inches, feet, yards, and miles, marked out in any\nmatter, are to extension. For, though we in this part of the universe,\nby the constant use of them, as of periods set out by the revolutions\nof the sun, or as known parts of such periods, have fixed the ideas of\nsuch lengths of duration in our minds, which we apply to all parts of\ntime whose lengths we would consider; yet there may be other parts of\nthe universe, where they no more use these measures of ours, than in\nJapan they do our inches, feet, or miles; but yet something analogous\nto them there must be. For without some regular periodical returns, we\ncould not measure ourselves, or signify to others, the length of any\nduration; though at the same time the world were as full of motion as\nit is now, but no part of it disposed into regular and apparently\nequidistant revolutions. But the different measures that may be made\nuse of for the account of time, do not at all alter the notion of\nduration, which is the thing to be measured; no more than the different\nstandards of a foot and a cubit alter the notion of extension to those\nwho make use of those different measures.\n24. Our Measure of Time applicable to Duration before Time.\nThe mind having once got such a measure of time as the annual\nrevolution of the sun, can apply that measure to duration wherein that\nmeasure itself did not exist, and with which, in the reality of its\nbeing, it had nothing to do. For should one say, that Abraham was born\nin the two thousand seven hundred and twelfth year of the Julian\nperiod, it is altogether as intelligible as reckoning from the\nbeginning of the world, though there were so far back no motion of the\nsun, nor any motion at all. For, though the Julian period be supposed\nto begin several hundred years before there were really either days,\nnights, or years, marked out by any revolutions of the sun,\u2014yet we\nreckon as right, and thereby measure durations as well, as if really at\nthat time the sun had existed, and kept the same ordinary motion it\ndoth now. The idea of duration equal to an annual revolution of the\nsun, is as easily APPLICABLE in our thoughts to duration, where no sun\nor motion was, as the idea of a foot or yard, taken from bodies here,\ncan be applied in our thoughts to distances beyond the confines of the\nworld, where are no bodies at all.\n25. As we can measure space in our thoughts where there is no body.\nFor supposing it were 5639 miles, or millions of miles, from this place\nto the remotest body of the universe, (for, being finite, it must be at\na certain distance,) as we suppose it to be 5639 years from this time\nto the first existence of any body in the beginning of the world;\u2014we\ncan, in our thoughts, apply this measure of a year to duration before\nthe creation, or beyond the duration of bodies or motion, as we can\nthis measure of a mile to space beyond the utmost bodies; and by the\none measure duration, where there was no motion, as well as by the\nother measure space in our thoughts, where there is no body.\n26. The assumption that the world is neither boundless nor eternal.\nIf it be objected to me here, that, in this way of explaining of time,\nI have begged what I should not, viz. that the world is neither eternal\nnor infinite; I answer, That to my present purpose it is not needful,\nin this place, to make use of arguments to evince the world to be\nfinite both in duration and extension. But it being at least as\nconceivable as the contrary, I have certainly the liberty to suppose\nit, as well as any one hath to suppose the contrary; and I doubt not,\nbut that every one that will go about it, may easily conceive in his\nmind the beginning of motion, though not of all duration, and so may\ncome to a step and non ultra in his consideration of motion. So also,\nin his thoughts, he may set limits to body, and the extension belonging\nto it; but not to space, where no body is, the utmost bounds of space\nand duration being beyond the reach of thought, as well as the utmost\nbounds of number are beyond the largest comprehension of the mind; and\nall for the same reason, as we shall see in another place.\n27. Eternity.\nBy the same means, therefore, and from the same original that we come\nto have the idea of time, we have also that idea which we call\nEternity; viz. having got the idea of succession and duration, by\nreflecting on the train of our own ideas, caused in us either by the\nnatural appearances of those ideas coming constantly of themselves into\nour waking thoughts, or else caused by external objects successively\naffecting our senses; and having from the revolutions of the sun got\nthe ideas of certain lengths of duration,\u2014we can in our thoughts add\nsuch lengths of duration to one another, as often as we please, and\napply them, so added, to durations past or to come. And this we can\ncontinue to do on, without bounds or limits, and proceed in infinitum,\nand apply thus the length of the annual motion of the sun to duration,\nsupposed before the sun\u2019s or any other motion had its being, which is\nno more difficult or absurd, than to apply the notion I have of the\nmoving of a shadow one hour to-day upon the sun-dial to the duration of\nsomething last night, v. g. the burning of a candle, which is now\nabsolutely separate from all actual motion; and it is as impossible for\nthe duration of that flame for an hour last night to co-exist with any\nmotion that now is, or for ever shall be, as for any part of duration,\nthat was before the beginning of the world, to co exist with the motion\nof the sun now. But yet this hinders not but that, having the IDEA of\nthe length of the motion of the shadow on a dial between the marks of\ntwo hours, I can as distinctly measure in my thoughts the duration of\nthat candle-light last night, as I can the duration of anything that\ndoes now exist: and it is no more than to think, that, had the sun\nshone then on the dial, and moved after the same rate it doth now, the\nshadow on the dial would have passed from one hour-line to another\nwhilst that flame of the candle lasted.\n28. Our measures of Duration dependent on our ideas.\nThe notion of an hour, day, or year, being only the idea I have of the\nlength of certain periodical regular motions, neither of which motions\ndo ever all at once exist, but only in the ideas I have of them in my\nmemory derived from my senses or reflection; I can with the same ease,\nand for the same reason, apply it in my thoughts to duration antecedent\nto all manner of motion, as well as to anything that is but a minute or\na day antecedent to the motion that at this very moment the sun is in.\nAll things past are equally and perfectly at rest; and to this way of\nconsideration of them are all one, whether they were before the\nbeginning of the world, or but yesterday: the measuring of any duration\nby some motion depending not at all on the REAL co-existence of that\nthing to that motion, or any other periods of revolution, but the\nhaving a clear IDEA of the length of some periodical known motion, or\nother interval of duration, in my mind, and applying that to the\nduration of the thing I would measure.\n29. The Duration of anything need not be co-existent with the motion we\nmeasure it by.\nHence we see that some men imagine the duration of of the world, from\nits first existence to this present year 1689, to have been 5639 years,\nor equal to 5639 annual revolutions of the sun, and others a great deal\nmore; as the Egyptians of old, who in the time of Alexander counted\n23,000 years from the reign of the sun; and the Chinese now, who\naccount the world 3,269,000 years old, or more; which longer duration\nof the world, according to their computation, though I should not\nbelieve to be true, yet I can equally imagine it with them, and as\ntruly understand, and say one is longer than the other, as I\nunderstand, that Methusalem\u2019s life was longer than Enoch\u2019s. And if the\ncommon reckoning of 5639 should be true, (as it may be as well as any\nother assigned,) it hinders not at all my imagining what others mean,\nwhen they make the world one thousand years older, since every one may\nwith the same facility imagine (I do not say believe) the world to be\n50,000 years old, as 5639; and may as well conceive the duration of\n50,000 years as 5639. Whereby it appears that, to the measuring the\nduration of anything by time, it is not requisite that that thing\nshould be co-existent to the motion we measure by, or any other\nperiodical revolution; but it suffices to this purpose, that we have\nthe idea of the length of ANY regular periodical appearances, which we\ncan in our minds apply to duration, with which the motion or appearance\nnever co-existed.\n30. Infinity in Duration.\nFor, as in the history of the creation delivered by Moses, I can\nimagine that light existed three days before the sun was, or had any\nmotion, barely by thinking that the duration of light before the sun\nwas created was so long as (IF the sun had moved then as it doth now)\nwould have been equal to three of his diurnal revolutions; so by the\nsame way I can have an idea of the chaos, or angels, being created\nbefore there was either light or any continued motion, a minute, an\nhour, a day, a year, or one thousand years. For, if I can but consider\nduration equal to one minute, before either the being or motion of any\nbody, I can add one minute more till I come to sixty; and by the same\nway of adding minutes, hours, or years (i.e. such or such parts of the\nsun\u2019s revolutions, or any other period whereof I have the idea) proceed\nIN INFINITUM, and suppose a duration exceeding as many such periods as\nI can reckon, let me add whilst I will, which I think is the notion we\nhave of eternity; of whose infinity we have no other notion than we\nhave of the infinity of number, to which we can add for ever without\nend.\n31. Origin of our Ideas of Duration, and of the measures of it.\nAnd thus I think it is plain, that from those two fountains of all\nknowledge before mentioned, viz. reflection and sensation, we got the\nideas of duration, and the measures of it.\nFor, First, by observing what passes in our minds, how our ideas there\nin train constantly some vanish and others begin to appear, we come by\nthe idea of SUCCESSION. Secondly, by observing a distance in the parts\nof this succession, we get the idea of DURATION.\nThirdly, by sensation observing certain appearances, at certain regular\nand seeming equidistant periods, we get the ideas of certain LENGTHS or\nMEASURES OF DURATION, as minutes, hours, days, years, &c.\nFourthly, by being able to repeat those measures of time, or ideas of\nstated length of duration, in our minds, as often as we will, we can\ncome to imagine DURATION,\u2014WHERE NOTHING DOES REALLY ENDURE OR EXIST;\nand thus we imagine to-morrow, next year, or seven years hence.\nFifthly, by being able to repeat ideas of any length of time, as of a\nminute, a year, or an age, as often as we will in our own thoughts, and\nadding them one to another, without ever coming to the end of such\naddition, any nearer than we can to the end of number, to which we can\nalways add; we come by the idea of ETERNITY, as the future eternal\nduration of our souls, as well as the eternity of that infinite Being\nwhich must necessarily have always existed.\nSixthly, by considering any part of infinite duration, as set out by\nperiodical measures, we come by the idea of what we call TIME in\ngeneral.\nCHAPTER XV.\nIDEAS OF DURATION AND EXPANSION, CONSIDERED TOGETHER.\n1. Both capable of greater and less.\nThough we have in the precedent chapters dwelt pretty long on the\nconsiderations of space and duration, yet, they being ideas of general\nconcernment, that have something very abstruse and peculiar in their\nnature, the comparing them one with another may perhaps be of use for\ntheir illustration; and we may have the more clear and distinct\nconception of them by taking a view of them together. Distance or\nspace, in its simple abstract conception, to avoid confusion, I call\nEXPANSION, to distinguish it from extension, which by some is used to\nexpress this distance only as it is in the solid parts of matter, and\nso includes, or at least intimates, the idea of body: whereas the idea\nof pure distance includes no such thing. I prefer also the word\nexpansion to space, because space is often applied to distance of\nfleeting successive parts, which never exist together, as well as to\nthose which are permanent. In both these (viz. expansion and duration)\nthe mind has this common idea of continued lengths, capable of greater\nor less quantities. For a man has as clear an idea of the difference of\nthe length of an hour and a day, as of an inch and a foot.\n2. Expansion not bounded by Matter.\nThe mind, having got the idea of the length of any part of expansion,\nlet it be a span, or a pace, or what length you will, CAN, as has been\nsaid, repeat that idea, and so, adding it to the former, enlarge its\nidea of length, and make it equal to two spans, or two paces; and so,\nas often as it will, till it equals the distance of any parts of the\nearth one from another, and increase thus till it amounts to the\ndistance of the sun or remotest star. By such a progression as this,\nsetting out from the place where it is, or any other place, it can\nproceed and pass beyond all those lengths, and find nothing to stop its\ngoing on, either in or without body. It is true, we can easily in our\nthoughts come to the end of SOLID extension; the extremity and bounds\nof all body we have no difficulty to arrive at: but when the mind is\nthere, it finds nothing to hinder its progress into this endless\nexpansion; of that it can neither find nor conceive any end. Nor let\nany one say, that beyond the bounds of body, there is nothing at all;\nunless he will confine God within the limits of matter. Solomon, whose\nunderstanding was filled and enlarged with wisdom, seems to have other\nthoughts when he says, \u2018Heaven, and the heaven of heavens, cannot\ncontain thee.\u2019 And he, I think, very much magnifies to himself the\ncapacity of his own understanding, who persuades himself that he can\nextend his thoughts further than God exists, or imagine any expansion\nwhere He is not.\n3. Nor Duration by Motion.\nJust so is it in duration. The mind having got the idea of any length\nof duration, can double, multiply, and enlarge it, not only beyond its\nown, but beyond the existence of all corporeal beings, and all the\nmeasures of time, taken from the great bodies of all the world and\ntheir motions. But yet every one easily admits, that, though we make\nduration boundless, as certainly it is, we cannot yet extend it beyond\nall being. God, every one easily allows, fills eternity; and it is hard\nto find a reason why any one should doubt that He likewise fills\nimmensity. His infinite being is certainly as boundless one way as\nanother; and methinks it ascribes a little too much to matter to say,\nwhere there is no body, there is nothing.\n4. Why Men more easily admit infinite Duration than infinite Expansion.\nHence I think we may learn the reason why every one familiarly and\nwithout the least hesitation speaks of and supposes Eternity, and\nsticks not to ascribe INFINITY to DURATION; but it is with more\ndoubting and reserve that many admit or suppose the INFINITY OF SPACE.\nThe reason whereof seems to me to be this,\u2014That duration and extension\nbeing used as names of affections belonging to other beings, we easily\nconceive in God infinite duration, and we cannot avoid doing so: but,\nnot attributing to him extension, but only to matter, which is finite,\nwe are apter to doubt of the existence of expansion without matter; of\nwhich alone we commonly suppose it an attribute. And, therefore, when\nmen pursue their thoughts of space, they are apt to stop at the\nconfines of body: as if space were there at an end too, and reached no\nfurther. Or if their ideas, upon consideration, carry them further, yet\nthey term what is beyond the limits of the universe, imaginary space:\nas if IT were nothing, because there is no body existing in it. Whereas\nduration, antecedent to all body, and to the motions which it is\nmeasured by, they never term imaginary: because it is never supposed\nvoid of some other real existence. And if the names of things may at\nall direct our thoughts towards the original of men\u2019s ideas, (as I am\napt to think they may very much,) one may have occasion to think by the\nname DURATION, that the continuation of existence, with a kind of\nresistance to any destructive force, and the continuation of solidity\n(which is apt to be confounded with, and if we will look into the\nminute anatomical parts of matter, is little different from, hardness)\nwere thought to have some analogy, and gave occasion to words so near\nof kin as durare and durum esse. And that durare is applied to the idea\nof hardness, as well as that of existence, we see in Horace, Epod. xvi.\nferro duravit secula. But, be that as it will, this is certain, that\nwhoever pursues his own thoughts, will find them sometimes launch out\nbeyond the extent of body, into the infinity of space or expansion; the\nidea whereof is distinct and separate from body and all other things:\nwhich may, (to those who please,) be a subject of further meditation.\n5. Time to Duration is as Place to Expansion.\nTime in general is to duration as place to expansion. They are so much\nof those boundless oceans of eternity and immensity as is set out and\ndistinguished from the rest, as it were by landmarks; and so are made\nuse of to denote the position of FINITE real beings, in respect one to\nanother, in those uniform infinite oceans of duration and space. These,\nrightly considered, are only ideas of determinate distances from\ncertain known points, fixed in distinguishable sensible things, and\nsupposed to keep the same distance one from another. From such points\nfixed in sensible beings we reckon, and from them we measure our\nportions of those infinite quantities; which, so considered, are that\nwhich we call TIME and PLACE. For duration and space being in\nthemselves uniform and boundless, the order and position of things,\nwithout such known settled points, would be lost in them; and all\nthings would lie jumbled in an incurable confusion.\n6. Time and Place are taken for so much of either as are set out by the\nExistence and Motion of Bodies.\nTime and place, taken thus for determinate distinguishable portions of\nthose infinite abysses of space and duration, set out or supposed to be\ndistinguished from the rest, by marks and known boundaries, have each\nof them a twofold acceptation.\nFIRST, Time in general is commonly taken for so much of infinite\nduration as is measured by, and co-existent with, the existence and\nmotions of the great bodies of the universe, as far as we know anything\nof them: and in this sense time begins and ends with the frame of this\nsensible world, as in these phrases before mentioned, \u2018Before all\ntime,\u2019 or, \u2018When time shall be no more.\u2019 Place likewise is taken\nsometimes for that portion of infinite space which is possessed by and\ncomprehended within the material world; and is thereby distinguished\nfrom the rest of expansion; though this may be more properly called\nextension than place. Within these two are confined, and by the\nobservable parts of them are measured and determined, the particular\ntime or duration, and the particular extension and place, of all\ncorporeal beings.\n7. Sometimes for so much of either as we design by Measures taken from\nthe Bulk or Motion of Bodies.\nSECONDLY, sometimes the word time is used in a larger sense, and is\napplied to parts of that infinite duration, not that were really\ndistinguished and measured out by this real existence, and periodical\nmotions of bodies, that were appointed from the beginning to be for\nsigns and for seasons and for days and years, and are accordingly our\nmeasures of time; but such other portions too of that infinite uniform\nduration, which we upon any occasion do suppose equal to certain\nlengths of measured time; and so consider them as bounded and\ndetermined. For, if we should suppose the creation, or fall of the\nangels, was at the beginning of the Julian period, we should speak\nproperly enough, and should be understood if we said, it is a longer\ntime since the creation of angels than the creation of the world, by\n7640 years: whereby we would mark out so much of that undistinguished\nduration as we suppose equal to, and would have admitted, 7640 annual\nrevolutions of the sun, moving at the rate it now does. And thus\nlikewise we sometimes speak of place, distance, or bulk, in the great\nINANE, beyond the confines of the world, when we consider so much of\nthat space as is equal to, or capable to receive, a body of any\nassigned dimensions, as a cubic foot; or do suppose a point in it, at\nsuch a certain distance from any part of the universe.\n8. They belong to all finite beings.\nWHERE and WHEN are questions belonging to all finite existences, and\nare by us always reckoned from some known parts of this sensible world,\nand from some certain epochs marked out to us by the motions observable\nin it. Without some such fixed parts or periods, the order of things\nwould be lost, to our finite understandings, in the boundless\ninvariable oceans of duration and expansion, which comprehend in them\nall finite beings, and in their full extent belong only to the Deity.\nAnd therefore we are not to wonder that we comprehend them not, and do\nso often find our thoughts at a loss, when we would consider them,\neither abstractly in themselves, or as any way attributed to the first\nincomprehensible Being. But when applied to any particular finite\nbeings, the extension of any body is so much of that infinite space as\nthe bulk of the body takes up. And place is the position of any body,\nwhen considered at a certain distance from some other. As the idea of\nthe particular duration of anything is, an idea of that portion of\ninfinite duration which passes during the existence of that thing; so\nthe time when the thing existed is, the idea of that space of duration\nwhich passed between some known and fixed period of duration, and the\nbeing of that thing. One shows the distance of the extremities of the\nbulk or existence of the same thing, as that it is a foot square, or\nlasted two years; the other shows the distance of it in place, or\nexistence from other fixed points of space or duration, as that it was\nin the middle of Lincoln\u2019s Inn Fields, or the first degree of Taurus,\nand in the year of our Lord 1671, or the 1000th year of the Julian\nperiod. All which distances we measure by preconceived ideas of certain\nlengths of space and duration,\u2014as inches, feet, miles, and degrees, and\nin the other, minutes, days, and years, &c.\n9. All the Parts of Extension are Extension, and all the Parts of\nDuration are Duration.\nThere is one thing more wherein space and duration have a great\nconformity, and that is, though they are justly reckoned amongst our\nSIMPLE IDEAS, yet none of the distinct ideas we have of either is\nwithout all manner of composition: it is the very nature of both of\nthem to consist of parts: but their parts being all of the same kind,\nand without the mixture of any other idea, hinder them not from having\na place amongst simple ideas. Could the mind, as in number, come to so\nsmall a part of extension or duration as excluded divisibility, THAT\nwould be, as it were, the indivisible unit or idea; by repetition of\nwhich, it would make its more enlarged ideas of extension and duration.\nBut, since the mind is not able to frame an idea of ANY space without\nparts, instead thereof it makes use of the common measures, which, by\nfamiliar use in each country, have imprinted themselves on the memory\n(as inches and feet; or cubits and parasangs; and so seconds, minutes,\nhours, days, and years in duration);\u2014the mind makes use, I say, of such\nideas as these, as simple ones: and these are the component parts of\nlarger ideas, which the mind upon occasion makes by the addition of\nsuch known lengths which it is acquainted with. On the other side, the\nordinary smallest measure we have of either is looked on as an unit in\nnumber, when the mind by division would reduce them into less\nfractions. Though on both sides, both in addition and division, either\nof space or duration, when the idea under consideration becomes very\nbig or very small, its precise bulk becomes very obscure and confused;\nand it is the NUMBER of its repeated additions or divisions that alone\nremains clear and distinct; as will easily appear to any one who will\nlet his thoughts loose in the vast expansion of space, or divisibility\nof matter. Every part of duration is duration too; and every part of\nextension is extension, both of them capable of addition or division in\ninfinitum. But THE LEAST PORTIONS OF EITHER OF THEM, WHEREOF WE HAVE\nCLEAR AND DISTINCT IDEAS, may perhaps be fittest to be considered by\nus, as the simple ideas of that kind out of which our complex modes of\nspace, extension, and duration are made up, and into which they can\nagain be distinctly resolved. Such a small part in duration may be\ncalled a MOMENT, and is the time of one idea in our minds, in the train\nof their ordinary succession there. The other, wanting a proper name, I\nknow not whether I may be allowed to call a SENSIBLE POINT, meaning\nthereby the least particle of matter or space we can discern, which is\nordinarily about a minute, and to the sharpest eyes seldom less than\nthirty seconds of a circle, whereof the eye is the centre.\n10. Their Parts inseparable.\nExpansion and duration have this further agreement, that, though they\nare both considered by us as having parts, yet their parts are not\nseparable one from another, no not even in thought: though the parts of\nbodies from whence we take our MEASURE of the one; and the parts of\nmotion, or rather the succession of ideas in our minds, from whence we\ntake the MEASURE of the other, may be interrupted and separated; as the\none is often by rest, and the other is by sleep, which we call rest\ntoo.\n11. Duration is as a Line, Expansion as a Solid.\nBut there is this manifest difference between them,\u2014That the ideas of\nlength which we have of expansion are turned every way, and so make\nfigure, and breadth, and thickness; but duration is but as it were the\nlength of one straight line, extended in infinitum, not capable of\nmultiplicity, variation, or figure; but is one common measure of all\nexistence whatsoever, wherein all things, whilst they exist, equally\npartake. For this present moment is common to all things that are now\nin being, and equally comprehends that part of their existence, as much\nas if they were all but one single being; and we may truly say, they\nall exist in the SAME moment of time. Whether angels and spirits have\nany analogy to this, in respect to expansion, is beyond my\ncomprehension: and perhaps for us, who have understandings and\ncomprehensions suited to our own preservation, and the ends of our own\nbeing, but not to the reality and extent of all other beings, it is\nnear as hard to conceive any existence, or to have an idea of any real\nbeing, with a perfect negation of all manner of expansion, as it is to\nhave the idea of any real existence with a perfect negation of all\nmanner of duration. And therefore, what spirits have to do with space,\nor how they communicate in it, we know not. All that we know is, that\nbodies do each singly possess its proper portion of it, according to\nthe extent of solid parts; and thereby exclude all other bodies from\nhaving any share in that particular portion of space, whilst it remains\nthere.\n12. Duration has never two Parts together, Expansion altogether.\nDURATION, and TIME which is a part of it, is the idea we have of\nPERISHING distance, of which no two parts exist together, but follow\neach other in succession; an EXPANSION is the idea of LASTING distance,\nall whose parts exist together and are not capable of succession. And\ntherefore, though we cannot conceive any duration without succession,\nnor can put it together in our thoughts that any being does NOW exist\nto-morrow, or possess at once more than the present moment of duration;\nyet we can conceive the eternal duration of the Almighty far different\nfrom that of man, or any other finite being. Because man comprehends\nnot in his knowledge or power all past and future things: his thoughts\nare but of yesterday, and he knows not what to-morrow will bring forth.\nWhat is once past he can never recall; and what is yet to come he\ncannot make present. What I say of man, I say of all finite beings;\nwho, though they may far exceed man in knowledge and power, yet are no\nmore than the meanest creature, in comparison with God himself. Finite\nor any magnitude holds not any proportion to infinite. God\u2019s infinite\nduration, being accompanied with infinite knowledge and infinite power,\nhe sees all things, past and to come; and they are no more distant from\nhis knowledge, no further removed from his sight, than the present:\nthey all lie under the same view: and there is nothing which he cannot\nmake exist each moment he pleases. For the existence of all things,\ndepending upon his good pleasure, all things exist every moment that he\nthinks fit to have them exist. To conclude: expansion and duration do\nmutually embrace and comprehend each other; every part of space being\nin every part of duration, and every part of duration in every part of\nexpansion. Such a combination of two distinct ideas is, I suppose,\nscarce to be found in all that great variety we do or can conceive, and\nmay afford matter to further speculation.\nCHAPTER XVI.\nIDEA OF NUMBER.\n1. Number the simplest and most universal Idea.\nAmongst all the ideas we have, as there is none suggested to the mind\nby more ways, so there is none more simple, than that of UNITY, or one:\nit has no shadow of variety or composition in it: every object our\nsenses are employed about; every idea in our understandings; every\nthought of our minds, brings this idea along with it. And therefore it\nis the most intimate to our thoughts, as well as it is, in its\nagreement to all other things, the most universal idea we have. For\nnumber applies itself to men, angels, actions, thoughts; everything\nthat either doth exist or can be imagined.\n2. Its Modes made by Addition.\nBy repeating this idea in our minds, and adding the repetitions\ntogether, we come by the COMPLEX ideas of the MODES of it. Thus, by\nadding one to one, we have the complex idea of a couple; by putting\ntwelve units together we have the complex idea of a dozen; and so of a\nscore or a million, or any other number.\n3. Each Mode distinct.\nThe SIMPLE MODES of NUMBER are of all other the most distinct; every\nthe least variation, which is an unit, making each combination as\nclearly different from that which approacheth nearest to it, as the\nmost remote; two being as distinct from one, as two hundred; and the\nidea of two as distinct from the idea of three, as the magnitude of the\nwhole earth is from that of a mite. This is not so in other simple\nmodes, in which it is not so easy, nor perhaps possible for us to\ndistinguish betwixt two approaching ideas, which yet are really\ndifferent. For who will undertake to find a difference between the\nwhite of this paper and that of the next degree to it: or can form\ndistinct ideas of every the least excess in extension?\n4. Therefore Demonstrations in Numbers the most precise.\nThe clearness and distinctness of each mode of number from all others,\neven those that approach nearest, makes me apt to think that\ndemonstrations in numbers, if they are not more evident and exact than\nin extension, yet they are more general in their use, and more\ndeterminate in their application. Because the ideas of numbers are more\nprecise and distinguishable than in extension; where every equality and\nexcess are not so easy to be observed or measured; because our thoughts\ncannot in space arrive at any determined smallness beyond which it\ncannot go, as an unit; and therefore the quantity or proportion of any\nthe least excess cannot be discovered; which is clear otherwise in\nnumber, where, as has been said, 91 is as distinguishable from 90 as\nfrom 9000, though 91 be the next immediate excess to 90. But it is not\nso in extension, where, whatsoever is more than just a foot or an inch,\nis not distinguishable from the standard of a foot or an inch; and in\nlines which appear of an equal length, one may be longer than the other\nby innumerable parts: nor can any one assign an angle, which shall be\nthe next biggest to a right one.\n5. Names necessary to Numbers.\nBy the repeating, as has been said, the idea of an unit, and joining it\nto another unit, we make thereof one collective idea, marked by the\nname two. And whosoever can do this, and proceed on, still adding one\nmore to the last collective idea which he had of any number, and gave a\nname to it, may count, or have ideas, for several collections of units,\ndistinguished one from another, as far as he hath a series of names for\nfollowing numbers, and a memory to retain that series, with their\nseveral names: all numeration being but still the adding of one unit\nmore, and giving to the whole together, as comprehended in one idea, a\nnew or distinct name or sign, whereby to know it from those before and\nafter, and distinguish it from every smaller or greater multitude of\nunits. So that he that can add one to one, and so to two, and so go on\nwith his tale, taking still with him the distinct names belonging to\nevery progression; and so again, by subtracting an unit from each\ncollection, retreat and lessen them, is capable of all the ideas of\nnumbers within the compass of his language, or for which he hath names,\nthough not perhaps of more. For, the several simple modes of numbers\nbeing in our minds but so many combinations of units, which have no\nvariety, nor are capable of any other difference but more or less,\nnames or marks for each distinct combination seem more necessary than\nin any other sort of ideas. For, without such names or marks, we can\nhardly well make use of numbers in reckoning, especially where the\ncombination is made up of any great multitude of units; which put\ntogether, without a name or mark to distinguish that precise\ncollection, will hardly be kept from being a heap in confusion.\n6. Another reason for the necessity of names to numbers.\nThis I think to be the reason why some Americans I have spoken with,\n(who were otherwise of quick and rational parts enough,) could not, as\nwe do, by any means count to 1000; nor had any distinct idea of that\nnumber, though they could reckon very well to 20. Because their\nlanguage being scanty, and accommodated only to the few necessaries of\na needy, simple life, unacquainted either with trade or mathematics,\nhad no words in it to stand for 1000; so that when they were discoursed\nwith of those greater numbers, they would show the hairs of their head,\nto express a great multitude, which they could not number; which\ninability, I suppose, proceeded from their want of names. The\nTououpinambos had no names for numbers above 5; any number beyond that\nthey made out by showing their fingers, and the fingers of others who\nwere present. And I doubt not but we ourselves might distinctly number\nin words a great deal further than we usually do, would we find out but\nsome fit denominations to signify them by; whereas, in the way we take\nnow to name them, by millions of millions of millions, &c., it is hard\nto go beyond eighteen, or at most, four and twenty, decimal\nprogressions, without confusion. But to show how much distinct names\nconduce to our well reckoning, or having useful ideas of numbers, let\nus see all these following figures in one continued line, as the marks\nof one number: v. g.\nNonillions. 857324\nOctillions. 162486\nSeptillions. 345896\nSextillions. 437918\nQuintrillions. 423147\nQuartrillions. 248106\nTrillions. 235421\nBillions. 261734\nMillions. 368149\nUnits. 623137\nThe ordinary way of naming this number in English, will be the often\nrepeating of millions, of millions, of millions, of millions, of\nmillions, of millions, of millions, of millions, (which is the\ndenomination of the second six figures). In which way, it will be very\nhard to have any distinguishing notions of this number. But whether, by\ngiving every six figures a new and orderly denomination, these, and\nperhaps a great many more figures in progression, might not easily be\ncounted distinctly, and ideas of them both got more easily to\nourselves, and more plainly signified to others, I leave it to be\nconsidered. This I mention only to show how necessary distinct names\nare to numbering, without pretending to introduce new ones of my\ninvention.\n7. Why Children number not earlier.\nThus children, either for want of names to mark the several\nprogressions of numbers, or not having yet the faculty to collect\nscattered ideas into complex ones, and range them in a regular order,\nand so retain them in their memories, as is necessary to reckoning, do\nnot begin to number very early, nor proceed in it very far or steadily,\ntill a good while after they are well furnished with good store of\nother ideas: and one may often observe them discourse and reason pretty\nwell, and have very clear conceptions of several other things, before\nthey can tell twenty. And some, through the default of their memories,\nwho cannot retain the several combinations of numbers, with their\nnames, annexed in their distinct orders, and the dependence of so long\na train of numeral progressions, and their relation one to another, are\nnot able all their lifetime to reckon, or regularly go over any\nmoderate series of numbers. For he that will count twenty, or have any\nidea of that number, must know that nineteen went before, with the\ndistinct name or sign of every one of them, as they stand marked in\ntheir order; for wherever this fails, a gap is made, the chain breaks,\nand the progress in numbering can go no further. So that to reckon\nright, it is required, (1) That the mind distinguish carefully two\nideas, which are different one from another only by the addition or\nsubtraction of ONE unit: (2) That it retain in memory the names or\nmarks of the several combinations, from an unit to that number; and\nthat not confusedly, and at random, but in that exact order that the\nnumbers follow one another. In either of which, if it trips, the whole\nbusiness of numbering will be disturbed, and there will remain only the\nconfused idea of multitude, but the ideas necessary to distinct\nnumeration will not be attained to.\n8. Number measures all Measurables.\nThis further is observable in number, that it is that which the mind\nmakes use of in measuring all things that by us are measurable, which\nprincipally are EXPANSION and DURATION; and our idea of infinity, even\nwhen applied to those, seems to be nothing but the infinity of number.\nFor what else are our ideas of Eternity and Immensity, but the repeated\nadditions of certain ideas of imagined parts of duration and expansion,\nwith the infinity of number; in which we can come to no end of\naddition? For such an inexhaustible stock, number (of all other our\nideas) most clearly furnishes us with, as is obvious to every one. For\nlet a man collect into one sum as great a number as he pleases, this\nmultitude how great soever, lessens not one jot the power of adding to\nit, or brings him any nearer the end of the inexhaustible stock of\nnumber; where still there remains as much to be added, as if none were\ntaken out. And this ENDLESS ADDITION or ADDIBILITY (if any one like the\nword better) of numbers, so apparent to the mind, is that, I think,\nwhich gives us the clearest and most distinct idea of infinity: of\nwhich more in the following chapter.\nCHAPTER XVII.\nOF INFINITY.\n1. Infinity, in its original Intention, attributed to Space, Duration,\nand Number.\nHe that would know what kind of idea it is to which we give the name of\nINFINITY, cannot do it better than by considering to what infinity is\nby the mind more immediately attributed; and then how the mind comes to\nframe it.\nFINITE and INFINITE seem to me to be looked upon by the mind as the\nMODES OF QUANTITY, and to be attributed primarily in their first\ndesignation only to those things which have parts, and are capable of\nincrease or diminution by the addition or subtraction of any the least\npart: and such are the ideas of space, duration, and number, which we\nhave considered in the foregoing chapters. It is true, that we cannot\nbut be assured, that the great God, of whom and from whom are all\nthings, is incomprehensibly infinite: but yet, when we apply to that\nfirst and supreme Being our idea of infinite, in our weak and narrow\nthoughts, we do it primarily in respect to his duration and ubiquity;\nand, I think, more figuratively to his power, wisdom, and goodness, and\nother attributes which are properly inexhaustible and incomprehensible,\n&c. For, when we call THEM infinite, we have no other idea of this\ninfinity but what carries with it some reflection on, and imitation of,\nthat number or extent of the acts or objects of God\u2019s power, wisdom,\nand goodness, which can never be supposed so great, or so many, which\nthese attributes will not always surmount and exceed, let us multiply\nthem in our thoughts as far as we can, with all the infinity of endless\nnumber. I do not pretend to say how these attributes are in God, who is\ninfinitely beyond the reach of our narrow capacities: they do, without\ndoubt, contain in them all possible perfection: but this, I say, is our\nway of conceiving them, and these our ideas of their infinity.\n2. The Idea of Finite easily got.\nFinite then, and infinite, being by the mind looked on as MODIFICATIONS\nof expansion and duration, the next thing to be considered, is,\u2014HOW THE\nMIND COMES BY THEM. As for the idea of finite, there is no great\ndifficulty. The obvious portions of extension that affect our senses,\ncarry with them into the mind the idea of finite: and the ordinary\nperiods of succession, whereby we measure time and duration, as hours,\ndays, and years, are bounded lengths. The difficulty is, how we come by\nthose BOUNDLESS IDEAS of eternity and immensity; since the objects we\nconverse with come so much short of any approach or proportion to that\nlargeness.\n3. How we come by the Idea of Infinity.\nEvery one that has any idea of any stated lengths of space, as a foot,\nfinds that he can repeat that idea; and joining it to the former, make\nthe idea of two feet; and by the addition of a third, three feet; and\nso on, without ever coming to an end of his additions, whether of the\nsame idea of a foot, or, if he pleases, of doubling it, or any other\nidea he has of any length, as a mile, or diameter of the earth, or of\nthe orbis magnus: for whichever of these he takes, and how often soever\nhe doubles, or any otherwise multiplies it, he finds, that, after he\nhas continued his doubling in his thoughts, and enlarged his idea as\nmuch as he pleases, he has no more reason to stop, nor is one jot\nnearer the end of such addition, than he was at first setting out: the\npower of enlarging his idea of space by further additions remaining\nstill the same, he hence takes the idea of infinite space.\n4. Our Idea of Space boundless.\nThis, I think, is the way whereby the mind gets the IDEA of infinite\nspace. It is a quite different consideration, to examine whether the\nmind has the idea of such a boundless space ACTUALLY EXISTING; since\nour ideas are not always proofs of the existence of things: but yet,\nsince this comes here in our way, I suppose I may say, that we are APT\nTO THINK that space in itself is actually boundless, to which\nimagination the idea of space or expansion of itself naturally leads\nus. For, it being considered by us, either as the extension of body, or\nas existing by itself, without any solid matter taking it up, (for of\nsuch a void space we have not only the idea, but I have proved, as I\nthink, from the motion of body, its necessary existence,) it is\nimpossible the mind should be ever able to find or suppose any end of\nit, or be stopped anywhere in its progress in this space, how far\nsoever it extends its thoughts. Any bounds made with body, even\nadamantine walls, are so far from putting a stop to the mind in its\nfurther progress in space and extension that it rather facilitates and\nenlarges it. For so far as that body reaches, so far no one can doubt\nof extension; and when we are come to the utmost extremity of body,\nwhat is there that can there put a stop, and satisfy the mind that it\nis at the end of space, when it perceives that it is not; nay, when it\nis satisfied that body itself can move into it? For, if it be necessary\nfor the motion of body, that there should be an empty space, though\never so little, here amongst bodies; and if it be possible for body to\nmove in or through that empty space;\u2014nay, it is impossible for any\nparticle of matter to move but into an empty space; the same\npossibility of a body\u2019s moving into a void space, beyond the utmost\nbounds of body, as well as into a void space interspersed amongst\nbodies, will always remain clear and evident: the idea of empty pure\nspace, whether within or beyond the confines of all bodies, being\nexactly the same, differing not in nature, though in bulk; and there\nbeing nothing to hinder body from moving into it. So that wherever the\nmind places itself by any thought, either amongst, or remote from all\nbodies, it can, in this uniform idea of space, nowhere find any bounds,\nany end; and so must necessarily conclude it, by the very nature and\nidea of each part of it, to be actually infinite.\n5. And so of Duration.\nAs, by the power we find in ourselves of repeating, as often as we\nwill, any idea of space, we get the idea of IMMENSITY; so, by being\nable to repeat the idea of any length of duration we have in our minds,\nwith all the endless addition of number, we come by the idea of\nETERNITY. For we find in ourselves, we can no more come to an end of\nsuch repeated ideas than we can come to the end of number; which every\none perceives he cannot. But here again it is another question, quite\ndifferent from our having an IDEA of eternity, to know whether there\nwere ANY REAL BEING, whose duration has been eternal. And as to this, I\nsay, he that considers something now existing, must necessarily come to\nSomething eternal. But having spoke of this in another place, I shall\nsay here no more of it, but proceed on to some other considerations of\nour idea of infinity.\n6. Why other Ideas are not capable of Infinity.\nIf it be so, that our idea of infinity be got from the power we observe\nin ourselves of repeating, without end, our own ideas, it may be\ndemanded,\u2014Why we do not attribute infinity to other ideas, as well as\nthose of space and duration; since they may be as easily, and as often,\nrepeated in our minds as the other: and yet nobody ever thinks of\ninfinite sweetness or infinite whiteness, though he can repeat the idea\nof sweet or white, as frequently as those of a yard or a day? To which\nI answer,\u2014All the ideas that are considered as having parts, and are\ncapable of increase by the addition of an equal or less parts, afford\nus, by their repetition, the idea of infinity; because, with this\nendless repetition, there is continued an enlargement of which there\nCAN be no end. But for other ideas it is not so. For to the largest\nidea of extension or duration that I at present have, the addition of\nany the least part makes an increase; but to the perfectest idea I have\nof the whitest whiteness, if I add another of a less equal whiteness,\n(and of a whiter than I have, I cannot add the idea,) it makes no\nincrease, and enlarges not my idea at all; and therefore the different\nideas of whiteness, &c. are called degrees. For those ideas that\nconsist of part are capable of being augmented by every addition of the\nleast part; but if you take the idea of white, which one parcel of snow\nyielded yesterday to our sight, and another idea of white from another\nparcel of snow you see to-day, and put them together in your mind, they\nembody, as it were, all run into one, and the idea of whiteness is not\nat all increased and if we add a less degree of whiteness to a greater,\nwe are so far from increasing, that we diminish it. Those ideas that\nconsist not of parts cannot be augmented to what proportion men please,\nor be stretched beyond what they have received by their senses; but\nspace, duration, and number, being capable of increase by repetition,\nleave in the mind an idea of endless room for more; nor can we conceive\nanywhere a stop to a further addition or progression: and so those\nideas ALONE lead our minds towards the thought of infinity.\n7. Difference between infinity of Space, and Space infinite.\nThough our idea of infinity arise from the contemplation of quantity,\nand the endless increase the mind is able to make in quantity, by the\nrepeated additions of what portions thereof it pleases; yet I guess we\ncause great confusion in our thoughts, when we join infinity to any\nsupposed idea of quantity the mind can be thought to have, and so\ndiscourse or reason about an infinite quantity, as an infinite space,\nor an infinite duration. For, as our idea of infinity being, as I\nthink, AN ENDLESS GROWING IDEA, but the idea of any quantity the mind\nhas, being at that time TERMINATED in that idea, (for be it as great as\nit will, it can be no greater than it is,)\u2014to join infinity to it, is\nto adjust a standing measure to a growing bulk; and therefore I think\nit is not an insignificant subtilty, if I say, that we are carefully to\ndistinguish between the idea of the infinity of space, and the idea of\na space infinite. The first is nothing but a supposed endless\nprogression of the mind, over what repeated ideas of space it pleases;\nbut to have actually in the mind the idea of a space infinite, is to\nsuppose the mind already passed over, and actually to have a view of\nALL those repeated ideas of space which an ENDLESS repetition can never\ntotally represent to it; which carries in it a plain contradiction.\n8. We have no Idea of infinite Space.\nThis, perhaps, will be a little plainer, if we consider it in numbers.\nThe infinity of numbers, to the end of whose addition every one\nperceives there is no approach, easily appears to any one that reflects\non it. But, how clear soever this idea of the infinity of number be,\nthere is nothing yet more evident than the absurdity of the actual idea\nof an infinite number. Whatsoever POSITIVE ideas we have in our minds\nof any space, duration, or number, let them be ever so great, they are\nstill finite; but when we suppose an inexhaustible remainder, from\nwhich we remove all bounds, and wherein we allow the mind an endless\nprogression of thought, without ever completing the idea, there we have\nour idea of infinity: which, though it seems to be pretty clear when we\nconsider nothing else in it but the negation of an end, yet, when we\nwould frame in our minds the idea of an infinite space or duration,\nthat idea is very obscure and confused, because it is made up of two\nparts, very different, if not inconsistent. For, let a man frame in his\nmind an idea of any space or number, as great as he will; it is plain\nthe mind RESTS AND TERMINATES in that idea, which is contrary to the\nidea of infinity, which CONSISTS IN A SUPPOSED ENDLESS PROGRESSION. And\ntherefore I think it is that we are so easily confounded, when we come\nto argue and reason about infinite space or duration, &c. Because the\nparts of such an idea not being perceived to be, as they are,\ninconsistent, the one side or other always perplexes, whatever\nconsequences we draw from the other; as an idea of motion not passing\non would perplex any one who should argue from such an idea, which is\nnot better than an idea of motion at rest. And such another seems to me\nto be the idea of a space, or (which is the same thing) a number\ninfinite, i. e. of a space or number which the mind actually has, and\nso views and terminates in; and of a space or number, which, in a\nconstant and endless enlarging and progression, it can in thought never\nattain to. For, how large soever an idea of space I have in my mind, it\nis no larger than it is that instant that I have it, though I be\ncapable the next instant to double it, and so on in infinitum; for that\nalone is infinite which has no bounds; and that the idea of infinity,\nin which our thoughts can find none.\n9. Number affords us the clearest Idea of Infinity.\nBut of all other ideas, it is number, as I have said, which I think\nfurnishes us with the clearest and most distinct idea of infinity we\nare capable of. For, even in space and duration, when the mind pursues\nthe idea of infinity, it there makes use of the ideas and repetitions\nof numbers, as of millions and millions of miles, or years, which are\nso many distinct ideas,\u2014kept best by number from running into a\nconfused heap, wherein the mind loses itself; and when it has added\ntogether as many millions, &c., as it pleases, of known lengths of\nspace or duration, the clearest idea it can get of infinity, is the\nconfused incomprehensible remainder of endless addible numbers, which\naffords no prospect of stop or boundary.\n10. Our different Conceptions of the Infinity of Number contrasted with\nthose of Duration and Expansion.\nIt will, perhaps, give us a little further light into the idea we have\nof infinity, and discover to us, that it is NOTHING BUT THE INFINITY OF\nNUMBER APPLIED TO DETERMINATE PARTS, OF WHICH WE HAVE IN OUR MINDS THE\nDISTINCT IDEAS, if we consider that number is not generally thought by\nus infinite, whereas duration and extension are apt to be so; which\narises from hence,\u2014that in number we are at one end, as it were: for\nthere being in number nothing LESS than an unit, we there stop, and are\nat an end; but in addition, or increase of number, we can set no\nbounds: and so it is like a line, whereof one end terminating with us,\nthe other is extended still forwards, beyond all that we can conceive.\nBut in space and duration it is otherwise. For in duration we consider\nit as if this line of number were extended BOTH ways\u2014to an\nunconceivable, undeterminate, and infinite length; which is evident to\nanyone that will but reflect on what consideration he hath of Eternity;\nwhich, I suppose, will find to be nothing else but the turning this\ninfinity of number both ways, a parte ante and a parte post, as they\nspeak. For, when we would consider eternity, a parte ante, what do we\nbut, beginning from ourselves and the present time we are in, repeat in\nour minds ideas of years, or ages, or any other assignable portion of\nduration past, with a prospect of proceeding in such addition with all\nthe infinity of number: and when we would consider eternity, a parte\npost, we just after the same rate begin from ourselves, and reckon by\nmultiplied periods yet to come, still extending that line of number as\nbefore. And these two being put together, are that infinite duration we\ncall ETERNITY which, as we turn our view either way, forwards or\nbackward appears infinite, because we still turn that way the infinite\nend of number, i.e. the power still of adding more.\n11. How we conceive the Infinity of Space.\nThe same happens also in space, wherein, conceiving ourselves to be, as\nit were, in the centre, we do on all sides pursue those indeterminable\nlines of number; and reckoning any way from ourselves, a yard, mile,\ndiameter of the earth or orbis magnus,\u2014by the infinity of number, we\nadd others to them, as often as we will. And having no more reason to\nset bounds to those repeated ideas than we have to set bounds to\nnumber, we have that indeterminable idea of immensity.\n12. Infinite Divisibility.\nAnd since in any bulk of matter our thoughts can never arrive at the\nutmost divisibility, therefore there is an apparent infinity to us also\nin that, which has the infinity also of number; but with this\ndifference,\u2014that, in the former considerations of the infinity of space\nand duration, we only use addition of numbers; whereas this is like the\ndivision of an unit into its fractions, wherein the mind also can\nproceed in infinitum, as well as in the former additions; it being\nindeed but the addition still of new numbers: though in the addition of\nthe one, we can have no more the POSITIVE idea of a space infinitely\ngreat, than, in the division of the other, we can have the positive\nidea of a body infinitely little;\u2014our idea of infinity being, as I may\nsay, a growing or fugitive idea, still in a boundless progression, that\ncan stop nowhere.\n13. No positive Idea of Infinity.\nThough it be hard, I think, to find anyone so absurd as to say he has\nthe POSITIVE idea of an actual infinite number;\u2014the infinity whereof\nlies only in a power still of adding any combination of units to any\nformer number, and that as long and as much as one will; the like also\nbeing in the infinity of space and duration, which power leaves always\nto the mind room for endless additions;\u2014yet there be those who imagine\nthey have positive ideas of infinite duration and space. It would, I\nthink, be enough to destroy any such positive idea of infinite, to ask\nhim that has it,\u2014whether he could add to it or no; which would easily\nshow the mistake of such a positive idea. We can, I think, have no\npositive idea of any space or duration which is not made up of, and\ncommensurate to, repeated numbers of feet or yards, or days and years;\nwhich are the common measures, whereof we have the ideas in our minds,\nand whereby we judge of the greatness of this sort of quantities. And\ntherefore, since an infinite idea of space or duration must needs be\nmade up of infinite parts, it can have no other infinity than that of\nnumber CAPABLE still of further addition; but not an actual positive\nidea of a number infinite. For, I think it is evident, that the\naddition of finite things together (as are all lengths whereof we have\nthe positive ideas) can never otherwise produce the idea of infinite\nthan as number does; which consisting of additions of finite units one\nto another, suggests the idea of infinite, only by a power we find we\nhave of still increasing the sum, and adding more of the same kind;\nwithout coming one jot nearer the end of such progression.\n14. How we cannot have a positive idea of infinity in Quantity.\nThey who would prove their idea of infinite to be positive, seem to me\nto do it by a pleasant argument, taken from the negation of an end;\nwhich being negative, the negation on it is positive. He that considers\nthat the end is, in body, but the extremity or superficies of that\nbody, will not perhaps be forward to grant that the end is a bare\nnegative: and he that perceives the end of his pen is black or white,\nwill be apt to think that the end is something more than a pure\nnegation. Nor is it, when applied to duration, the bare negation of\nexistence, but more properly the last moment of it. But as they will\nhave the end to be nothing but the bare negation of existence, I am\nsure they cannot deny but the beginning of the first instant of being,\nand is not by any body conceived to be a bare negation; and therefore,\nby their own argument, the idea of eternal, A PARTE ANTE, or of a\nduration without a beginning, is but a negative idea.\n15. What is positive, what negative, in our Idea of infinite.\nThe idea of infinite has, I confess, something of positive in all those\nthings we apply to it. When we would think of infinite space or\nduration, we at first step usually make some very large idea, as\nperhaps of millions of ages, or miles, which possibly we double and\nmultiply several times. All that we thus amass together in our thoughts\nis positive, and the assemblage of a great number of positive ideas of\nspace or duration. But what still remains beyond this we have no more a\npositive distinct notion of than a mariner has of the depth of the sea;\nwhere, having let down a large portion of his sounding-line, he reaches\nno bottom. Whereby he knows the depth to be so many fathoms, and more;\nbut how much the more is, he hath no distinct notion at all: and could\nhe always supply new line, and find the plummet always sink, without\never stopping, he would be something in the posture of the mind\nreaching after a complete and positive idea of infinity. In which case,\nlet this line be ten, or ten thousand fathoms long, it equally\ndiscovers what is beyond it, and gives only this confused and\ncomparative idea, that this is not all, but one may yet go farther. So\nmuch as the mind comprehends of any space, it has a positive idea of:\nbut in endeavouring to make it infinite,\u2014it being always enlarging,\nalways advancing,\u2014the idea is still imperfect and incomplete. So much\nspace as the mind takes a view of in its contemplation of greatness, is\na clear picture, and positive in the understanding: but infinite is\nstill greater. 1. Then the idea of SO MUCH is positive and clear. 2.\nThe idea of GREATER is also clear; but it is but a comparative idea,\nthe idea of SO MUCH GREATER AS CANNOT BE COMPREHENDED. 3. And this is\nplainly negative: not positive. For he has no positive clear idea of\nthe largeness of any extension, (which is that sought for in the idea\nof infinite), that has not a comprehensive idea of the dimensions of\nit: and such, nobody, I think, pretends to in what is infinite. For to\nsay a man has a positive clear idea of any quantity, without knowing\nhow great it is, is as reasonable as to say, he has the positive clear\nidea of the number of the sands on the sea-shore, who knows not how\nmany there be, but only that they are more than twenty. For just such a\nperfect and positive idea has he of an infinite space or duration, who\nsays it is LARGER THAN the extent or duration of ten, one hundred, one\nthousand, or any other number of miles, or years, whereof he has or can\nhave a positive idea; which is all the idea, I think, we have of\ninfinite. So that what lies beyond our positive idea TOWARDS infinity,\nlies in obscurity, and has the indeterminate confusion of a negative\nidea, wherein I know I neither do nor can comprehend all I would, it\nbeing too large for a finite and narrow capacity. And that cannot but\nbe very far from a positive complete idea, wherein the greatest part of\nwhat I would comprehend is left out, under the undeterminate intimation\nof being still greater. For to say, that, having in any quantity\nmeasured so much, or gone so far, you are not yet at the end, is only\nto say that that quantity is greater. So that the negation of an end in\nany quantity is, in other words, only to say that it is bigger; and a\ntotal negation of an end is but carrying this bigger still with you, in\nall the progressions your thoughts shall make in quantity; and adding\nthis IDEA OF STILL GREATER to ALL the ideas you have, or can be\nsupposed to have, of quantity. Now, whether such an idea as that be\npositive, I leave any one to consider.\n16. We have no positive Idea of an infinite Duration.\nI ask those who say they have a positive idea of eternity, whether\ntheir idea of duration includes in it succession, or not? If it does\nnot, they ought to show the difference of their notion of duration,\nwhen applied to an eternal Being, and to a finite; since, perhaps,\nthere may be others as well as I, who will own to them their weakness\nof understanding in this point, and acknowledge that the notion they\nhave of duration forces them to conceive, that whatever has duration,\nis of a longer continuance to-day than it was yesterday. If, to avoid\nsuccession in external existence, they return to the punctum stans of\nthe schools, I suppose they will thereby very little mend the matter,\nor help us to a more clear and positive idea of infinite duration;\nthere being nothing more inconceivable to me than duration without\nsuccession. Besides, that punctum stans, if it signify anything, being\nnot quantum, finite or infinite cannot belong to it. But, if our weak\napprehensions cannot separate succession from any duration whatsoever,\nour idea of eternity can be nothing but of INFINITE SUCCESSION OF\nMOMENTS OF DURATION WHEREIN ANYTHING DOES EXIST; and whether any one\nhas, or can have, a positive idea of an actual infinite number, I leave\nhim to consider, till his infinite number be so great that he himself\ncan add no more to it; and as long as he can increase it, I doubt he\nhimself will think the idea he hath of it a little too scanty for\npositive infinity.\n17. No complete Idea of Eternal Being.\nI think it unavoidable for every considering, rational creature, that\nwill but examine his own or any other existence, to have the notion of\nan eternal, wise Being, who had no beginning: and such an idea of\ninfinite duration I am sure I have. But this negation of a beginning,\nbeing but the negation of a positive thing, scarce gives me a positive\nidea of infinity; which, whenever I endeavour to extend my thoughts to,\nI confess myself at a loss, and I find I cannot attain any clear\ncomprehension of it.\n18. No positive Idea of infinite Space.\nHe that thinks he has a positive idea of infinite space, will, when he\nconsiders it, find that he can no more have a positive idea of the\ngreatest, than he has of the least space. For in this latter, which\nseems the easier of the two, and more within our comprehension, we are\ncapable only of a comparative idea of smallness, which will always be\nless than any one whereof we have the positive idea. All our POSITIVE\nideas of any quantity, whether great or little, have always bounds,\nthough our COMPARATIVE idea, whereby we can always add to the one, and\ntake from the other, hath no bounds. For that which remains, either\ngreat or little, not being comprehended in that positive idea which we\nhave, lies in obscurity; and we have no other idea of it, but of the\npower of enlarging the one and diminishing the other, WITHOUT CEASING.\nA pestle and mortar will as soon bring any particle of matter to\nindivisibility, as the acutest thought of a mathematician; and a\nsurveyor may as soon with his chain measure out infinite space, as a\nphilosopher by the quickest flight of mind reach it or by thinking\ncomprehend it; which is to have a positive idea of it. He that thinks\non a cube of an inch diameter, has a clear and positive idea of it in\nhis mind, and so can frame one of 1/2, 1/4, 1/8, and so on, till he has\nthe idea in his thoughts of something very little; but yet reaches not\nthe idea of that incomprehensible littleness which division can\nproduce. What remains of smallness is as far from his thoughts as when\nhe first began; and therefore he never comes at all to have a clear and\npositive idea of that smallness which is consequent to infinite\ndivisibility.\n19. What is positive, what negative, in our Idea of Infinite.\nEvery one that looks towards infinity does, as I have said, at first\nglance make some very large idea of that which he applies it to, let it\nbe space or duration; and possibly he wearies his thoughts, by\nmultiplying in his mind that first large idea: but yet by that he comes\nno nearer to the having a positive clear idea of what remains to make\nup a positive infinite, than the country fellow had of the water which\nwas yet to come, and pass the channel of the river where he stood:\n\u2018Rusticus expectat dum defluat amnis, at ille\nLabitur, et labetur in omne volubilis \u00e6vum.\u2019\n20. Some think they have a positive Idea of Eternity, and not of\ninfinite Space.\nThere are some I have met that put so much difference between infinite\nduration and infinite space, that they persuade themselves that they\nhave a positive idea of eternity, but that they have not, nor can have\nany idea of infinite space. The reason of which mistake I suppose to be\nthis\u2014that finding, by a due contemplation of causes and effects, that\nit is necessary to admit some Eternal Being, and so to consider the\nreal existence of that Being as taken up and commensurate to their idea\nof eternity; but, on the other side, not finding it necessary, but, on\nthe contrary, apparently absurd, that body should be infinite, they\nforwardly conclude that they can have no idea of infinite space,\nbecause they can have no idea of infinite matter. Which consequence, I\nconceive, is very ill collected, because the existence of matter is no\nways necessary to the existence of space, no more than the existence of\nmotion, or the sun, is necessary to duration, though duration uses to\nbe measured by it. And I doubt not but that a man may have the idea of\nten thousand miles square, without any body so big, as well as the idea\nof ten thousand years, without any body so old. It seems as easy to me\nto have the idea of space empty of body, as to think of the capacity of\na bushel without corn, or the hollow of a nut-shell without a kernel in\nit: it being no more necessary that there should be existing a solid\nbody, infinitely extended, because we have an idea of the infinity of\nspace, than it is necessary that the world should be eternal, because\nwe have an idea of infinite duration. And why should we think our idea\nof infinite space requires the real existence of matter to support it,\nwhen we find that we have as clear an idea of an infinite duration to\ncome, as we have of infinite duration past? Though I suppose nobody\nthinks it conceivable that anything does or has existed in that future\nduration. Nor is it possible to join our idea of future duration with\npresent or past existence, any more than it is possible to make the\nideas of yesterday, to-day, and to-morrow to be the same; or bring ages\npast and future together, and make them contemporary. But if these men\nare of the mind, that they have clearer ideas of infinite duration than\nof infinite space, because it is past doubt that God has existed from\nall eternity, but there is no real matter co-extended with infinite\nspace; yet those philosophers who are of opinion that infinite space is\npossessed by God\u2019s infinite omnipresence, as well as infinite duration\nby his eternal existence, must be allowed to have as clear an idea of\ninfinite space as of infinite duration; though neither of them, I\nthink, has any positive idea of infinity in either case. For whatsoever\npositive ideas a man has in his mind of any quantity, he can repeat it,\nand add it to the former, as easy as he can add together the ideas of\ntwo days, or two paces, which are positive ideas of lengths he has in\nhis mind, and so on as long as he pleases: whereby, if a man had a\npositive idea of infinite, either duration or space, he could add two\ninfinites together; nay, make one infinite infinitely bigger than\nanother\u2014absurdities too gross to be confuted.\n21. Supposed positive Ideas of Infinity, cause of Mistakes.\nBut yet if after all this, there be men who persuade themselves that\nthey have clear positive comprehensive ideas of infinity, it is fit\nthey enjoy their privilege: and I should be very glad (with some others\nthat I know, who acknowledge they have none such) to be better informed\nby their communication. For I have been hitherto apt to think that the\ngreat and inextricable difficulties which perpetually involve all\ndiscourses concerning infinity,\u2014whether of space, duration, or\ndivisibility, have been the certain marks of a defect in our ideas of\ninfinity, and the disproportion the nature thereof has to the\ncomprehension of our narrow capacities. For, whilst men talk and\ndispute of infinite space or duration, as if they had as complete and\npositive ideas of them as they have of the names they use for them, or\nas they have of a yard, or an hour, or any other determinate quantity;\nit is no wonder if the incomprehensible nature of the thing they\ndiscourse of, or reason about, leads them into perplexities and\ncontradictions, and their minds be overlaid by an object too large and\nmighty to be surveyed and managed by them.\n22. All these are modes of Ideas got from Sensation and Reflection.\nIf I have dwelt pretty long on the consideration of duration, space,\nand number, and what arises from the contemplation of them,\u2014Infinity,\nit is possibly no more than the matter requires; there being few simple\nideas whose MODES give more exercise to the thoughts of men than those\ndo. I pretend not to treat of them in their full latitude. It suffices\nto my design to show how the mind receives them, such as they are, from\nsensation and reflection; and how even the idea we have of infinity,\nhow remote soever it may seem to be from any object of sense, or\noperation of our mind, has, nevertheless, as all our other ideas, its\noriginal there. Some mathematicians perhaps, of advanced speculations,\nmay have other ways to introduce into their minds ideas of infinity.\nBut this hinders not but that they themselves, as well as all other\nmen, got the first ideas which they had of infinity from sensation and\nreflection, in the method we have here set down.\nCHAPTER XVIII.\nOTHER SIMPLE MODES.\n1. Other simple Modes of simple Ideas of sensation.\nThough I have, in the foregoing chapters, shown how from simple ideas\ntaken in by sensation, the mind comes to extend itself even to\ninfinity; which, however it may of all others seem most remote from any\nsensible perception, yet at last hath nothing in it but what is made\nout of simple ideas: received into the mind by the senses, and\nafterwards there put together, by the faculty the mind has to repeat\nits own ideas; \u2014Though, I say, these might be instances enough of\nsimple modes of the simple ideas of sensation, and suffice to show how\nthe mind comes by them, yet I shall, for method\u2019s sake, though briefly,\ngive an account of some few more, and then proceed to more complex\nideas.\n2. Simple modes of motion.\nTo slide, roll, tumble, walk, creep, run, dance, leap, skip, and\nabundance of others that might be named, are words which are no sooner\nheard but every one who understands English has presently in his mind\ndistinct ideas, which are all but the different modifications of\nmotion. Modes of motion answer those of extension; swift and slow are\ntwo different ideas of motion, the measures whereof are made of the\ndistances of time and space put together; so they are complex ideas,\ncomprehending time and space with motion.\n3. Modes of Sounds.\nThe like variety have we in sounds. Every articulate word is a\ndifferent modification of sound; by which we see that, from the sense\nof hearing, by such modifications, the mind may be furnished with\ndistinct ideas, to almost an infinite number. Sounds also, besides the\ndistinct cries of birds and beasts, are modified by diversity of notes\nof different length put together, which make that complex idea called a\ntune, which a musician may have in his mind when he hears or makes no\nsound at all, by reflecting on the ideas of those sounds, so put\ntogether silently in his own fancy.\n4. Modes of Colours.\nThose of colours are also very various: some we take notice of as the\ndifferent degrees, or as they were termed shades, of the same colour.\nBut since we very seldom make assemblages of colours, either for use or\ndelight, but figure is taken in also, and has its part in it, as in\npainting, weaving, needleworks, &c.;\u2014those which are taken notice of do\nmost commonly belong to MIXED MODES, as being made up of ideas of\ndivers kinds, viz. figure and colour, such as beauty, rainbow, &c.\n5. Modes of Tastes.\nAll compounded tastes and smells are also modes, made up of the simple\nideas of those senses. But they, being such as generally we have no\nnames for, are less taken notice of, and cannot be set down in writing;\nand therefore must be left without enumeration to the thoughts and\nexperience of my reader.\n6. Some simple Modes have no Names.\nIn general it may be observed, that those simple modes which are\nconsidered but as different DEGREES of the same simple idea, though\nthey are in themselves many of them very distinct ideas, yet have\nordinarily no distinct names, nor are much taken notice of, as distinct\nideas, where the difference is but very small between them. Whether men\nhave neglected these modes, and given no names to them, as wanting\nmeasures nicely to distinguish them; or because, when they were so\ndistinguished, that knowledge would not be of general or necessary use,\nI leave it to the thoughts of others. It is sufficient to my purpose to\nshow, that all our simple ideas come to our minds only by sensation and\nreflection; and that when the mood has them, it can variously repeat\nand compound them, and so make new complex ideas. But, though white,\nred, or sweet, &c. have not been modified, or made into complex ideas,\nby several combinations, so as to be named, and thereby ranked into\nspecies; yet some others of the simple ideas, viz. those of unity,\nduration, and motion, &c., above instanced in, as also power and\nthinking, have been thus modified to a great variety of complex ideas,\nwith names belonging to them.\n7. Why some Modes have, and others have not, Names.\nThe reason whereof, I suppose, has been this,\u2014That the great\nconcernment of men being with men one amongst another, the knowledge of\nmen, and their actions, and the signifying of them to one another, was\nmost necessary; and therefore they made ideas of ACTIONS very nicely\nmodified, and gave those complex ideas names, that they might the more\neasily record and discourse of those things they were daily conversant\nin, without long ambages and circumlocutions; and that the things they\nwere continually to give and receive information about might be the\neasier and quicker understood. That this is so, and that men in framing\ndifferent complex ideas, and giving them names, have been much governed\nby the end of speech in general, (which is a very short and expedite\nway of conveying their thoughts one to another), is evident in the\nnames which in several arts have been found out, and applied to several\ncomplex ideas of modified actions, belonging to their several trades,\nfor dispatch sake, in their direction or discourses about them. Which\nideas are not generally framed in the minds of men not conversant about\nthese operations. And thence the words that stand for them, by the\ngreatest part of men of the same language, are not understood: v. g.\nCOLTSHIRE, DRILLING, FILTRATION, COHOBATION, are words standing for\ncertain complex ideas, which being seldom in the minds of any but those\nfew whose particular employments do at every turn suggest them to their\nthoughts, those names of them are not generally understood but by\nsmiths and chymists; who, having framed the complex ideas which these\nwords stand for, and having given names to them, or received them from\nothers, upon hearing of these names in communication, readily conceive\nthose ideas in their minds;-as by COHOBATION all the simple ideas of\ndistilling, and the pouring the liquor distilled from anything back\nupon the remaining matter, and distilling it again. Thus we see that\nthere are great varieties of simple ideas, as of tastes and smells,\nwhich have no names; and of modes many more; which either not having\nbeen generally enough observed, or else not being of any great use to\nbe taken notice of in the affairs and converse of men, they have not\nhad names given to them, and so pass not for species. This we shall\nhave occasion hereafter to consider more at large, when we come to\nspeak of WORDS.\nCHAPTER XIX.\nOF THE MODES OF THINKING.\n1. Sensation, Remembrance, Contemplation, &c., modes of thinking.\nWhen the mind turns its view inwards upon itself, and contemplates its\nown actions, THINKING is the first that occurs. In it the mind observes\na great variety of modifications, and from thence receives distinct\nideas. Thus the perception or thought which actually accompanies, and\nis annexed to, any impression on the body, made by an external object,\nbeing distinct from all other modifications of thinking, furnishes the\nmind with a distinct idea, which we call SENSATION;\u2014which is, as it\nwere, the actual entrance of any idea into the understanding by the\nsenses. The same idea, when it again recurs without the operation of\nthe like object on the external sensory, is REMEMBRANCE: if it be\nsought after by the mind, and with pain and endeavour found, and\nbrought again in view, it is RECOLLECTION: if it be held there long\nunder attentive consideration, it is CONTEMPLATION: when ideas float in\nour mind without any reflection or regard of the understanding, it is\nthat which the French call REVERIE; our language has scarce a name for\nit: when the ideas that offer themselves (for, as I have observed in\nanother place, whilst we are awake, there will always be a train of\nideas succeeding one another in our minds) are taken notice of, and, as\nit were, registered in the memory, it is ATTENTION: when the mind with\ngreat earnestness, and of choice, fixes its view on any idea, considers\nit on all sides, and will not be called off by the ordinary\nsolicitation of other ideas, it is that we call INTENTION or STUDY:\nsleep, without dreaming, is rest from all these: and DREAMING itself is\nthe having of ideas (whilst the outward senses are stopped, so that\nthey receive not outward objects with their usual quickness) in the\nmind, not suggested by any external objects, or known occasion; nor\nunder any choice or conduct of the understanding at all: and whether\nthat which we call ECSTASY be not dreaming with the eyes open, I leave\nto be examined.\n2. Other modes of thinking.\nThese are some few instances of those various modes of thinking, which\nthe mind may observe in itself, and so have as distinct ideas of as it\nhath of white and red, a square or a circle. I do not pretend to\nenumerate them all, nor to treat at large of this set of ideas, which\nare got from reflection: that would be to make a volume. It suffices to\nmy present purpose to have shown here, by some few examples, of what\nsort these ideas are, and how the mind comes by them; especially since\nI shall have occasion hereafter to treat more at large of REASONING,\nJUDGING, VOLITION, and KNOWLEDGE, which are some of the most\nconsiderable operations of the mind, and modes of thinking.\n3. The various degrees of Attention in thinking.\nBut perhaps it may not be an unpardonable digression, nor wholly\nimpertinent to our present design, if we reflect here upon the\ndifferent state of the mind in thinking, which those instances of\nattention, reverie, and dreaming, &c., before mentioned, naturally\nenough suggest. That there are ideas, some or other, always present in\nthe mind of a waking man, every one\u2019s experience convinces him; though\nthe mind employs itself about them with several degrees of attention.\nSometimes the mind fixes itself with so much earnestness on the\ncontemplation of some objects, that it turns their ideas on all sides;\nmarks their relations and circumstances; and views every part so nicely\nand with such intention, that it shuts out all other thoughts, and\ntakes no notice of the ordinary impressions made then on the senses,\nwhich at another season would produce very sensible perceptions: at\nother times it barely observes the train of ideas that succeed in the\nunderstanding, without directing and pursuing any of them: and at other\ntimes it lets them pass almost quite unregarded, as faint shadows that\nmake no impression.\n4. Hence it is probable that Thinking is the Action, not the Essence of\nthe Soul.\nThis difference of intention, and remission of the mind in thinking,\nwith a great variety of degrees between earnest study and very near\nminding nothing at all, every one, I think, has experimented in\nhimself. Trace it a little further, and you find the mind in sleep\nretired as it were from the senses, and out of the reach of those\nmotions made on the organs of sense, which at other times produce very\nvivid and sensible ideas. I need not, for this, instance in those who\nsleep out whole stormy nights, without hearing the thunder, or seeing\nthe lightning, or feeling the shaking of the house, which are sensible\nenough to those who are waking. But in this retirement of the mind from\nthe senses, it often retains a yet more loose and incoherent manner of\nthinking, which we call dreaming. And, last of all, sound sleep closes\nthe scene quite, and puts an end to all appearances. This, I think\nalmost every one has experience of in himself, and his own observation\nwithout difficulty leads him thus far. That which I would further\nconclude from hence is, that since the mind can sensibly put on, at\nseveral times, several degrees of thinking, and be sometimes, even in a\nwaking man, so remiss, as to have thoughts dim and obscure to that\ndegree that they are very little removed from none at all; and at last,\nin the dark retirements of sound sleep, loses the sight perfectly of\nall ideas whatsoever: since, I say, this is evidently so in matter of\nfact and constant experience, I ask whether it be not probable, that\nthinking is the action and not the essence of the soul? Since the\noperations of agents will easily admit of intention and remission: but\nthe essences of things are not conceived capable of any such variation.\nBut this by the by.\nCHAPTER XX.\nOF MODES OF PLEASURE AND PAIN.\n1. Pleasure and Pain, simple Ideas.\nAMONGST the simple ideas which we receive both from sensation and\nreflection, PAIN and PLEASURE are two very considerable ones. For as in\nthe body there is sensation barely in itself, or accompanied with pain\nor pleasure, so the thought or perception of the mind is simply so, or\nelse accompanied also with pleasure or pain, delight or trouble, call\nit how you please. These, like other simple ideas, cannot be described,\nnor their names defined; the way of knowing them is, as of the simple\nideas of the senses, only by experience. For, to define them by the\npresence of good or evil, is no otherwise to make them known to us than\nby making us reflect on what we feel in ourselves, upon the several and\nvarious operations of good and evil upon our minds, as they are\ndifferently applied to or considered by us.\n2. Good and evil, what.\nThings then are good or evil, only in reference to pleasure or pain.\nThat we call GOOD, which is apt to cause or increase pleasure, or\ndiminish pain in us; or else to procure or preserve us the possession\nof any other good or absence of any evil. And, on the contrary, we name\nthat EVIL which is apt to produce or increase any pain, or diminish any\npleasure in us: or else to procure us any evil, or deprive us of any\ngood. By pleasure and pain, I must be understood to mean of body or\nmind, as they are commonly distinguished; though in truth they be only\ndifferent constitutions of the MIND, sometimes occasioned by disorder\nin the body, sometimes by thoughts of the mind.\n3. Our passions moved by Good and Evil.\nPleasure and pain and that which causes them,\u2014good and evil, are the\nhinges on which our passions turn. And if we reflect on ourselves, and\nobserve how these, under various considerations, operate in us; what\nmodifications or tempers of mind, what internal sensations (if I may so\ncall them) they produce in us we may thence form to ourselves the ideas\nof our passions.\n4. Love.\nThus any one reflecting upon the thought he has of the delight which\nany present or absent thing is apt to produce in him, has the idea we\ncall LOVE. For when a man declares in autumn when he is eating them, or\nin spring when there are none, that he loves grapes, it is no more but\nthat the taste of grapes delights him: let an alteration of health or\nconstitution destroy the delight of their taste, and he then can be\nsaid to love grapes no longer.\n5. Hatred.\nOn the contrary, the thought of the pain which anything present or\nabsent is apt to produce in us, is what we call HATRED. Were it my\nbusiness here to inquire any further than into the bare ideas of our\npassions, as they depend on different modifications of pleasure and\npain, I should remark that our love and hatred of inanimate insensible\nbeings is commonly founded on that pleasure and pain which we receive\nfrom their use and application any way to our senses though with their\ndestruction. But hatred or love, to beings capable of happiness or\nmisery, is often the uneasiness of delight which we find in ourselves,\narising from their very being or happiness. Thus the being and welfare\nof a man\u2019s children or friends, producing constant delight in him, he\nis said constantly to love them. But it suffices to note, that our\nideas of love and hatred are but the dispositions of the mind, in\nrespect of pleasure and pain in general, however caused in us.\n6. Desire.\nThe uneasiness a man finds in himself upon the absence of anything\nwhose present enjoyment carries the idea of delight with it, is that we\ncall DESIRE; which is greater or less as that uneasiness is more or\nless vehement. Where, by the by, it may perhaps be of some use to\nremark, that the chief, if not only spur to human industry and action\nis UNEASINESS. For whatsoever good is proposed, if its absence carries\nno displeasure or pain with it, if a man be easy and content without\nit, there is no desire of it, nor endeavour after it; there is no more\nbut a bare velleity, the term used to signify the lowest degree of\ndesire, and that which is next to none at all, when there is so little\nuneasiness in the absence of anything, that it carries a man no further\nthan some faint wishes for it, without any more effectual or vigorous\nuse of the means to attain it. Desire also is stopped or abated by the\nopinion of the impossibility or unattainableness of the good proposed,\nas far as the uneasiness is cured or allayed by that consideration.\nThis might carry our thoughts further, were it seasonable in this\nplace.\n7. Joy.\nJOY is a delight of the mind, from the consideration of the present or\nassured approaching possession of a good; and we are then possessed of\nany good, when we have it so in our power that we can use it when we\nplease. Thus a man almost starved has joy at the arrival of relief,\neven before he has the pleasure of using it: and a father, in whom the\nvery well-being of his children causes delight, is always, as long as\nhis children are in such a state, in the possession of that good; for\nhe needs but to reflect on it, to have that pleasure.\n8. Sorrow.\nSORROW is uneasiness in the mind, upon the thought of a good lost,\nwhich might have been enjoyed longer; or the sense of a present evil.\n9. Hope.\nHOPE is that pleasure in the mind, which every one finds in himself,\nupon the thought of a probable future enjoyment of a thing which is apt\nto delight him.\n10. Fear.\nFEAR is an uneasiness of the mind, upon the thought of future evil\nlikely to befall us.\n11. Despair.\nDESPAIR is the thought of the unattainableness of any good, which works\ndifferently in men\u2019s minds, sometimes producing uneasiness or pain,\nsometimes rest and indolency.\n12. Anger.\nANGER is uneasiness or discomposure of the mind, upon the receipt of\nany injury, with a present purpose of revenge.\n13. Envy.\nENVY is an uneasiness of the mind, caused by the consideration of a\ngood we desire obtained by one we think should not have had it before\nus.\n14. What Passions all Men have.\nThese two last, ENVY and ANGER, not being caused by pain and pleasure\nsimply in themselves, but having in them some mixed considerations of\nourselves and others, are not therefore to be found in all men, because\nthose other parts, of valuing their merits, or intending revenge, is\nwanting in them. But all the rest, terminating purely in pain and\npleasure, are, I think, to be found in all men. For we love, desire,\nrejoice, and hope, only in respect of pleasure; we hate, fear, and\ngrieve, only in respect of pain ultimately. In fine, all these passions\nare moved by things, only as they appear to be the causes of pleasure\nand pain, or to have pleasure or pain some way or other annexed to\nthem. Thus we extend our hatred usually to the subject (at least, if a\nsensible or voluntary agent) which has produced pain in us; because the\nfear it leaves is a constant pain: but we do not so constantly love\nwhat has done us good; because pleasure operates not so strongly on us\nas pain, and because we are not so ready to have hope it will do so\nagain. But this by the by.\n15. Pleasure and Pain, what.\nBy pleasure and pain, delight and uneasiness, I must all along be\nunderstood (as I have above intimated) to mean not only bodily pain and\npleasure, but whatsoever delight or uneasiness is felt by us, whether\narising from any grateful or unacceptable sensation or reflection.\n16. Removal or lessening of either.\nIt is further to be considered, that, in reference to the passions, the\nremoval or lessening of a pain is considered, and operates, as a\npleasure: and the loss or diminishing of a pleasure, as a pain.\n17. Shame.\nThe passions too have most of them, in most persons, operations on the\nbody, and cause various changes in it; which not being always sensible,\ndo not make a necessary part of the idea of each passion. For SHAME,\nwhich is an uneasiness of the mind upon the thought of having done\nsomething which is indecent, or will lessen the valued esteem which\nothers have for us, has not always blushing accompanying it.\n18. These Instances to show how our Ideas of the Passions are got from\nSensation and Reflection.\nI would not be mistaken here, as if I meant this as a Discourse of the\nPassions; they are many more than those I have here named: and those I\nhave taken notice of would each of them require a much larger and more\naccurate discourse. I have only mentioned these here, as so many\ninstances of modes of pleasure and pain resulting in our minds from\nvarious considerations of good and evil. I might perhaps have instanced\nin other modes of pleasure and pain, more simple than these; as the\npain of hunger and thirst, and the pleasure of eating and drinking to\nremove them: the pain of teeth set on edge; the pleasure of music; pain\nfrom captious uninstructive wrangling, and the pleasure of rational\nconversation with a friend, or of well-directed study in the search and\ndiscovery of truth. But the passions being of much more concernment to\nus, I rather made choice to instance in them, and show how the ideas we\nhave of them are derived from sensation or reflection.\nCHAPTER XXI.\nOF POWER.\n1. This Idea how got.\nThe mind being every day informed, by the senses, of the alteration of\nthose simple ideas it observes in things without; and taking notice how\none comes to an end, and ceases to be, and another begins to exist\nwhich was not before; reflecting also on what passes within itself, and\nobserving a constant change of its ideas, sometimes by the impression\nof outward objects on the senses, and sometimes by the determination of\nits own choice; and concluding from what it has so constantly observed\nto have been, that the like changes will for the future be made in the\nsame things, by like agents, and by the like ways,\u2014considers in one\nthing the possibility of having any of its simple ideas changed, and in\nanother the possibility of making that change; and so comes by that\nidea which we call POWER. Thus we say, Fire has a power to melt gold,\ni. e. to destroy the consistency of its insensible parts, and\nconsequently its hardness, and make it fluid; and gold has a power to\nbe melted; that the sun has a power to blanch wax, and wax a power to\nbe blanched by the sun, whereby the yellowness is destroyed, and\nwhiteness made to exist in its room. In which, and the like cases, the\npower we consider is in reference to the change of perceivable ideas.\nFor we cannot observe any alteration to be made in, or operation upon\nanything, but by the observable change of its sensible ideas; nor\nconceive any alteration to be made, but by conceiving a change of some\nof its ideas.\n2. Power, active and passive.\nPower thus considered is two-fold, viz. as able to make, or able to\nreceive any change. The one may be called ACTIVE, and the other PASSIVE\npower. Whether matter be not wholly destitute of active power, as its\nauthor, God, is truly above all passive power; and whether the\nintermediate state of created spirits be not that alone which is\ncapable of both active and passive power, may be worth consideration. I\nshall not now enter into that inquiry, my present business being not to\nsearch into the original of power, but how we come by the IDEA of it.\nBut since active powers make so great a part of our complex ideas of\nnatural substances, (as we shall see hereafter,) and I mention them as\nsuch, according to common apprehension; yet they being not, perhaps, so\ntruly ACTIVE powers as our hasty thoughts are apt to represent them, I\njudge it not amiss, by this intimation, to direct our minds to the\nconsideration of God and spirits, for the clearest idea of ACTIVE\npower.\n3. Power includes Relation.\nI confess power includes in it some kind of RELATION (a relation to\naction or change,) as indeed which of our ideas of what kind soever,\nwhen attentively considered, does not. For, our ideas of extension,\nduration, and number, do they not all contain in them a secret relation\nof the parts? Figure and motion have something relative in them much\nmore visibly. And sensible qualities, as colours and smells, &c. what\nare they but the powers of different bodies, in relation to our\nperception, &c.? And, if considered in the things themselves, do they\nnot depend on the bulk, figure, texture, and motion of the parts? All\nwhich include some kind of relation in them. Our idea therefore of\npower, I think, may well have a place amongst other SIMPLE IDEAS, and\nbe considered as one of them; being one of those that make a principal\ningredient in our complex ideas of substances, as we shall hereafter\nhave occasion to observe.\n4. The clearest Idea of active Power had from Spirit.\nOf passive power all sensible things abundantly furnish us with\nsensible ideas, whose sensible qualities and beings we find to be in\ncontinual flux. And therefore with reason we look on them as liable\nstill to the same change. Nor have we of ACTIVE power (which is the\nmore proper signification of the word power) fewer instances. Since\nwhatever change is observed, the mind must collect a power somewhere\nable to make that change, as well as a possibility in the thing itself\nto receive it. But yet, if we will consider it attentively, bodies, by\nour senses, do not afford us so clear and distinct an idea of active\npower, as we have from reflection on the operations of our minds. For\nall power relating to action, and there being but two sorts of action\nwhereof we have an idea, viz. thinking and motion, let us consider\nwhence we have the clearest ideas of the powers which produce these\nactions. (1) Of thinking, body affords us no idea at all; it is only\nfrom reflection that we have that. (2) Neither have we from body any\nidea of the beginning of motion. A body at rest affords us no idea of\nany active power to move; and when it is set in motion itself, that\nmotion is rather a passion than an action in it. For, when the ball\nobeys the motion of a billiard-stick, it is not any action of the ball,\nbut bare passion. Also when by impulse it sets another ball in motion\nthat lay in its way, it only communicates the motion it had received\nfrom another, and loses in itself so much as the other received: which\ngives us but a very obscure idea of an ACTIVE power of moving in body,\nwhilst we observe it only to TRANSFER, but not PRODUCE any motion. For\nit is but a very obscure idea of power which reaches not the production\nof the action, but the continuation of the passion. For so is motion in\na body impelled by another; the continuation of the alteration made in\nit from rest to motion being little more an action, than the\ncontinuation of the alteration of its figure by the same blow is an\naction. The idea of the BEGINNING of motion we have only from\nreflection on what passes in ourselves; where we find by experience,\nthat, barely by willing it, barely by a thought of the mind, we can\nmove the parts of our bodies, which were before at rest. So that it\nseems to me, we have, from the observation of the operation of bodies\nby our senses, but a very imperfect obscure idea of ACTIVE power; since\nthey afford us not any idea in themselves of the power to begin any\naction, either motion or thought. But if, from the impulse bodies are\nobserved to make one upon another, any one thinks he has a clear idea\nof power, it serves as well to my purpose; sensation being one of those\nways whereby the mind comes by its ideas: only I thought it worth while\nto consider here, by the way, whether the mind doth not receive its\nidea of active power clearer from reflection on its own operations,\nthan it doth from any external sensation.\n5. Will and Understanding two Powers in Mind or Spirit.\nThis, at least, I think evident,\u2014That we find in ourselves a power to\nbegin or forbear, continue or end several actions of our minds, and\nmotions of our bodies, barely by a thought or preference of the mind\nordering, or as it were commanding, the doing or not doing such or such\na particular action. This power which the mind has thus to order the\nconsideration of any idea, or the forbearing to consider it; or to\nprefer the motion of any part of the body to its rest, and vice versa,\nin any particular instance, is that which we call the WILL. The actual\nexercise of that power, by directing any particular action, or its\nforbearance, is that which we call VOLITION or WILLING. The forbearance\nof that action, consequent to such order or command of the mind, is\ncalled VOLUNTARY. And whatsoever action is performed without such a\nthought of the mind, is called INVOLUNTARY. The power of perception is\nthat which we call the UNDERSTANDING. Perception, which we make the act\nof the understanding, is of three sorts:\u20141. The perception of ideas in\nour minds. 2. The perception of the signification of signs. 3. The\nperception of the connexion or repugnancy, agreement or disagreement,\nthat there is between any of our ideas. All these are attributed to the\nunderstanding, or perceptive power, though it be the two latter only\nthat use allows us to say we understand.\n6. Faculties not real beings.\nThese powers of the mind, viz. of perceiving, and of preferring, are\nusually called by another name. And the ordinary way of speaking is,\nthat the understanding and will are two FACULTIES of the mind; a word\nproper enough, if it be used, as all words should be, so as not to\nbreed any confusion in men\u2019s thoughts, by being supposed (as I suspect\nit has been) to stand for some real beings in the soul that performed\nthose actions of understanding and volition. For when we say the WILL\nis the commanding and superior faculty of the soul; that it is or is\nnot free; that it determines the inferior faculties; that it follows\nthe dictates of the understanding, &c.,\u2014though these and the like\nexpressions, by those that carefully attend to their own ideas, and\nconduct their thoughts more by the evidence of things than the sound of\nwords, may be understood in a clear and distinct sense\u2014yet I suspect, I\nsay, that this way of speaking of FACULTIES has misled many into a\nconfused notion of so many distinct agents in us, which had their\nseveral provinces and authorities, and did command, obey, and perform\nseveral actions, as so many distinct beings; which has been no small\noccasion of wrangling, obscurity, and uncertainty, in questions\nrelating to them.\n7. Whence the Ideas of Liberty and Necessity.\nEvery one, I think, finds in HIMSELF a power to begin or forbear,\ncontinue or put an end to several actions in himself. From the\nconsideration of the extent of this power of the mind over the actions\nof the man, which everyone finds in himself, arise the IDEAS of LIBERTY\nand NECESSITY.\n8. Liberty, what.\nAll the actions that we have any idea of reducing themselves, as has\nbeen said, to these two, viz. thinking and motion; so far as a man has\npower to think or not to think, to move or not to move, according to\nthe preference or direction of his own mind, so far is a man FREE.\nWherever any performance or forbearance are not equally in a man\u2019s\npower; wherever doing or not doing will not equally FOLLOW upon the\npreference of his mind directing it, there he is not free, though\nperhaps the action may be voluntary. So that the idea of LIBERTY is,\nthe idea of a power in any agent to do or forbear any particular\naction, according to the determination or thought of the mind, whereby\neither of them is preferred to the other: where either of them is not\nin the power of the agent to be produced by him according to his\nvolition, there he is not at liberty; that agent is under NECESSITY. So\nthat liberty cannot be where there is no thought, no volition, no will;\nbut there may be thought, there may be will, there may be volition,\nwhere there is no liberty. A little consideration of an obvious\ninstance or two may make this clear.\n9. Supposes Understanding and Will.\nA tennis-ball, whether in motion by the stroke of a racket, or lying\nstill at rest, is not by any one taken to be a free agent. If we\ninquire into the reason, we shall find it is because we conceive not a\ntennis-ball to think, and consequently not to have any volition, or\nPREFERENCE of motion to rest, or vice versa; and therefore has not\nliberty, is not a free agent; but all its both motion and rest come\nunder our idea of necessary, and are so called. Likewise a man falling\ninto the water, (a bridge breaking under him,) has not herein liberty,\nis not a free agent. For though he has volition, though he prefers his\nnot falling to falling; yet the forbearance of that motion not being in\nhis power, the stop or cessation of that motion follows not upon his\nvolition; and therefore therein he is not free. So a man striking\nhimself, or his friend, by a convulsive motion of his arm, which it is\nnot in his power, by volition or the direction of his mind, to stop or\nforbear, nobody thinks he has in this liberty; every one pities him, as\nacting by necessity and constraint.\n10. Belongs not to Volition.\nAgain: suppose a man be carried, whilst fast asleep, into a room where\nis a person he longs to see and speak with; and be there locked fast\nin, beyond his power to get out: he awakes, and is glad to find himself\nin so desirable company, which he stays willingly in, i. e. prefers his\nstay to going away. I ask, is not this stay voluntary? I think nobody\nwill doubt it: and yet, being locked fast in, it is evident he is not\nat liberty not to stay, he has not freedom to be gone. So that liberty\nis not an idea belonging to volition, or preferring; but to the person\nhaving the power of doing, or forbearing to do, according as the mind\nshall choose or direct. Our idea of liberty reaches as far as that\npower, and no farther. For wherever restraint comes to check that\npower, or compulsion takes away that indifferency of ability to act, or\nto forbear acting, there liberty, and our notion of it, presently\nceases.\n11. Voluntary opposed to involuntary.\nWe have instances enough, and often more than enough, in our own\nbodies. A man\u2019s heart beats, and the blood circulates, which it is not\nin his power by any thought or volition to stop; and therefore in\nrespect of these motions, where rest depends not on his choice, nor\nwould follow the determination of his mind, if it should prefer it, he\nis not a free agent. Convulsive motions agitate his legs, so that\nthough he wills it ever so much, he cannot by any power of his mind\nstop their motion, (as in that odd disease called chorea sancti viti),\nbut he is perpetually dancing; he is not at liberty in this action, but\nunder as much necessity of moving, as a stone that falls, or a\ntennis-ball struck with a racket. On the other side, a palsy or the\nstocks hinder his legs from obeying the determination of his mind, if\nit would thereby transfer his body to another place. In all these there\nis want of freedom; though the sitting still, even of a paralytic,\nwhilst he prefers it to a removal, is truly voluntary. Voluntary, then,\nis not opposed to necessary but to involuntary. For a man may prefer\nwhat he can do, to what he cannot do; the state he is in, to its\nabsence or change; though necessity has made it in itself unalterable.\n12. Liberty, what.\nAs it is in the motions of the body, so it is in the thoughts of our\nminds: where any one is such, that we have power to take it up, or lay\nit by, according to the preference of the mind, there we are at\nliberty. A waking man, being under the necessity of having some ideas\nconstantly in his mind, is not at liberty to think or not to think; no\nmore than he is at liberty, whether his body shall touch any other or\nno, but whether he will remove his contemplation from one idea to\nanother is many times in his choice; and then he is, in respect of his\nideas, as much at liberty as he is in respect of bodies he rests on; he\ncan at pleasure remove himself from one to another. But yet some ideas\nto the mind, like some motions to the body, are such as in certain\ncircumstances it cannot avoid, nor obtain their absence by the utmost\neffort it can use. A man on the rack is not at liberty to lay by the\nidea of pain, and divert himself with other contemplations: and\nsometimes a boisterous passion hurries our thoughts, as a hurricane\ndoes our bodies, without leaving us the liberty of thinking on other\nthings, which we would rather choose. But as soon as the mind regains\nthe power to stop or continue, begin or forbear, any of these motions\nof the body without, or thoughts within, according as it thinks fit to\nprefer either to the other, we then consider the man as a FREE AGENT\nagain.\n13. Wherever thought is wholly wanting, or the power to act or forbear\naccording to the direction of thought, there necessity takes place.\nThis, in an agent capable of volition, when the beginning or\ncontinuation of any action is contrary to that preference of his mind,\nis called compulsion; when the hindering or stopping any action is\ncontrary to his volition, it is called restraint. Agents that have no\nthought, no volition at all, are in everything NECESSARY AGENTS.\n14. If this be so, (as I imagine it is,) I leave it to be considered,\nwhether it may not help to put an end to that long agitated, and, I\nthink, unreasonable, because unintelligible question, viz. WHETHER\nMAN\u2019S WILL BE FREE OR NO? For if I mistake not, it follows from what I\nhave said, that the question itself is altogether improper; and it is\nas insignificant to ask whether man\u2019s WILL be free, as to ask whether\nhis sleep be swift, or his virtue square: liberty being as little\napplicable to the will, as swiftness of motion is to sleep, or\nsquareness to virtue. Every one would laugh at the absurdity of such a\nquestion as either of these: because it is obvious that the\nmodifications of motion belong not to sleep, nor the difference of\nfigure to virtue; and when any one well considers it, I think he will\nas plainly perceive that liberty, which is but a power, belongs only to\nAgents, and cannot be an attribute or modification of the will, which\nis also but a power.\n15. Volition.\nSuch is the difficulty of explaining and giving clear notions of\ninternal actions by sounds, that I must here warn my reader, that\nORDERING, DIRECTING, CHOOSING, PREFERRING, &c. which I have made use\nof, will not distinctly enough express volition, unless he will reflect\non what he himself does when he wills. For example, preferring, which\nseems perhaps best to express the act of volition, does it not\nprecisely. For though a man would prefer flying to walking, yet who can\nsay he ever wills it? Volition, it is plain, is an act of the mind\nknowingly exerting that dominion it takes itself to have over any part\nof the man, by employing it in, or withholding it from, any particular\naction. And what is the will, but the faculty to do this? And is that\nfaculty anything more in effect than a power; the power of the mind to\ndetermine its thought, to the producing, continuing, or stopping any\naction, as far as it depends on us? For can it be denied that whatever\nagent has a power to think on its own actions, and to prefer their\ndoing or omission either to other, has that faculty called will? WILL,\nthen, is nothing but such a power. LIBERTY, on the other side, is the\npower a MAN has to do or forbear doing any particular action according\nas its doing or forbearance has the actual preference in the mind;\nwhich is the same thing as to say, according as he himself wills it.\n16. Powers belonging to Agents.\nIt is plain then that the will is nothing but one power or ability, and\nFREEDOM another power or ability so that, to ask, whether the will has\nfreedom, is to ask whether one power has another power, one ability\nanother ability; a question at first sight too grossly absurd to make a\ndispute, or need an answer. For, who is it that sees not that powers\nbelong only to agents, and are attributes only of substances, and not\nof powers themselves? So that this way of putting the question (viz.\nwhether the will be free) is in effect to ask, whether the will be a\nsubstance, an agent, or at least to suppose it, since freedom can\nproperly be attributed to nothing else. If freedom can with any\npropriety of speech be applied to power, it may be attributed to the\npower that is in a man to produce, or forbear producing, motion in\nparts of his body, by choice or preference; which is that which\ndenominates him free, and is freedom itself. But if any one should ask,\nwhether freedom were free, he would be suspected not to understand well\nwhat he said; and he would be thought to deserve Midas\u2019s ears, who,\nknowing that rich was a denomination for the possession of riches,\nshould demand whether riches themselves were rich.\n17. How the will instead of the man is called free.\nHowever, the name FACULTY, which men have given to this power called\nthe will, and whereby they have been led into a way of talking of the\nwill as acting, may, by an appropriation that disguises its true sense,\nserve a little to palliate the absurdity; yet the will, in truth,\nsignifies nothing but a power or ability to prefer or choose: and when\nthe will, under the name of a faculty, is considered as it is, barely\nas an ability to do something, the absurdity in saying it is free, or\nnot free, will easily discover itself. For, if it be reasonable to\nsuppose and talk of faculties as distinct beings that can act, (as we\ndo, when we say the will orders, and the will is free,) it is fit that\nwe should make a speaking faculty, and a walking faculty, and a dancing\nfaculty, by which these actions are produced, which are but several\nmodes of motion; as well as we make the will and understanding to be\nfaculties, by which the actions of choosing and perceiving are\nproduced, which are but several modes of thinking. And we may as\nproperly say that it is the singing faculty sings, and the dancing\nfaculty dances, as that the will chooses, or that the understanding\nconceives; or, as is usual, that the will directs the understanding, or\nthe understanding obeys or obeys not the will: it being altogether as\nproper and intelligible to say that the power of speaking directs the\npower of singing, or the power of singing obeys or disobeys the power\nof speaking.\n18. This way of talking causes confusion of thought.\nThis way of talking, nevertheless, has prevailed, and, as I guess,\nproduced great confusion. For these being all different powers in the\nmind, or in the man, to do several actions, he exerts them as he thinks\nfit: but the power to do one action is not operated on by the power of\ndoing another action. For the power of thinking operates not on the\npower of choosing, nor the power of choosing on the power of thinking;\nno more than the power of dancing operates on the power of singing, or\nthe power of singing on the power of dancing, as any one who reflects\non it will easily perceive. And yet this is it which we say when we\nthus speak, that the will operates on the understanding, or the\nunderstanding on the will.\n19. Powers are relations, not agents.\nI grant, that this or that actual thought may be the occasion of\nvolition, or exercising the power a man has to choose; or the actual\nchoice of the mind, the cause of actual thinking on this or that thing:\nas the actual singing of such a tune may be the cause of dancing such a\ndance, and the actual dancing of such a dance the occasion of singing\nsuch a tune. But in all these it is not one POWER that operates on\nanother: but it is the mind that operates, and exerts these powers; it\nis the man that does the action; it is the agent that has power, or is\nable to do. For powers are relations, not agents: and that which has\nthe power or not the power to operate, is that alone which is or is not\nfree, and not the power itself. For freedom, or not freedom, can belong\nto nothing but what has or has not a power to act.\n20. Liberty belongs not to the Will.\nThe attributing to faculties that which belonged not to them, has given\noccasion to this way of talking: but the introducing into discourses\nconcerning the mind, with the name of faculties, a notion of THEIR\noperating, has, I suppose, as little advanced our knowledge in that\npart of ourselves, as the great use and mention of the like invention\nof faculties, in the operations of the body, has helped us in the\nknowledge of physic. Not that I deny there are faculties, both in the\nbody and mind: they both of them have their powers of operating, else\nneither the one nor the other could operate. For nothing can operate\nthat is not able to operate; and that is not able to operate that has\nno power to operate. Nor do I deny that those words, and the like, are\nto have their place in the common use of languages that have made them\ncurrent. It looks like too much affectation wholly to lay them by: and\nphilosophy itself, though it likes not a gaudy dress, yet, when it\nappears in public, must have so much complacency as to be clothed in\nthe ordinary fashion and language of the country, so far as it can\nconsist with truth and perspicuity. But the fault has been, that\nfaculties have been spoken of and represented as so many distinct\nagents. For, it being asked, what it was that digested the meat in our\nstomachs? it was a ready and very satisfactory answer to say, that it\nwas the DIGESTIVE FACULTY. What was it that made anything come out of\nthe body? the EXPULSIVE FACULTY. What moved? the MOTIVE FACULTY. And so\nin the mind, the INTELLECTUAL FACULTY, or the understanding,\nunderstood; and the ELECTIVE FACULTY, or the will, willed or commanded.\nThis is, in short, to say, that the ability to digest, digested; and\nthe ability to move, moved; and the ability to understand, understood.\nFor faculty, ability, and power, I think, are but different names of\nthe same things: which ways of speaking, when put into more\nintelligible words, will, I think, amount to thus much;\u2014That digestion\nis performed by something that is able to digest, motion by something\nable to move, and understanding by something able to understand. And,\nin truth, it would be very strange if it should be otherwise; as\nstrange as it would be for a man to be free without being able to be\nfree.\n21. But to the Agent, or Man.\nTo return, then, to the inquiry about liberty, I think the question is\nnot proper, WHETHER THE WILL BE FREE, but WHETHER A MAN BE FREE. Thus,\nI think,\nFirst, That so far as any one can, by the direction or choice of his\nmind, preferring the existence of any action to the non-existence of\nthat action, and vice versa, make IT to exist or not exist, so far HE\nis free. For if I can, by a thought directing the motion of my finger,\nmake it move when it was at rest, or vice versa, it is evident, that in\nrespect of that I am free: and if I can, by a like thought of my mind,\npreferring one to the other, produce either words or silence, I am at\nliberty to speak or hold my peace: and as far as this power reaches, of\nacting or not acting, by the determination of his own thought\npreferring either, so far is a man free. For how can we think any one\nfreer, than to have the power to do what he will? And so far as any one\ncan, by preferring any action to its not being, or rest to any action,\nproduce that action or rest, so far can he do what he will. For such a\npreferring of action to its absence, is the willing of it: and we can\nscarce tell how to imagine any being freer, than to be able to do what\nhe wills. So that in respect of actions within the reach of such a\npower in him, a man seems as free as it is possible for freedom to make\nhim.\n22. In respect of willing, a Man is not free.\nBut the inquisitive mind of man, willing to shift off from himself, as\nfar as he can, all thoughts of guilt, though it be by putting himself\ninto a worse state than that of fatal necessity, is not content with\nthis: freedom, unless it reaches further than this, will not serve the\nturn: and it passes for a good plea, that a man is not free at all, if\nhe be not as FREE TO WILL as he is to ACT WHAT HE WILLS. Concerning a\nman\u2019s liberty, there yet, therefore, is raised this further question,\nWHETHER A MAN BE FREE TO WILL? which I think is what is meant, when it\nis disputed whether the will be free. And as to that I imagine.\n23. How a man cannot be free to will.\nSecondly, That willing, or volition, being an action, and freedom\nconsisting in a power of acting or not acting, a man in respect of\nwilling or the act of volition, when any action in his power is once\nproposed to his thoughts, as presently to be done, cannot be free. The\nreason whereof is very manifest. For, it being unavoidable that the\naction depending on his will should exist or not exist, and its\nexistence or not existence following perfectly the determination and\npreference of his will, he cannot avoid willing the existence or\nnon-existence of that action; it is absolutely necessary that he will\nthe one or the other; i.e. prefer the one to the other: since one of\nthem must necessarily follow; and that which does follow follows by the\nchoice and determination of his mind; that is, by his willing it: for\nif he did not will it, it would not be. So that, in respect of the act\nof willing, a man is not free: liberty consisting in a power to act or\nnot to act; which, in regard of volition, a man, has not.\n24. Liberty is freedom to execute what is willed.\nThis, then, is evident, That A MAN IS NOT AT LIBERTY TO WILL, OR NOT TO\nWILL, ANYTHING IN HIS POWER THAT HE ONCE CONSIDERS OF: liberty\nconsisting in a power to act or to forbear acting, and in that only.\nFor a man that sits still is said yet to be at liberty; because he can\nwalk if he wills it. A man that walks is at liberty also, not because\nhe walks or moves; but because he can stand still if he wills it. But\nif a man sitting still has not a power to remove himself, he is not at\nliberty; so likewise a man falling down a precipice, though in motion,\nis not at liberty, because he cannot stop that motion if he would. This\nbeing so, it is plain that a man that is walking, to whom it is\nproposed to give off walking, is not at liberty, whether he will\ndetermine himself to walk, or give off walking or not: he must\nnecessarily prefer one or the other of them; walking or not walking.\nAnd so it is in regard of all other actions in our power; they being\nonce proposed, the mind has not a power to act or not to act, wherein\nconsists liberty. The mind, in that case, has not a power to forbear\nWILLING; it cannot avoid some determination concerning them, let the\nconsideration be as short, the thought as quick as it will, it either\nleaves the man in the state he was before thinking, or changes it;\ncontinues the action, or puts an end to it. Whereby it is manifest,\nthat IT orders and directs one, in preference to, or with neglect of\nthe other, and thereby either the continuation or change becomes\nUNAVOIDABLY voluntary.\n25. The Will determined by something without it.\nSince then it is plain that, in most cases, a man is not at liberty,\nwhether he will or no, (for, when an action in his power is proposed to\nhis thoughts, he CANNOT forbear volition; he MUST determine one way or\nthe other;) the next thing demanded is,\u2014WHETHER A MAN BE AT LIBERTY TO\nWILL WHICH OF THE TWO HE PLEASES, MOTION OR REST? This question carries\nthe absurdity of it so manifestly in itself, that one might thereby\nsufficiently be convinced that liberty concerns not the will. For, to\nask whether a man be at liberty to will either motion or rest, speaking\nor silence, which he pleases, is to ask whether a man can will what he\nwills, or be pleased with what he is pleased with? A question which, I\nthink, needs no answer: and they who can make a question of it must\nsuppose one will to determine the acts of another, and another to\ndetermine that, and so on in infinitum.\n26. The ideas of LIBERTY and VOLITION must be defined.\nTo avoid these and the like absurdities, nothing can be of greater use\nthan to establish in our minds determined ideas of the things under\nconsideration. If the ideas of liberty and volition were well fixed in\nour understandings, and carried along with us in our minds, as they\nought, through all the questions that are raised about them, I suppose\na great part of the difficulties that perplex men\u2019s thoughts, and\nentangle their understandings, would be much easier resolved; and we\nshould perceive where the confused signification of terms, or where the\nnature of the thing caused the obscurity.\n27. Freedom.\nFirst, then, it is carefully to be remembered, That freedom consists in\nthe dependence of the existence, or not existence of any ACTION, upon\nour VOLITION of it; and not in the dependence of any action, or its\ncontrary, on our PREFERENCE. A man standing on a cliff, is at liberty\nto leap twenty yards downwards into the sea, not because he has a power\nto do the contrary action, which is to leap twenty yards upwards, for\nthat he cannot do; but he is therefore free, because he has a power to\nleap or not to leap. But if a greater force than his, either holds him\nfast, or tumbles him down, he is no longer free in that case; because\nthe doing or forbearance of that particular action is no longer in his\npower. He that is a close prisoner in a room twenty feet square, being\nat the north side of his chamber, is at liberty to walk twenty feet\nsouthward, because he can walk or not walk it; but is not, at the same\ntime, at liberty to do the contrary, i.e. to walk twenty feet\nnorthward.\nIn this, then, consists FREEDOM, viz. in our being able to act or not\nto act, according as we shall choose or will.\n28. What Volition and action mean.\nSecondly, we must remember, that VOLITION or WILLING is an act of the\nmind directing its thought to the production of any action, and thereby\nexerting its power to produce it. To avoid multiplying of words, I\nwould crave leave here, under the word ACTION, to comprehend the\nforbearance too of any action proposed: sitting still, or holding one\u2019s\npeace, when walking or speaking are proposed, though mere forbearances,\nrequiring as much the determination of the will, and being as often\nweighty in their consequences, as the contrary actions, may, on that\nconsideration, well enough pass for actions too: but this I say, that I\nmay not be mistaken, if (for brevity\u2019s sake) I speak thus.\n29. What determines the Will.\nThirdly, the will being nothing but a power in the mind to direct the\noperative faculties of a man to motion or rest as far as they depend on\nsuch direction; to the question, What is it determines the will? the\ntrue and proper answer is, The mind. For that which determines the\ngeneral power of directing, to this or that particular direction, is\nnothing but the agent itself exercising the power it has that\nparticular way. If this answer satisfies not, it is plain the meaning\nof the question, What determines the will? is this,\u2014What moves the\nmind, in every particular instance, to determine its general power of\ndirecting, to this or that particular motion or rest? And to this I\nanswer,\u2014The motive for continuing in the same state or action, is only\nthe present satisfaction in it; the motive to change is always some\nuneasiness: nothing setting us upon the change of state, or upon any\nnew action, but some uneasiness. This is the great motive that works on\nthe mind to put it upon action, which for shortness\u2019 sake we will call\ndetermining of the will, which I shall more at large explain.\n30. Will and Desire must not be confounded.\nBut, in the way to it, it will be necessary to premise, that, though I\nhave above endeavoured to express the act of volition, by CHOOSING,\nPREFERRING, and the like terms, that signify desire as well as\nvolition, for want of other words to mark that act of the mind whose\nproper name is WILLING or VOLITION; yet, it being a very simple act,\nwhosoever desires to understand what it is, will better find it by\nreflecting on his own mind, and observing what it does when it wills,\nthan by any variety of articulate sounds whatsoever. This caution of\nbeing careful not to be misled by expressions that do not enough keep\nup the difference between the WILL and several acts of the mind that\nare quite distinct from it, I think the more necessary, because I find\nthe will often confounded with several of the affections, especially\nDESIRE, and one put for the other; and that by men who would not\nwillingly be thought not to have had very distinct notions of things,\nand not to have writ very clearly about them. This, I imagine, has been\nno small occasion of obscurity and mistake in this matter; and\ntherefore is, as much as may be, to be avoided. For he that shall turn\nhis thoughts inwards upon what passes in his mind when he wills, shall\nsee that the will or power of volition is conversant about nothing but\nour own ACTIONS; terminates there; and reaches no further; and that\nvolition is nothing but that particular determination of the mind,\nwhereby, barely by a thought, the mind endeavours to give rise,\ncontinuation, or stop, to any action which it takes to be in its power.\nThis, well considered, plainly shows that the will is perfectly\ndistinguished from desire; which, in the very same action, may have a\nquite contrary tendency from that which our will sets us upon. A man,\nwhom I cannot deny, may oblige me to use persuasions to another, which,\nat the same time I am speaking, I may wish may not prevail on him. In\nthis case, it is plain the will and desire run counter. I will the\naction; that tends one way, whilst my desire tends another, and that\nthe direct contrary way. A man who, by a violent fit of the gout in his\nlimbs, finds a doziness in his head, or a want of appetite in his\nstomach removed, desires to be eased too of the pain of his feet or\nhands, (for wherever there is pain, there is a desire to be rid of it,)\nthough yet, whilst he apprehends that the removal of the pain may\ntranslate the noxious humour to a more vital part, his will is never\ndetermined to any one action that may serve to remove this pain. Whence\nit is evident that desiring and willing are two distinct acts of the\nmind; and consequently, that the will, which is but the power of\nvolition, is much more distinct from desire.\n31. Uneasiness determines the Will.\nTo return, then, to the inquiry, what is it that determines the will in\nregard to our actions? And that, upon second thoughts, I am apt to\nimagine is not, as is generally supposed, the greater good in view; but\nsome (and for the most part the most pressing) UNEASINESS a man is at\npresent under. This is that which successively determines the will, and\nsets us upon those actions we perform. This uneasiness we may call, as\nit is, DESIRE; which is an uneasiness of the mind for want of some\nabsent good. All pain of the body, of what sort soever, and disquiet of\nthe mind, is uneasiness: and with this is always joined desire, equal\nto the pain or uneasiness felt; and is scarce distinguishable from it.\nFor desire being nothing but an uneasiness in the want of an absent\ngood, in reference to any pain felt, ease is that absent good; and till\nthat ease be attained, we may call it desire; nobody feeling pain that\nhe wishes not to be eased of, with a desire equal to that pain, and\ninseparable from it. Besides this desire of ease from pain, there is\nanother of absent positive good; and here also the desire and\nuneasiness are equal. As much as we desire any absent good, so much are\nwe in pain for it. But here all absent good does not, according to the\ngreatness it has, or is acknowledged to have, cause pain equal to that\ngreatness; as all pain causes desire equal to itself: because the\nabsence of good is not always a pain, as the presence of pain is. And\ntherefore absent good may be looked on and considered without desire.\nBut so much as there is anywhere of desire, so much there is of\nuneasiness.\n32. Desire is Uneasiness.\nThat desire is a state of uneasiness, every one who reflects on himself\nwill quickly find. Who is there that has not felt in desire what the\nwise man says of hope, (which is not much different from it,) that it\nbeing \u2018deferred makes the heart sick\u2019; and that still proportionable to\nthe greatness of the desire, which sometimes raises the uneasiness to\nthat pitch, that it makes people cry out, \u2018Give me children,\u2019 give me\nthe thing desired, \u2018or I die.\u2019 Life itself, and all its enjoyments, is\na burden cannot be borne under the lasting and unremoved pressure of\nsuch an uneasiness.\n33. The Uneasiness of Desire determines the Will.\nGood and evil, present and absent, it is true, work upon the mind. But\nthat which IMMEDIATELY determines the will from time to time, to every\nvoluntary action, is the UNEASINESS OF DESIRE, fixed on some absent\ngood: either negative, as indolence to one in pain; or positive, as\nenjoyment of pleasure. That it is this uneasiness that determines the\nwill to the successive voluntary actions, whereof the greatest part of\nour lives is made up, and by which we are conducted through different\ncourses to different ends, I shall endeavour to show, both from\nexperience, and the reason of the thing.\n34. This is the Spring of Action.\nWhen a man is perfectly content with the state he is in\u2014which is when\nhe is perfectly without any uneasiness\u2014what industry, what action, what\nwill is there left, but to continue in it? Of this every man\u2019s\nobservation will satisfy him. And thus we see our all-wise Maker,\nsuitably to our constitution and frame, and knowing what it is that\ndetermines the will, has put into man the uneasiness of hunger and\nthirst, and other natural desires, that return at their seasons, to\nmove and determine their wills, for the preservation of themselves, and\nthe continuation of their species. For I think we may conclude, that,\nif the BARE CONTEMPLATION of these good ends to which we are carried by\nthese several uneasinesses had been sufficient to determine the will,\nand set us on work, we should have had none of these natural pains, and\nperhaps in this world little or no pain at all. \u2018It is better to marry\nthan to burn,\u2019 says St. Paul, where we may see what it is that chiefly\ndrives men into the enjoyments of a conjugal life. A little burning\nfelt pushes us more powerfully than greater pleasure in prospect draw\nor allure.\n35. The greatest positive Good determines not the Will, but present\nUneasiness alone.\nIt seems so established and settled a maxim, by the general consent of\nall mankind, that good, the greater good, determines the will, that I\ndo not at all wonder that, when I first published my thoughts on this\nsubject I took it for granted; and I imagine that, by a great many, I\nshall be thought more excusable for having then done so, than that now\nI have ventured to recede from so received an opinion. But yet, upon a\nstricter inquiry, I am forced to conclude that GOOD, the GREATER GOOD,\nthough apprehended and acknowledged to be so, does not determine the\nwill, until our desire, raised proportionably to it, makes us uneasy in\nthe want of it. Convince a man never so much, that plenty has its\nadvantages over poverty; make him see and own, that the handsome\nconveniences of life are better than nasty penury: yet, as long as he\nis content with the latter, and finds no uneasiness in it, he moves\nnot; his will never is determined to any action that shall bring him\nout of it. Let a man be ever so well persuaded of the advantages of\nvirtue, that it is as necessary to a man who has any great aims in this\nworld, or hopes in the next, as food to life: yet, till he hungers or\nthirsts after righteousness, till he FEELS AN UNEASINESS in the want of\nit, his WILL will not be determined to any action in pursuit of this\nconfessed greater good; but any other uneasiness he feels in himself\nshall take place, and carry his will to other actions. On the other\nside, let a drunkard see that his health decays, his estate wastes;\ndiscredit and diseases, and the want of all things, even of his beloved\ndrink, attends him in the course he follows: yet the returns of\nuneasiness to miss his companions, the habitual thirst after his cups\nat the usual time, drives him to the tavern, though he has in his view\nthe loss of health and plenty, and perhaps of the joys of another life:\nthe least of which is no inconsiderable good, but such as he confesses\nis far greater than the tickling of his palate with a glass of wine, or\nthe idle chat of a soaking club. It is not want of viewing the greater\ngood: for he sees and acknowledges it, and, in the intervals of his\ndrinking hours, will take resolutions to pursue the greater good; but\nwhen the uneasiness to miss his accustomed delight returns, the greater\nacknowledged good loses its hold, and the present uneasiness determines\nthe will to the accustomed action; which thereby gets stronger footing\nto prevail against the next occasion, though he at the same time makes\nsecret promises to himself that he will do so no more; this is the last\ntime he will act against the attainment of those greater goods. And\nthus he is, from time to time, in the state of that unhappy complainer,\nVideo meliora, proboque, deteriora sequor: which sentence, allowed for\ntrue, and made good by constant experience, may in this, and possibly\nno other way, be easily made intelligible.\n36. Because the Removal of Uneasiness is the first Step to Happiness.\nIf we inquire into the reason of what experience makes so evident in\nfact, and examine, why it is uneasiness alone operates on the will, and\ndetermines it in its choice, we shall find that, we being capable but\nof one determination of the will to one action at once, the present\nuneasiness that we are under does NATURALLY determine the will, in\norder to that happiness which we all aim at in all our actions. For, as\nmuch as whilst we are under any uneasiness, we cannot apprehend\nourselves happy, or in the way to it; pain and uneasiness being, by\nevery one, concluded and felt to be inconsistent with happiness,\nspoiling the relish even of those good things which we have: a little\npain serving to mar all the pleasure we rejoiced in. And, therefore,\nthat which of course determines the choice of our will to the next\naction will always be\u2014the removing of pain, as long as we have any\nleft, as the first and necessary step towards happiness.\n37. Because Uneasiness alone is present.\nAnother reason why it is uneasiness alone determines the will, is this:\nbecause that alone is present and, it is against the nature of things,\nthat what is absent should operate where it is not. It may be said that\nabsent good may, by contemplation, be brought home to the mind and made\npresent. The idea of it indeed may be in the mind and viewed as present\nthere; but nothing will be in the mind as a present good, able to\ncounterbalance the removal of any uneasiness which we are under, till\nit raises our desire; and the uneasiness of that has the prevalency in\ndetermining the will. Till then, the idea in the mind of whatever is\ngood is there only, like other ideas, the object of bare unactive\nspeculation; but operates not on the will, nor sets us on work; the\nreason whereof I shall show by and by. How many are to be found that\nhave had lively representations set before their minds of the\nunspeakable joys of heaven, which they acknowledge both possible and\nprobable too, who yet would be content to take up with their happiness\nhere? And so the prevailing uneasiness of their desires, let loose\nafter the enjoyments of this life, take their turns in the determining\ntheir wills; and all that while they take not one step, are not one jot\nmoved, towards the good things of another life, considered as ever so\ngreat.\n38. Because all who allow the Joys of Heaven possible, pursue them not.\nWere the will determined by the views of good, as it appears in\ncontemplation greater or less to the understanding, which is the state\nof all absent good, and that which, in the received opinion, the will\nis supposed to move to, and to be moved by,\u2014I do not see how it could\never get loose from the infinite eternal joys of heaven, once proposed\nand considered as possible. For, all absent good, by which alone,\nbarely proposed, and coming in view, the will is thought to be\ndetermined, and so to set us on action, being only possible, but not\ninfallibly certain, it is unavoidable that the infinitely greater\npossible good should regularly and constantly determine the will in all\nthe successive actions it directs; and then we should keep constantly\nand steadily in our course towards heaven, without ever standing still,\nor directing our actions to any other end: the eternal condition of a\nfuture state infinitely outweighing the expectation of riches, or\nhonour, or any other worldly pleasure which we can propose to\nourselves, though we should grant these the more probable to be\nobtained: for nothing future is yet in possession, and so the\nexpectation even of these may deceive us. If it were so that the\ngreater good in view determines the will, so great a good, once\nproposed, could not but seize the will, and hold it fast to the pursuit\nof this infinitely greatest good, without ever letting it go again: for\nthe will having a power over, and directing the thoughts, as well as\nother actions, would, if it were so, hold the contemplation of the mind\nfixed to that good.\n39. But any great Uneasiness is never neglected.\nThis would be the state of the mind, and regular tendency of the will\nin all its determinations, were it determined by that which is\nconsidered and in view the greater good. But that it is not so, is\nvisible in experience; the infinitely greatest confessed good being\noften neglected, to satisfy the successive uneasiness of our desires\npursuing trifles. But, though the greatest allowed, even everlasting\nunspeakable, good, which has sometimes moved and affected the mind,\ndoes not stedfastly hold the will, yet we see any very great and\nprevailing uneasiness having once laid hold on the will, let it not go;\nby which we may be convinced, what it is that determines the will. Thus\nany vehement pain of the body; the ungovernable passion of a man\nviolently in love; or the impatient desire of revenge, keeps the will\nsteady and intent; and the will, thus determined, never lets the\nunderstanding lay by the object, but all the thoughts of the mind and\npowers of the body are uninterruptedly employed that way, by the\ndetermination of the will, influenced by that topping uneasiness, as\nlong as it lasts; whereby it seems to me evident, that the will, or\npower of setting us upon one action in preference to all others, is\ndetermined in us by uneasiness: and whether this be not so, I desire\nevery one to observe in himself.\n40. Desire accompanies all Uneasiness.\nI have hitherto chiefly instanced in the UNEASINESS of desire, as that\nwhich determines the will: because that is the chief and most sensible;\nand the will seldom orders any action, nor is there any voluntary\naction performed, without some desire accompanying it; which I think is\nthe reason why the will and desire are so often confounded. But yet we\nare not to look upon the uneasiness which makes up, or at least\naccompanies, most of the other passions, as wholly excluded in the\ncase. Aversion, fear, anger, envy, shame, &c. have each their\nuneasinesses too, and thereby influence the will. These passions are\nscarce any of them, in life and practice, simple and alone, and wholly\nunmixed with others; though usually, in discourse and contemplation,\nthat carries the name which operates strongest, and appears most in the\npresent state of the mind. Nay, there is, I think, scarce any of the\npassions to be found without desire joined with it. I am sure wherever\nthere is uneasiness, there is desire. For we constantly desire\nhappiness; and whatever we feel of uneasiness, so much it is certain we\nwant of happiness; even in our own opinion, let our state and condition\notherwise be what it will. Besides, the present moment not being our\neternity, whatever our enjoyment be, we look beyond the present, and\ndesire goes with our foresight, and that still carries the will with\nit. So that even in joy itself, that which keeps up the action whereon\nthe enjoyment depends, is the desire to continue it, and fear to lose\nit: and whenever a greater uneasiness than that takes place in the\nmind, the will presently is by that determined to some new action, and\nthe present delight neglected.\n41. The most pressing Uneasiness naturally determines the Will.\nBut we being in this world beset with sundry uneasinesses, distracted\nwith different desires, the next inquiry naturally will be,\u2014Which of\nthem has the precedency in determining the will to the next action? and\nto that the answer is,\u2014That ordinarily which is the most pressing of\nthose that are judged capable of being then removed. For, the will\nbeing the power of directing our operative faculties to some action,\nfor some end, cannot at any time be moved towards what is judged at\nthat time unattainable: that would be to suppose an intelligent being\ndesignedly to act for an end, only to lose its labour; for so it is to\nact for what is judged not attainable; and therefore very great\nuneasinesses move not the will, when they are judged not capable of a\ncure: they in that case put us not upon endeavours. But, these set\napart the most important and urgent uneasiness we at that time feel, is\nthat which ordinarily determines the will, successively, in that train\nof voluntary actions which makes up our lives. The greatest present\nuneasiness is the spur to action, that is constantly most felt, and for\nthe most part determines the will in its choice of the next action. For\nthis we must carry along with us, that the proper and only object of\nthe will is some action of ours, and nothing else. For we producing\nnothing by our willing it, but some action in our power, it is there\nthe will terminates, and reaches no further.\n42. All desire Happiness.\nIf it be further asked,\u2014What it is moves desire? I answer,\u2014happiness,\nand that alone. Happiness and misery are the names of two extremes, the\nutmost bounds whereof we know not; it is what be in itself good; and\nwhat is apt to produce any degree of pain be evil; yet it often happens\nthat we do not call it so when it comes in competition with a greater\nof its sort; because, when they come in competition, the degrees also\nof pleasure and pain have justly a preference. So that if we will\nrightly estimate what we call good and evil, we shall find it lies much\nin comparison: for the cause of every less degree of pain, as well as\nevery greater degree of pleasure, has the nature of good, and vice\nversa.\n43. [* missing]\n44. What Good is desired, what not.\nThough this be that which is called good and evil, and all good be the\nproper object of desire in general; yet all good, even seen and\nconfessed to be so, does not necessarily move every particular man\u2019s\ndesire; but only that part, or so much of it as is considered and taken\nto make a necessary part of HIS happiness. All other good, however\ngreat in reality or appearance, excites not a man\u2019s desires who looks\nnot on it to make a part of that happiness wherewith he, in his present\nthoughts, can satisfy himself. Happiness, under this view, every one\nconstantly pursues, and desires what makes any part of it: other\nthings, acknowledged to be good, he can look upon without desire, pass\nby, and be content without. There is nobody, I think, so senseless as\nto deny that there is pleasure in knowledge: and for the pleasures of\nsense, they have too many followers to let it be questioned whether men\nare taken with them or no. Now, let one man place his satisfaction in\nsensual pleasures, another in the delight of knowledge: though each of\nthem cannot but confess, there is great pleasure in what the other\npursues; yet, neither of them making the other\u2019s delight a part of HIS\nhappiness, their desires are not moved, but each is satisfied without\nwhat the other enjoys; and so his will is not determined to the pursuit\nof it. But yet, as soon as the studious man\u2019s hunger and thirst make\nhim uneasy, he, whose will was never determined to any pursuit of good\ncheer, poignant sauces, delicious wine, by the pleasant taste he has\nfound in them, is, by the uneasiness of hunger and thirst, presently\ndetermined to eating and drinking, though possibly with great\nindifferency, what wholesome food comes in his way. And, on the other\nside, the epicure buckles to study, when shame, or the desire to\nrecommend himself to his mistress, shall make him uneasy in the want of\nany sort of knowledge. Thus, how much soever men are in earnest and\nconstant in pursuit of happiness, yet they may have a clear view of\ngood, great and confessed good, without being concerned for it, or\nmoved by it, if they think they can make up their happiness without it.\nThough as to pain, THAT they are always concerned for; they can feel no\nuneasiness without being moved. And therefore, being uneasy in the want\nof whatever is judged necessary to their happiness, as soon as any good\nappears to make a part of their portion of happiness, they begin to\ndesire it.\n45. Why the greatest Good is not always desired.\nThis, I think, any one may observe in himself and others,\u2014That the\ngreater visible good does not always raise men\u2019s desires in proportion\nto the greatness it appears, and is acknowledged, to have: though every\nlittle trouble moves us, and sets us on work to get rid of it. The\nreason whereof is evident from the nature of our happiness and misery\nitself. All present pain, whatever it be, makes a part of our present\nmisery: but all absent good does not at any time make a necessary part\nof our present happiness, nor the absence of it make a part of our\nmisery. If it did, we should be constantly and infinitely miserable;\nthere being infinite degrees of happiness which are not in our\npossession. All uneasiness therefore being removed, a moderate portion\nof good serve at present to content men; and a few degrees of pleasure\nin a succession of ordinary enjoyments, make up a happiness wherein\nthey can be satisfied. If this were not so, there could be no room for\nthose indifferent and visibly trifling actions, to which our wills are\nso often determined, and wherein we voluntarily waste so much of our\nlives; which remissness could by no means consist with a constant\ndetermination of will or desire to the greatest apparent good. That\nthis is so, I think few people need go far from home to be convinced.\nAnd indeed in this life there are not many whose happiness reaches so\nfar as to afford them a constant train of moderate mean pleasures,\nwithout any mixture of uneasiness; and yet they could be content to\nstay here for ever: though they cannot deny, but that it is possible\nthere may be a state of eternal durable joys after this life, far\nsurpassing all the good that is to be found here. Nay, they cannot but\nsee that it is more possible than the attainment and continuation of\nthat pittance of honour, riches, or pleasure which they pursue, and for\nwhich they neglect that eternal state. But yet, in full view of this\ndifference, satisfied of the possibility of a perfect, secure, and\nlasting happiness in a future state, and under a clear conviction that\nit is not to be had here,\u2014whilst they bound their happiness within some\nlittle enjoyment or aim of this life, and exclude the joys of heaven\nfrom making any necessary part of it,\u2014their desires are not moved by\nthis greater apparent good, nor their wills determined to any action,\nor endeavour for its attainment.\n46. Why not being desired, it moves not the Will.\nThe ordinary necessities of our lives fill a great part of them with\nthe uneasinesses of hunger, thirst, heat, cold, weariness, with labour,\nand sleepiness, in their constant returns, &c. To which, if, besides\naccidental harms, we add the fantastical uneasiness (as itch after\nhonour, power, or riches, &c.) which acquired habits, by fashion,\nexample, and education, have settled in us, and a thousand other\nirregular desires, which custom has made natural to us, we shall find\nthat a very little part of our life is so vacant from THESE\nuneasinesses, as to leave us free to the attraction of remoter absent\ngood. We are seldom at ease, and free enough from the solicitation of\nour natural or adopted desires, but a constant succession of\nuneasinesses out of that stock which natural wants or acquired habits\nhave heaped up, take the will in their turns; and no sooner is one\naction dispatched, which by such a determination of the will we are set\nupon, but another uneasiness is ready to set us on work. For, the\nremoving of the pains we feel, and are at present pressed with, being\nthe getting out of misery, and consequently the first thing to be done\nin order to happiness,\u2014absent good, though thought on, confessed, and\nappearing to be good, not making any part of this unhappiness in its\nabsence, is justled out, to make way for the removal of those\nuneasinesses we feel; till due and repeated contemplation has brought\nit nearer to our mind, given some relish of it, and raised in us some\ndesire: which then beginning to make a part of our present uneasiness,\nstands upon fair terms with the rest to be satisfied, and so, according\nto its greatness and pressure, comes in its turn to determine the will.\n47. Due Consideration raises Desire.\nAnd thus, by a due consideration, and examining any good proposed, it\nis in our power to raise our desires in a due proportion to the value\nof that good, whereby in its turn and place it may come to work upon\nthe will, and be pursued. For good, though appearing and allowed ever\nso great, yet till it has raised desires in our minds, and thereby made\nus uneasy in its want, it reaches not our wills; we are not within the\nsphere of its activity, our wills being under the determination only of\nthose uneasinesses which are present to us, which (whilst we have any)\nare always soliciting, and ready at hand, to give the will its next\ndetermination. The balancing, when there is any in the mind, being\nonly, which desire shall be next satisfied, which uneasiness first\nremoved. Whereby it comes to pass that, as long as any uneasiness, any\ndesire, remains in our mind, there is no room for good, barely as such,\nto come at the will, or at all to determine it. Because, as has been\nsaid, the FIRST step in our endeavours after happiness being to get\nwholly out of the confines of misery, and to feel no part of it, the\nwill can be at leisure for nothing else, till every uneasiness we feel\nbe perfectly removed: which, in the multitude of wants and desires we\nare beset with in this imperfect state, we are not like to be ever\nfreed from in this world.\n48. The Power to suspend the Prosecution of any Desire makes way for\nconsideration.\nThere being in us a great many uneasinesses, always soliciting and\nready to determine the will, it is natural, as I have said, that the\ngreatest and most pressing should determine the will to the next\naction; and so it does for the most part, but not always. For, the mind\nhaving in most cases, as is evident in experience, a power to SUSPEND\nthe execution and satisfaction of any of its desires; and so all, one\nafter another; is at liberty to consider the objects of them, examine\nthem on all sides, and weigh them with others. In this lies the liberty\nman has; and from the not using of it right comes all that variety of\nmistakes, errors, and faults which we run into in the conduct of our\nlives, and our endeavours after happiness; whilst we precipitate the\ndetermination of our wills, and engage too soon, before due\nexamination. To prevent this, we have a power to suspend the\nprosecution of this or that desire; as every one daily may experiment\nin himself. This seems to me the source of all liberty; in this seems\nto consist that which is (as I think improperly) called FREE-WILL. For,\nduring this suspension of any desire, before the will be determined to\naction, and the action (which follows that determination) done, we have\nopportunity to examine, view, and judge of the good or evil of what we\nare going to do; and when, upon due examination, we have judged, we\nhave done our duty, all that we can, or ought to do, in pursuit of our\nhappiness; and it is not a fault, but a perfection of our nature, to\ndesire, will, and act according to the last result of a fair\nexamination.\n49. To be determined by our own Judgment, is no Restraint to Liberty.\nThis is so far from being a restraint or diminution of freedom, that it\nis the very improvement and benefit of it; it is not an abridgment, it\nis the end and use of our liberty; and the further we are removed from\nsuch a determination, the nearer we are to misery and slavery. A\nperfect indifference in the mind, not determinable by its last judgment\nof the good or evil that is thought to attend its choice, would be so\nfar from being an advantage and excellency of any intellectual nature,\nthat it would be as great an imperfection, as the want of indifferency\nto act, or not to act, till determined by the will, would be an\nimperfection on the other side. A man is at liberty to lift up his hand\nto his head, or let it rest quiet: he is perfectly indifferent in\neither; and it would be an imperfection in him, if he wanted that\npower, if he were deprived of that indifferency. But it would be as\ngreat an imperfection, if he had the same indifferency, whether he\nwould prefer the lifting up his hand, or its remaining in rest, when it\nwould save his head or eyes from a blow he sees coming: it is as much a\nperfection, that desire, or the power of preferring, should be\ndetermined by good, as that the power of acting should be determined by\nthe will; and the certainer such determination is, the greater is the\nperfection. Nay, were we determined by anything but the last result of\nour own minds, judging of the good or evil of any action, we were not\nfree.\n50. The freest Agents are so determined.\nIf we look upon those superior beings above us, who enjoy perfect\nhappiness, we shall have reason to judge that they are more steadily\ndetermined in their choice of good than we; and yet we have no reason\nto think they are less happy, or less free, than we are. And if it were\nfit for such poor finite creatures as we are to pronounce what infinite\nwisdom and goodness could do, I think we might say, that God himself\nCANNOT choose what is not good; the freedom of the Almighty hinders not\nhis being determined by what is best.\n51. A constant Determination to a Pursuit of Happiness no Abridgment of\nLiberty.\nBut to give a right view of this mistaken part of liberty let me\nask,\u2014Would any one be a changeling, because he is less determined by\nwise considerations than a wise man? Is it worth the name of freedom to\nbe at liberty to play the fool, and draw shame and misery upon a man\u2019s\nself? If to break loose from the conduct of reason, and to want that\nrestraint of examination and judgment which keeps us from choosing or\ndoing the worse, be liberty, true liberty, madmen and fools are the\nonly freemen: but yet, I think, nobody would choose to be mad for the\nsake of such liberty, but he that is mad already. The constant desire\nof happiness, and the constraint it puts upon us to act for it, nobody,\nI think, accounts an abridgment of liberty, or at least an abridgment\nof liberty to be complained of. God Almighty himself is under the\nnecessity of being happy; and the more any intelligent being is so, the\nnearer is its approach to infinite perfection and happiness. That, in\nthis state of ignorance, we short-sighted creatures might not mistake\ntrue felicity, we are endowed with a power to suspend any particular\ndesire, and keep it from determining the will, and engaging us in\naction. This is standing still, where we are not sufficiently assured\nof the way: examination is consulting a guide. The determination of the\nwill upon inquiry, is following the direction of that guide: and he\nthat has a power to act or not to act, according as SUCH determination\ndirects, is a free agent: such determination abridges not that power\nwherein liberty consists. He that has his chains knocked off, and the\nprison doors set open to him, is perfectly at liberty, because he may\neither go or stay, as he best likes, though his preference be\ndetermined to stay, by the darkness of the night, or illness of the\nweather, or want of other lodging. He ceases not to be free; though the\ndesire of some convenience to be had there absolutely determines his\npreference, and makes him stay in his prison.\n52. The Necessity of pursuing true Happiness the Foundation of Liberty.\nAs therefore the highest perfection of intellectual nature lies in a\ncareful and constant pursuit of true and solid happiness; so the care\nof ourselves, that we mistake not imaginary for real happiness, is the\nnecessary foundation of our liberty. The stronger ties we have to an\nunalterable pursuit of happiness in general, which is our greatest\ngood, and which as such, our desires always follow, the more are we\nfree from any necessary determination of our will to any particular\naction, and from a necessary compliance with our desire, so upon any\nparticular, and then appearing preferable good, till we have duly\nexamined whether it has a tendency to, or be inconsistent with, our\nreal happiness: and therefore, till we are as much informed upon this\ninquiry as the weight of the matter, and the nature of the case\ndemands, we are, by the necessity of preferring and pursuing true\nhappiness as our greatest good, obliged to suspend the satisfaction of\nour desires in particular cases.\n53. Power to Suspend.\nThis is the hinge on which turns the LIBERTY of intellectual beings, in\ntheir constant endeavours after, and a steady prosecution of true\nfelicity,\u2014That they CAN SUSPEND this prosecution in particular cases,\ntill they have looked before them, and informed themselves whether that\nparticular thing which is then proposed or desired lie in the way to\ntheir main end, and make a real part of that which is their greatest\ngood. For, the inclination and tendency of their nature to happiness is\nan obligation and motive to them, to take care not to mistake or miss\nit; and so necessarily puts them upon caution, deliberation, and\nwariness, in the direction of their particular actions, which are the\nmeans to obtain it. Whatever necessity determines to the pursuit of\nreal bliss, the same necessity, with the same force, establishes\nsuspense, deliberation, and scrutiny of each successive desire, whether\nthe satisfaction of it does not interfere with our true happiness, and\nmislead us from it. This, as seems to me, is the great privilege of\nfinite intellectual beings; and I desire it may be well considered,\nwhether the great inlet and exercise of all the liberty men have, are\ncapable of, or can be useful to them, and that whereon depends the turn\nof their actions, does not lie in this,\u2014That they can suspend their\ndesires, and stop them from determining their wills to any action, till\nthey have duly and fairly examined the good and evil of it, as far\nforth as the weight of the thing requires. This we are able to do; and\nwhen we have done it, we have done our duty, and all that is in our\npower; and indeed all that needs. For, since the will supposes\nknowledge to guide its choice, all that we can do is to hold our wills\nundetermined, till we have examined the good and evil of what we\ndesire. What follows after that, follows in a chain of consequences,\nlinked one to another, all depending on the last determination of the\njudgment, which, whether it shall be upon a hasty and precipitate view,\nor upon a due and mature examination, is in our power; experience\nshowing us, that in most cases, we are able to suspend the present\nsatisfaction of any desire.\n54. Government of our Passions the right Improvement of Liberty.\nBut if any extreme disturbance (as sometimes it happens) possesses our\nwhole mind, as when the pain of the rack, an impetuous uneasiness, as\nof love, anger, or any other violent passion, running away with us,\nallows us not the liberty of thought, and we are not masters enough of\nour own minds to consider thoroughly and examine fairly;\u2014God, who knows\nour frailty, pities our weakness, and requires of us no more than we\nare able to do, and sees what was and what was not in our power, will\njudge as a kind and merciful Father. But the forbearance of a too hasty\ncompliance with our desires, the moderation and restraint of our\npassions, so that our understandings may be free to examine, and reason\nunbiassed, give its judgment, being that whereon a right direction of\nour conduct to true happiness depends; it is in this we should employ\nour chief care and endeavours. In this we should take pains to suit the\nrelish of our minds to the true intrinsic good or ill that is in\nthings; and not permit an allowed or supposed possible great and\nweighty good to slip out of our thoughts, without leaving any relish,\nany desire of itself there till, by a due consideration of its true\nworth, we have formed appetites in our minds suitable to it, and made\nourselves uneasy in the want of it, or in the fear of losing it. And\nhow much this is in every one\u2019s power, by making resolutions to\nhimself, such as he may keep, is easy for every one to try. Nor let any\none say, he cannot govern his passions, nor hinder them from breaking\nout, and carrying him into action; for what he can do before a prince\nor a great man, he can do alone, or in the presence of God, if he will.\n55. How Men come to pursue different, and often evil Courses.\nFrom what has been said, it is easy to give an account how it comes to\npass, that, though all men desire happiness, yet their wills carry them\nso contrarily; and consequently, some of them to what is evil. And to\nthis I say, that the various and contrary choices that men make in the\nworld do not argue that they do not all pursue good; but that the same\nthing is not good to every man alike. This variety of pursuits shows,\nthat every one does not place his happiness in the same thing, or\nchoose the same way to it. Were all the concerns of man terminated in\nthis life, why one followed study and knowledge, and another hawking\nand hunting: why one chose luxury and debauchery, and another sobriety\nand riches, would not be because every one of these did NOT aim at his\nown happiness; but because their happiness was placed in different\nthings. And therefore it was a right answer of the physician to his\npatient that had sore eyes:\u2014If you have more pleasure in the taste of\nwine than in the use of your sight, wine is good for you; but if the\npleasure of seeing be greater to you than that of drinking, wine is\nnaught.\n56. All men seek happiness, but not of the same sort.\nThe mind has a different relish, as well as the palate; and you will as\nfruitlessly endeavour to delight all men with riches or glory (which\nyet some men place their happiness in) as you would to satisfy all\nmen\u2019s hunger with cheese or lobsters; which, though very agreeable and\ndelicious fare to some, are to others extremely nauseous and offensive:\nand many persons would with reason prefer the griping of an hungry\nbelly to those dishes which are a feast to others. Hence it was, I\nthink, that the philosophers of old did in vain inquire, whether summum\nbonum consisted in riches, or bodily delights, or virtue, or\ncontemplation: and they might have as reasonably disputed, whether the\nbest relish were to be found in apples, plums, or nuts, and have\ndivided themselves into sects upon it. For, as pleasant tastes depend\nnot on the things themselves, but on their agreeableness to this or\nthat particular palate, wherein there is great variety; so the greatest\nhappiness consists in the having those things which produce the\ngreatest pleasure, and in the absence of those which cause any\ndisturbance, any pain. Now these, to different men, are very different\nthings. If, therefore, men in this life only have hope; if in this life\nonly they can enjoy, it is not strange nor unreasonable, that they\nshould seek their happiness by avoiding all things that disease them\nhere, and by pursuing all that delight them; wherein it will be no\nwonder to find variety and difference. For if there be no prospect\nbeyond the grave, the inference is certainly right\u2014\u2018Let us eat and\ndrink,\u2019 let us enjoy what we delight in, \u2018for to-morrow we shall die.\u2019\nThis, I think, may serve to show us the reason, why, though all men\u2019s\ndesires tend to happiness, yet they are not moved by the same object.\nMen may choose different things, and yet all choose right; supposing\nthem only like a company of poor insects; whereof some are bees,\ndelighted with flowers and their sweetness; others beetles, delighted\nwith other kinds of viands, which having enjoyed for a season, they\nwould cease to be, and exist no more for ever.\n57. [not in early editions]\n58. Why men choose what makes them miserable.\nWhat has been said may also discover to us the reason why men in this\nworld prefer different things, and pursue happiness by contrary\ncourses. But yet, since men are always constant and in earnest in\nmatters of happiness and misery, the question still remains, How men\ncome often to prefer the worse to the better; and to choose that,\nwhich, by their own confession, has made them miserable?\n59. The causes of this.\nTo account for the various and contrary ways men take, though all aim\nat being happy, we must consider whence the VARIOUS UNEASINESSES that\ndetermine the will, in the preference of each voluntary action, have\ntheir rise:\u2014\n1. From bodily pain.\nSome of them come from causes not in our power; such as are often the\npains of the body from want, disease, or outward injuries, as the rack,\netc.; which, when present and violent, operate for the most part\nforcibly on the will, and turn the courses of men\u2019s lives from virtue,\npiety, and religion, and what before they judged to lead to happiness;\nevery one not endeavouring, or not being able, by the contemplation of\nremote and future good, to raise in himself desires of them strong\nenough to counterbalance the uneasiness he feels in those bodily\ntorments, and to keep his will steady in the choice of those actions\nwhich lead to future happiness. A neighbouring country has been of late\na tragical theatre from which we might fetch instances, if there needed\nany, and the world did not in all countries and ages furnish examples\nenough to confirm that received observation: NECESSITAS COGIT AD\nTURPIA; and therefore there is great reason for us to pray, \u2018Lead us\nnot into temptation.\u2019\n2. From wrong Desires arising from wrong Judgments.\nOther uneasinesses arise from our desires of absent good; which desires\nalways bear proportion to, and depend on, the judgment we make, and the\nrelish we have of any absent good; in both which we are apt to be\nvariously misled, and that by our own fault.\n60. Our judgment of present Good or Evil always right.\nIn the first place, I shall consider the wrong judgments men make of\nFUTURE good and evil, whereby their desires are misled. For, as to\nPRESENT happiness and misery, when that alone comes into consideration,\nand the consequences are quite removed, a man never chooses amiss: he\nknows what best pleases him, and that he actually prefers. Things in\ntheir present enjoyment are what they seem: the apparent and real good\nare, in this case, always the same. For the pain or pleasure being just\nso great and no greater than it is felt, the present good or evil is\nreally so much as it appears. And therefore were every action of ours\nconcluded within itself, and drew no consequences after it, we should\nundoubtedly never err in our choice of good: we should always\ninfallibly prefer the best. Were the pains of honest industry, and of\nstarving with hunger and cold set together before us, nobody would be\nin doubt which to choose: were the satisfaction of a lust and the joys\nof heaven offered at once to any one\u2019s present possession, he would not\nbalance, or err in the determination of his choice.\n61. Our wrong judgments have regard to future good and evil only.\nBut since our voluntary actions carry not all the happiness and misery\nthat depend on them along with them in their present performance, but\nare the precedent causes of good and evil, which they draw after them,\nand bring upon us, when they themselves are past and cease to be; our\ndesires look beyond our present enjoyments, and carry the mind out to\nABSENT GOOD, according to the necessity which we think there is of it,\nto the making or increase of our happiness. It is our opinion of such a\nnecessity that gives it its attraction: without that, we are not moved\nby absent good. For, in this narrow scantling of capacity which we are\naccustomed to and sensible of here, wherein we enjoy but one pleasure\nat once, which, when all uneasiness is away, is, whilst it lasts,\nsufficient to make us think ourselves happy, it is not all remote and\neven apparent good that affects us. Because the indolency and enjoyment\nwe have, sufficing for our present happiness, we desire not to venture\nthe change; since we judge that we are happy already, being content,\nand that is enough. For who is content is happy. But as soon as any new\nuneasiness comes in, this happiness is disturbed, and we are set afresh\non work in the pursuit of happiness.\n62. From a wrong Judgment of what makes a necessary Part of their\nHappiness.\nTheir aptness therefore to conclude that they can be happy without it,\nis one great occasion that men often are not raised to the desire of\nthe greatest ABSENT good. For, whilst such thoughts possess them, the\njoys of a future state move them not; they have little concern or\nuneasiness about them; and the will, free from the determination of\nsuch desires, is left to the pursuit of nearer satisfactions, and to\nthe removal of those uneasinesses which it then feels, in its want of\nany longings after them. Change but a man\u2019s view of these things; let\nhim see that virtue and religion are necessary to his happiness; let\nhim look into the future state of bliss or misery, and see there God,\nthe righteous Judge, ready to \u2018render to every man according to his\ndeeds; to them who by patient continuance in well-doing seek for glory,\nand honour, and immortality, eternal life; but unto every soul that\ndoth evil, indignation and wrath, tribulation and anguish.\u2019 To him, I\nsay, who hath a prospect of the different state of perfect happiness or\nmisery that attends all men after this life, depending on their\nbehaviour here, the measures of good and evil that govern his choice\nare mightily changed. For, since nothing of pleasure and pain in this\nlife can bear any proportion to the endless happiness or exquisite\nmisery of an immortal soul hereafter, actions in his power will have\ntheir preference, not according to the transient pleasure or pain that\naccompanies or follows them here, but as they serve to secure that\nperfect durable happiness hereafter.\n63. A more particular Account of wrong Judgments.\nBut, to account more particularly for the misery that men often bring\non themselves, notwithstanding that they do all in earnest pursue\nhappiness, we must consider how things come to be represented to our\ndesires under deceitful appearances: and that is by the judgment\npronouncing wrongly concerning them. To see how far this reaches, and\nwhat are the causes of wrong judgment, we must remember that things are\njudged good or bad in a double sense:\u2014\nFirst, THAT WHICH IS PROPERLY GOOD OR BAD, IS NOTHING BUT BARELY\nPLEASURE OR PAIN.\nSecondly, But because not only present pleasure and pain, but that also\nwhich is apt by its efficacy or consequences to bring it upon us at a\ndistance, is a proper object of our desires, and apt to move a creature\nthat has foresight; therefore THINGS ALSO THAT DRAW AFTER THEM PLEASURE\nAND PAIN, ARE CONSIDERED AS GOOD AND EVIL.\n64. No one chooses misery willingly, but only by wrong judgment.\nThe wrong judgment that misleads us, and makes the will often fasten on\nthe worse side, lies in misreporting upon the various comparisons of\nthese. The wrong judgment I am here speaking of is not what one man may\nthink of the determination of another, but what every man himself must\nconfess to be wrong. For, since I lay it for a certain ground, that\nevery intelligent being really seeks happiness, which consists in the\nenjoyment of pleasure, without any considerable mixture of uneasiness;\nit is impossible any one should willingly put into his own draught any\nbitter ingredient, or leave out anything in his power that would tend\nto his satisfaction, and the completing of his happiness, but only by a\nWRONG JUDGMENT. I shall not here speak of that mistake which is the\nconsequence of INVINCIBLE error, which scarce deserves the name of\nwrong judgment; but of that wrong judgment which every man himself must\nconfess to be so.\n65. Men may err on comparing Present and Future.\n(I) Therefore, as to present pleasure and pain, the mind, as has been\nsaid, never mistakes that which is really good or evil; that which is\nthe greater pleasure, or the greater pain, is really just as it\nappears. But, though present pleasure and pain show their difference\nand degrees so plainly as not to leave room to mistake; yet, WHEN WE\nCOMPARE PRESENT PLEASURE OR PAIN WITH FUTURE, (which is usually the\ncase in most important determinations of the will,) we often make wrong\njudgments of them; taking our measures of them in different positions\nof distance. Objects near our view are apt to be thought greater than\nthose of a larger size that are more remote. And so it is with\npleasures and pains: the present is apt to carry it; and those at a\ndistance have the disadvantage in the comparison. Thus most men, like\nspendthrift heirs, are apt to judge a little in hand better than a\ngreat deal to come; and so, for small matters in possession, part with\ngreater ones in reversion. But that this is a wrong judgment every one\nmust allow, let his pleasure consist in whatever it will: since that\nwhich is future will certainly come to be present; and then, having the\nsame advantage of nearness, will show itself in its full dimensions,\nand discover his wilful mistake who judged of it by unequal measures.\nWere the pleasure of drinking accompanied, the very moment a man takes\noff his glass, with that sick stomach and aching head which, in some\nmen, are sure to follow not many hours after, I think nobody, whatever\npleasure he had in his cups, would, on these conditions, ever let wine\ntouch his lips; which yet he daily swallows, and the evil side comes to\nbe chosen only by the fallacy of a little difference in time. But, if\npleasure or pain can be so lessened only by a few hours\u2019 removal, how\nmuch more will it be so by a further distance to a man that will not,\nby a right judgment, do what time will, i. e. bring it home upon\nhimself, and consider it as present, and there take its true\ndimensions? This is the way we usually impose on ourselves, in respect\nof bare pleasure and pain, or the true degrees of happiness or misery:\nthe future loses its just proportion, and what is present obtains the\npreference as the greater. I mention not here the wrong judgment,\nwhereby the absent are not only lessened, but reduced to perfect\nnothing; when men enjoy what they can in present, and make sure of\nthat, concluding amiss that no evil will thence follow. For that lies\nnot in comparing the greatness of future good and evil, which is that\nwe are here speaking of; but in another sort of wrong judgment, which\nis concerning good or evil, as it is considered to be the cause and\nprocurement of pleasure or pain that will follow from it.\n66. Causes of our judging amiss when we compare present pleasure and\npain with future.\nThe cause of our judging amiss, when we compare our present pleasure or\npain with future, seems to me to be THE WEAK AND NARROW CONSTITUTION OF\nOUR MINDS. We cannot well enjoy two pleasures at once; much less any\npleasure almost, whilst pain possesses us. The present pleasure, if it\nbe not very languid, and almost none at all, fills our narrow souls,\nand so takes up the whole mind that it scarce leaves any thought of\nthings absent: or if among our pleasures there are some which are not\nstrong enough to exclude the consideration of things at a distance, yet\nwe have so great an abhorrence of pain, that a little of it\nextinguishes all our pleasures. A little bitter mingled in our cup,\nleaves no relish of the sweet. Hence it comes that, at any rate, we\ndesire to be rid of the present evil, which we are apt to think nothing\nabsent can equal; because, under the present pain, we find not\nourselves capable of any the least degree of happiness. Men\u2019s daily\ncomplaints are a loud proof of this: the pain that any one actually\nfeels is still of all other the worst; and it is with anguish they cry\nout,\u2014\u2018Any rather than this: nothing can be so intolerable as what I now\nsuffer.\u2019 And therefore our whole endeavours and thoughts are intent to\nget rid of the present evil, before all things, as the first necessary\ncondition to our happiness; let what will follow. Nothing, as we\npassionately think, can exceed, or almost equal, the uneasiness that\nsits so heavy upon us. And because the abstinence from a present\npleasure that offers itself is a pain, nay, oftentimes a very great\none, the desire being inflamed by a near and tempting object, it is no\nwonder that that operates after the same manner pain does, and lessens\nin our thoughts what is future; and so forces us, as it were blindfold,\ninto its embraces.\n67. Absent good unable to counterbalance present uneasiness.\nAdd to this, that absent good, or, which is the same thing, future\npleasure,\u2014especially if of a sort we are unacquainted with,\u2014seldom is\nable to counterbalance any uneasiness, either of pain or desire, which\nis present. For, its greatness being no more than what shall be really\ntasted when enjoyed, men are apt enough to lessen that; to make it give\nplace to any present desire; and conclude with themselves that, when it\ncomes to trial, it may possibly not answer the report or opinion that\ngenerally passes of it: they having often found that, not only what\nothers have magnified, but even what they themselves have enjoyed with\ngreat pleasure and delight at one time, has proved insipid or nauseous\nat another; and therefore they see nothing in it for which they should\nforego a present enjoyment. But that this is a false way of judging,\nwhen applied to the happiness of another life, they must confess;\nunless they will say, God cannot make those happy he designs to be so.\nFor that being intended for a state of happiness, it must certainly be\nagreeable to every one\u2019s wish and desire: could we suppose their\nrelishes as different there as they are here, yet the manna in heaven\nwill suit every one\u2019s palate. Thus much of the wrong judgment we make\nof present and future pleasure and pain, when they are compared\ntogether, and so the absent considered as future.\n68. Wrong judgment in considering Consequences of Actions.\n(II). As to THINGS GOOD OR BAD IN THEIR CONSEQUENCES, and by the\naptness that is in them to procure us good or evil in the future, we\njudge amiss several ways.\n1. When we judge that so much evil does not really depend on them as in\ntruth there does.\n2. When we judge that, though the consequence be of that moment, yet it\nis not of that certainty, but that it may otherwise fall out, or else\nby some means be avoided; as by industry, address, change, repentance,\n&c.\nThat these are wrong ways of judging, were easy to show in every\nparticular, if I would examine them at large singly: but I shall only\nmention this in general, viz. that it is a very wrong and irrational\nway of proceeding, to venture a greater good for a less, upon uncertain\nguesses; and before a due examination be made, proportionable to the\nweightiness of the matter, and the concernment it is to us not to\nmistake. This I think every one must confess, especially if he\nconsiders the usual cause of this wrong judgment, whereof these\nfollowing are some:\u2014\n69. Causes of this.\n(i) IGNORANCE: He that judges without informing himself to the utmost\nthat he is capable, cannot acquit himself of judging amiss.\n(ii) INADVERTENCY: When a man overlooks even that which he does know.\nThis is an affected and present ignorance, which misleads our judgments\nas much as the other. Judging is, as it were, balancing an account, and\ndetermining on which side the odds lie. If therefore either side be\nhuddled up in haste, and several of the sums that should have gone into\nthe reckoning be overlooked and left out, this precipitancy causes as\nwrong a judgment as if it were a perfect ignorance. That which most\ncommonly causes this is, the prevalency of some present pleasure or\npain, heightened by our feeble passionate nature, most strongly wrought\non by what is present. To check this precipitancy, our understanding\nand reason were given us, if we will make a right use of them, to\nsearch and see, and then judge thereupon. How much sloth and\nnegligence, heat and passion, the prevalency of fashion or acquired\nindispositions do severally contribute, on occasion, to these wrong\njudgments, I shall not here further inquire. I shall only add one other\nfalse judgment, which I think necessary to mention, because perhaps it\nis little taken notice of, though of great influence.\n70. Wrong judgment of what is necessary to our Happiness.\nAll men desire happiness, that is past doubt: but, as has been already\nobserved, when they are rid of pain, they are apt to take up with any\npleasure at hand, or that custom has endeared to them; to rest\nsatisfied in that; and so being happy, till some new desire, by making\nthem uneasy, disturbs that happiness, and shows them that they are not\nso, they look no further; nor is the will determined to any action in\npursuit of any other known or apparent good. For since we find that we\ncannot enjoy all sorts of good, but one excludes another; we do not fix\nour desires on every apparent greater good, unless it be judged to be\nnecessary to our happiness: if we think we can be happy without it, it\nmoves us not. This is another occasion to men of judging wrong; when\nthey take not that to be necessary to their happiness which really is\nso. This mistake misleads us, both in the choice of the good we aim at,\nand very often in the means to it, when it is a remote good. But, which\nway ever it be, either by placing it where really it is not, or by\nneglecting the means as not necessary to it;\u2014when a man misses his\ngreat end, happiness, he will acknowledge he judged not right. That\nwhich contributes to this mistake is the real or supposed\nunpleasantness of the actions which are the way to this end; it seeming\nso preposterous a thing to men, to make themselves unhappy in order to\nhappiness, that they do not easily bring themselves to it.\n71. We can change the Agreeableness or Disagreeableness in Things.\nThe last inquiry, therefore, concerning this matter is,\u2014Whether it be\nin a man\u2019s power to change the pleasantness and unpleasantness that\naccompanies any sort of action? And as to that, it is plain, in many\ncases he can. Men may and should correct their palates, and give relish\nto what either has, or they suppose has none. The relish of the mind is\nas various as that of the body, and like that too may be altered; and\nit is a mistake to think that men cannot change the displeasingness or\nindifferency that is in actions into pleasure and desire, if they will\ndo but what is in their power. A due consideration will do it in some\ncases; and practice, application, and custom in most. Bread or tobacco\nmay be neglected where they are shown to be useful to health, because\nof an indifferency or disrelish to them; reason and consideration at\nfirst recommends, and begins their trial, and use finds, or custom\nmakes them pleasant. That this is so in virtue too, is very certain.\nActions are pleasing or displeasing, either in themselves, or\nconsidered as a means to a greater and more desirable end. The eating\nof a well-seasoned dish, suited to a man\u2019s palate, may move the mind by\nthe delight itself that accompanies the eating, without reference to\nany other end; to which the consideration of the pleasure there is in\nhealth and strength (to which that meat is subservient) may add a new\nGUSTO, able to make us swallow an ill-relished potion. In the latter of\nthese, any action is rendered more or less pleasing, only by the\ncontemplation of the end, and the being more or less persuaded of its\ntendency to it, or necessary connexion with it: but the pleasure of the\naction itself is best acquired or increased by use and practice. Trials\noften reconcile us to that, which at a distance we looked on with\naversion; and by repetitions wear us into a liking of what possibly, in\nthe first essay, displeased us. Habits have powerful charms, and put so\nstrong attractions of easiness and pleasure into what we accustom\nourselves to, that we cannot forbear to do, or at least be easy in the\nomission of, actions, which habitual practice has suited, and thereby\nrecommends to us. Though this be very visible, and every one\u2019s\nexperience shows him he can do so; yet it is a part in the conduct of\nmen towards their happiness, neglected to a degree, that it will be\npossibly entertained as a paradox, if it be said, that men can MAKE\nthings or actions more or less pleasing to themselves; and thereby\nremedy that, to which one may justly impute a great deal of their\nwandering. Fashion and the common opinion having settled wrong notions,\nand education and custom ill habits, the just values of things are\nmisplaced, and the palates of men corrupted. Pains should be taken to\nrectify these; and contrary habits change our pleasures, and give a\nrelish to that which is necessary or conducive to our happiness. This\nevery one must confess he can do; and when happiness is lost, and\nmisery overtakes him, he will confess he did amiss in neglecting it,\nand condemn himself for it; and I ask every one, whether he has not\noften done so?\n72. Preference of Vice to Virtue a manifest wrong Judgment.\nI shall not now enlarge any further on the wrong judgments and neglect\nof what is in their power, whereby men mislead themselves. This would\nmake a volume, and is not my business. But whatever false notions, or\nshameful neglect of what is in their power, may put men out of their\nway to happiness, and distract them, as we see, into so different\ncourses of life, this yet is certain, that morality established upon\nits true foundations, cannot but determine the choice in any one that\nwill but consider: and he that will not be so far a rational creature\nas to reflect seriously upon INFINITE happiness and misery, must needs\ncondemn himself as not making that use of his understanding he should.\nThe rewards and punishments of another life which the Almighty has\nestablished, as the enforcements of his law, are of weight enough to\ndetermine the choice against whatever pleasure or pain this life can\nshow, where the eternal state is considered but in its bare possibility\nwhich nobody can make any doubt of. He that will allow exquisite and\nendless happiness to be but the possible consequence of a good life\nhere, and the contrary state the possible reward of a bad one, must own\nhimself to judge very much amiss if he does not conclude,\u2014That a\nvirtuous life, with the certain expectation of everlasting bliss, which\nmay come, is to be preferred to a vicious one, with the fear of that\ndreadful state of misery, which it is very possible may overtake the\nguilty; or, at best, the terrible uncertain hope of annihilation. This\nis evidently so, though the virtuous life here had nothing but pain,\nand the vicious continual pleasure: which yet is, for the most part,\nquite otherwise, and wicked men have not much the odds to brag of, even\nin their present possession; nay, all things rightly considered, have,\nI think, even the worse part here. But when infinite happiness is put\ninto one scale, against infinite misery in the other; if the worst that\ncomes to the pious man, if he mistakes, be the best that the wicked can\nattain to, if he be in the right, who can without madness run the\nventure? Who in his wits would choose to come within a possibility of\ninfinite misery; which if he miss, there is yet nothing to be got by\nthat hazard? Whereas, on the other side, the sober man ventures nothing\nagainst infinite happiness to be got, if his expectation comes not to\npass. If the good man be in the right, he is eternally happy; if he\nmistakes, he is not miserable, he feels nothing. On the other side, if\nthe wicked man be in the right, he is not happy; if he mistakes, he is\ninfinitely miserable. Must it not be a most manifest wrong judgment\nthat does not presently see to which side, in this case, the preference\nis to be given? I have forborne to mention anything of the certainty or\nprobability of a future state, designing here to show the wrong\njudgment that any one must allow he makes, upon his own principles,\nlaid how he pleases, who prefers the short pleasures of a vicious life\nupon any consideration, whilst he knows, and cannot but be certain,\nthat a future life is at least possible.\n73. Recapitulation\u2014Liberty of indifferency.\nTo conclude this inquiry into human liberty, which, as it stood before,\nI myself from the beginning fearing, and a very judicious friend of\nmine, since the publication, suspecting to have some mistake in it,\nthough he could not particularly show it me, I was put upon a stricter\nreview of this chapter. Wherein lighting upon a very easy and scarce\nobservable slip I had made, in putting one seemingly indifferent word\nfor another that discovery opened to me this present view, which here,\nin this second edition, I submit to the learned world, and which, in\nshort, is this: LIBERTY is a power to act or not to act, according as\nthe mind directs. A power to direct the operative faculties to motion\nor rest in particular instances is that which we call the WILL. That\nwhich in the train of our voluntary actions determines the will to any\nchange of operation is SOME PRESENT UNEASINESS, which is, or at least\nis always accompanied with that of DESIRE. Desire is always moved by\nevil, to fly it: because a total freedom from pain always makes a\nnecessary part of our happiness: but every good, nay, every greater\ngood, does not constantly move desire, because it may not make, or may\nnot be taken to make, any necessary part of our happiness. For all that\nwe desire, is only to be happy. But, though this general desire of\nhappiness operates constantly and invariably, yet the satisfaction of\nany particular desire CAN BE SUSPENDED from determining the will to any\nsubservient action, till we have maturely examined whether the\nparticular apparent good which we then desire makes a part of our real\nhappiness, or be consistent or inconsistent with it. The result of our\njudgment upon that examination is what ultimately determines the man;\nwho could not be FREE if his will were determined by anything but his\nown desire, guided by his own judgment.\n74. Active and passive power, in motions and in thinking.\nTrue notions concerning the nature and extent of LIBERTY are of so\ngreat importance, that I hope I shall be pardoned this digression,\nwhich my attempt to explain it has led me into. The ideas of will,\nvolition, liberty, and necessity, in this Chapter of Power, came\nnaturally in my way. In a former edition of this Treatise I gave an\naccount of my thoughts concerning them, according to the light I then\nhad. And now, as a lover of truth, and not a worshipper of my own\ndoctrines, I own some change of my opinion; which I think I have\ndiscovered ground for. In what I first writ, I with an unbiassed\nindifferency followed truth, whither I thought she led me. But neither\nbeing so vain as to fancy infallibility, nor so disingenuous as to\ndissemble my mistakes for fear of blemishing my reputation, I have,\nwith the same sincere design for truth only, not been ashamed to\npublish what a severer inquiry has suggested. It is not impossible but\nthat some may think my former notions right; and some (as I have\nalready found) these latter; and some neither. I shall not at all\nwonder at this variety in men\u2019s opinions: impartial deductions of\nreason in controverted points being so rare, and exact ones in abstract\nnotions not so very easy especially if of any length. And, therefore, I\nshould think myself not a little beholden to any one, who would, upon\nthese or any other grounds, fairly clear this subject of LIBERTY from\nany difficulties that may yet remain.\n75. Summary of our Original ideas.\nAnd thus I have, in a short draught, given a view of OUR ORIGINAL\nIDEAS, from whence all the rest are derived, and of which they are made\nup; which, if I would consider as a philosopher, and examine on what\ncauses they depend, and of what they are made, I believe they all might\nbe reduced to these very few primary and original ones, viz. EXTENSION,\nSOLIDITY, MOBILITY, or the power of being moved; which by our senses we\nreceive from body: PERCEPTIVITY, or the power of perception, or\nthinking; MOTIVITY, or the power of moving: which by reflection we\nreceive from OUR MINDS.\nI crave leave to make use of these two new words, to avoid the danger\nof being mistaken in the use of those which are equivocal.\nTo which if we add EXISTENCE, DURATION, NUMBER, which belong both to\nthe one and the other, we have, perhaps, all the original ideas on\nwhich the rest depend. For by these, I imagine, might be EXPLAINED the\nnature of colours, sounds, tastes, smells, and ALL OTHER IDEAS WE HAVE,\nif we had but faculties acute enough to perceive the severally modified\nextensions and motions of these minute bodies, which produce those\nseveral sensations in us. But my present purpose being only to inquire\ninto the knowledge the mind has of things, by those ideas and\nappearances which God has fitted it to receive from them, and how the\nmind comes by that knowledge; rather than into their causes or manner\nof Production, I shall not, contrary to the design of this Essay, see\nmyself to inquire philosophically into the peculiar constitution of\nBODIES, and the configuration of parts, whereby THEY have the power to\nproduce in us the ideas of their sensible qualities. I shall not enter\nany further into that disquisition; it sufficing to my purpose to\nobserve, that gold or saffron has power to produce in us the idea of\nyellow, and snow or milk the idea of white, which we can only have by\nour sight without examining the texture of the parts of those bodies or\nthe particular figures or motion of the particles which rebound from\nthem, to cause in us that particular sensation, though, when we go\nbeyond the bare ideas in our minds and would inquire into their causes,\nwe cannot conceive anything else to be in any sensible object, whereby\nit produces different ideas in us, but the different bulk, figure,\nnumber, texture, and motion of its insensible parts.\nCHAPTER XXII.\nOF MIXED MODES.\n1. Mixed Modes, what.\nHaving treated of SIMPLE MODES in the foregoing chapters, and given\nseveral instances of some of the most considerable of them, to show\nwhat they are, and how we come by them; we are now in the next place to\nconsider those we call MIXED MODES; such are the complex ideas we mark\nby the names OBLIGATION, DRUNKENNESS, a LIE, &c.; which consisting of\nseveral combinations of simple ideas of DIFFERENT kinds, I have called\nmixed modes, to distinguish them from the more simple modes, which\nconsist only of simple ideas of the SAME kind. These mixed modes, being\nalso such combinations of simple ideas as are not looked upon to be\ncharacteristical marks of any real beings that have a steady existence,\nbut scattered and independent ideas put together by the mind, are\nthereby distinguished from the complex ideas of substances.\n2. Made by the Mind.\nThat the mind, in respect of its simple ideas, is wholly passive, and\nreceives them all from the existence and operations of things, such as\nsensation or reflection offers them, without being able to MAKE any one\nidea, experience shows us. But if we attentively consider these ideas I\ncall mixed modes, we are now speaking of, we shall find their origin\nquite different. The mind often exercises an ACTIVE power in making\nthese several combinations. For, it being once furnished with simple\nideas, it can put them together in several compositions, and so make\nvariety of complex ideas, without examining whether they exist so\ntogether in nature. And hence I think it is that these ideas are called\nNOTIONS: as they had their original, and constant existence, more in\nthe thoughts of men, than in the reality of things; and to form such\nideas, it sufficed that the mind put the parts of them together, and\nthat they were consistent in the understanding without considering\nwhether they had any real being: though I do not deny but several of\nthem might be taken from observation, and the existence of several\nsimple ideas so combined, as they are put together in the\nunderstanding. For the man who first framed the idea of HYPOCRISY,\nmight have either taken it at first from the observation of one who\nmade show of good qualities which he had not; or else have framed that\nidea in his mind without having any such pattern to fashion it by. For\nit is evident that, in the beginning of languages and societies of men,\nseveral of those complex ideas, which were consequent to the\nconstitutions established amongst them, must needs have been in the\nminds of men before they existed anywhere else; and that many names\nthat stood for such complex ideas were in use, and so those ideas\nframed, before the combinations they stood for ever existed.\n3. Sometimes got by the Explication of their Names.\nIndeed, now that languages are made, and abound with words standing for\nsuch combinations, an usual way of GETTING these complex ideas is, by\nthe explication of those terms that stand for them. For, consisting of\na company of simple ideas combined, they may, by words standing for\nthose simple ideas, be represented to the mind of one who understands\nthose words, though that complex combination of simple ideas were never\noffered to his mind by the real existence of things. Thus a man may\ncome to have the idea of SACRILEGE or MURDER, by enumerating to him the\nsimple ideas which these words stand for; without ever seeing either of\nthem committed.\n4. The Name ties the Parts of mixed Modes into one Idea.\nEvery mixed mode consisting of many distinct simple ideas, it seems\nreasonable to inquire, Whence it has its unity; and how such a precise\nmultitude comes to make but one idea; since that combination does not\nalways exist together in nature? To which I answer, it is plain it has\nits unity from an act of the mind, combining those several simple ideas\ntogether, and considering them as one complex one, consisting of those\nparts; and the mark of this union, or that which is looked on generally\nto complete it, is one NAME given to that combination. For it is by\ntheir names that men commonly regulate their account of their distinct\nspecies of mixed modes, seldom allowing or considering any number of\nsimple ideas to make one complex one, but such collections as there be\nnames for. Thus, though the killing of an old man be as fit in nature\nto be united into one complex idea, as the killing a man\u2019s father; yet,\nthere being no name standing precisely for the one, as there is the\nname of PARRICIDE to mark the other, it is not taken for a particular\ncomplex idea, nor a distinct species of actions from that of killing a\nyoung man, or any other man.\n5. The Cause of making mixed Modes.\nIf we should inquire a little further, to see what it is that occasions\nmen to make several combinations of simple ideas into distinct, and, as\nit were, settled modes, and neglect others, which in the nature of\nthings themselves, have as much an aptness to be combined and make\ndistinct ideas, we shall find the reason of it to be the end of\nlanguage; which being to mark, or communicate men\u2019s thoughts to one\nanother with all the dispatch that may be, they usually make SUCH\ncollections of ideas into complex modes, and affix names to them, as\nthey have frequent use of in their way of living and conversation,\nleaving others which they have but seldom an occasion to mention, loose\nand without names that tie them together: they rather choosing to\nenumerate (when they have need) such ideas as make them up, by the\nparticular names that stand for them, than to trouble their memories by\nmultiplying of complex ideas with names to them, which they seldom or\nnever have any occasion to make use of.\n6. Why Words in one Language have none answering in another.\nThis shows us how it comes to pass that there are in every language\nmany particular words which cannot be rendered by any one single word\nof another. For the several fashions, customs, and manners of one\nnation, making several combinations of ideas familiar and necessary in\none, which another people have had never an occasion to make, or\nperhaps so much as take notice of, names come of course to be annexed\nto them, to avoid long periphrases in things of daily conversation; and\nso they become so many distinct complex ideas in their minds. Thus\nostrakismos amongst the Greeks, and proscriptio amongst the Romans,\nwere words which other languages had no names that exactly answered;\nbecause they stood for complex ideas which were not in the minds of the\nmen of other nations. Where there was no such custom, there was no\nnotion of any such actions; no use of such combinations of ideas as\nwere united, and, as it were, tied together, by those terms: and\ntherefore in other countries there were no names for them.\n7. And Languages change.\nHence also we may see the reason, why languages constantly change, take\nup new and lay by old terms. Because change of customs and opinions\nbringing with it new combinations of ideas, which it is necessary\nfrequently to think on and talk about, new names, to avoid long\ndescriptions, are annexed to them; and so they become new species of\ncomplex modes. What a number of different ideas are by this means\nwrapped up in one short sound, and how much of our time and breath is\nthereby saved, any one will see, who will but take the pains to\nenumerate all the ideas that either REPRIEVE or APPEAL stand for; and\ninstead of either of those names, use a periphrasis, to make any one\nunderstand their meaning.\n8. Mixed Modes\nThough I shall have occasion to consider this more at-large when I come\nto treat of Words and their use, yet I could not avoid to take thus\nmuch notice here of the NAMES OF MIXED MODES; which being fleeting and\ntransient combinations of simple ideas, which have but a short\nexistence anywhere but in the minds of men, and there too have no\nlonger any existence than whilst they are thought on, have not so much\nanywhere the appearance of a constant and lasting existence as in their\nnames: which are therefore, in this sort of ideas, very apt to be taken\nfor the ideas themselves. For, if we should inquire where the idea of a\nTRIUMPH or APOTHEOSIS exists, it is evident they could neither of them\nexist altogether anywhere in the things themselves, being actions that\nrequired time to their performance, and so could never all exist\ntogether; and as to the minds of men, where the ideas of these actions\nare supposed to be lodged, they have there too a very uncertain\nexistence: and therefore we are apt to annex them to the names that\nexcite them in us.\n9. How we get the Ideas of mixed Modes.\nThere are therefore three ways whereby we get these complex ideas of\nmixed modes:\u2014(1) By experience and OBSERVATION of things themselves:\nthus, by seeing two men mixed wrestle or fence, we get the idea of\nwrestling or fencing. (2) By INVENTION, or voluntary putting together\nof several simple ideas in our own minds: so he that first invented\nprinting or etching, had an idea of it in his mind before it ever\nexisted. (3) Which is the most usual way, by EXPLAINING THE NAMES of\nactions we never saw, or motions we cannot see; and by enumerating, and\nthereby, as it were, setting before our imaginations all those ideas\nwhich go to the making them up, and are the constituent parts of them.\nFor, having by sensation and reflection stored our minds with simple\nideas, and by use got the names that stand for them, we can by those\nmeans represent to another any complex idea we would have him conceive;\nso that it has in it no simple ideas but what he knows, and has with us\nthe same name for. For all our complex ideas are ultimately resolvable\ninto simple ideas, of which they are compounded and originally made up,\nthough perhaps their immediate ingredients, as I may so say, are also\ncomplex ideas. Thus, the mixed mode which the word LIE stands for is\nmade of these simple ideas:\u2014(1) Articulate sounds. (2) Certain ideas in\nthe mind of the speaker. (3) Those words the signs of those ideas. (4)\nThose signs put together, by affirmation or negation, otherwise than\nthe ideas they stand for are in the mind of the speaker. I think I need\nnot go any further in the analysis of that complex idea we call a lie:\nwhat I have said is enough to show that it is made up of simple ideas.\nAnd it could not be but an offensive tediousness to my reader, to\ntrouble him with a more minute enumeration of every particular simple\nidea that goes to this complex one; which, from what has been said, he\ncannot but be able to make out to himself. The same may be done in all\nour complex ideas whatsoever; which, however compounded and\ndecompounded, may at last be resolved into simple ideas, which are all\nthe materials of knowledge or thought we have, or can have. Nor shall\nwe have reason to fear that the mind is hereby stinted to too scanty a\nnumber of ideas, if we consider what an inexhaustible stock of simple\nmodes number and figure alone afford us. How far then mixed modes,\nwhich admit of the various combinations of different simple ideas, and\ntheir infinite modes, are from being few and scanty, we may easily\nimagine. So that, before we have done, we shall see that nobody need be\nafraid he shall not have scope and compass enough for his thoughts to\nrange in, though they be, as I pretend, confined only to simple ideas,\nreceived from sensation or reflection, and their several combinations.\n10. Motion, Thinking, and Power have been most modified.\nIt is worth our observing, which of all our simple ideas have been MOST\nmodified, and had most mixed ideas made out of them, with names given\nto them. And those have been these three:\u2014THINKING and MOTION (which\nare the two ideas which comprehend in them all action,) and POWER, from\nwhence these actions are conceived to flow. These simple ideas, I say,\nof thinking, motion, and power, have been those which have been most\nmodified; and out of whose modifications have been made most complex\nmodes, with names to them. For ACTION being the great business of\nmankind, and the whole matter about which all laws are conversant, it\nis no wonder that the several modes of thinking and motion should be\ntaken notice of, the ideas of them observed, and laid up in the memory,\nand have names assigned to them; without which laws could be but ill\nmade, or vice and disorders repressed. Nor could any communication be\nwell had amongst men without such complex ideas, with names to them:\nand therefore men have settled names, and supposed settled ideas in\ntheir minds, of modes of actions, distinguished by their causes, means,\nobjects, ends, instruments, time, place, and other circumstances; and\nalso of their powers fitted for those actions: v.g. BOLDNESS is the\npower to speak or do what we intend, before others, without fear or\ndisorder; and the Greeks call the confidence of speaking by a peculiar\nname, [word in Greek]: which power or ability in man of doing anything,\nwhen it has been acquired by frequent doing the same thing, is that\nidea we name HABIT; when it is forward, and ready upon every occasion\nto break into action, we call it DISPOSITION. Thus, TESTINESS is a\ndisposition or aptness to be angry.\nTo conclude: Let us examine any modes of action, v.g. CONSIDERATION and\nASSENT, which are actions of the mind; RUNNING and SPEAKING, which are\nactions of the body; REVENGE and MURDER, which are actions of both\ntogether, and we shall find them but so many collections of simple\nideas, which, together, make up the complex ones signified by those\nnames.\n11. Several Words seeming to signify Action, signify but the effect.\nPOWER being the source from whence all action proceeds, the substances\nwherein these powers are, when they *[lost line??] exert this power\ninto act, are called CAUSES, and the substances which thereupon are\nproduced, or the simple ideas which are introduced into any subject by\nthe exerting of that power, are called EFFECTS. The EFFICACY whereby\nthe new substance or idea is produced is called, in the subject\nexerting that power, ACTION; but in the subject wherein any simple idea\nis changed or produced, it is called PASSION: which efficacy, however\nvarious, and the effects almost infinite, yet we can, I think, conceive\nit, in intellectual agents, to be nothing else but modes of thinking\nand willing; in corporeal agents, nothing else but modifications of\nmotion. I say I think we cannot conceive it to be any other but these\ntwo. For whatever sort of action besides these produces any effects, I\nconfess myself to have no notion nor idea of; and so it is quite remote\nfrom my thoughts, apprehensions, and knowledge; and as much in the dark\nto me as five other senses, or as the ideas of colours to a blind man.\nAnd therefore many words which seem to express some action, signify\nnothing of the action or MODUS OPERANDI at all, but barely the effect,\nwith some circumstances of the subject wrought on, or cause operating:\nv.g. CREATION, ANNIHILATION, contain in them no idea of the action or\nmanner whereby they are produced, but barely of the cause, and the\nthing done. And when a countryman says the cold freezes water, though\nthe word freezing seems to import some action, yet truly it signifies\nnothing but the effect, viz. that water that was before fluid is become\nhard and consistent, without containing any idea of the action whereby\nit is done.\n12. Mixed Modes made also of other Ideas than those of Power and\nAction.\nI think I shall not need to remark here that, though power and action\nmake the greatest part of mixed modes, marked by names, and familiar in\nthe minds and mouths of men, yet other simple ideas, and their several\ncombinations, are not excluded: much less, I think, will it be\nnecessary for me to enumerate all the mixed modes which have been\nsettled, with names to them. That would be to make a dictionary of the\ngreatest part of the words made use of in divinity, ethics, law, and\npolitics, and several other sciences. All that is requisite to my\npresent design, is to show what sort of ideas those are which I call\nmixed modes; how the mind comes by them; and that they are compositions\nmade up of simple ideas got from sensation and reflection; which I\nsuppose I have done.\nCHAPTER XXIII.\nOF OUR COMPLEX IDEAS OF SUBSTANCES.\nThe mind being, as I have declared, furnished with a great number of\nthe simple ideas, conveyed in by the senses as they are found in\nexterior things, or by reflection on its own operations, takes notice\nalso that a certain number of these simple ideas go constantly\ntogether; which being presumed to belong to one thing, and words being\nsuited to common apprehensions, and made use of for quick dispatch are\ncalled, so united in one subject, by one name; which, by inadvertency,\nwe are apt afterward to talk of and consider as one simple idea, which\nindeed is a complication of many ideas together: because, as I have\nsaid, not imagining how these simple ideas CAN subsist by themselves,\nwe accustom ourselves to suppose some SUBSTRATUM wherein they do\nsubsist, and from which they do result, which therefore we call\nSUBSTANCE.\n2. Our obscure Idea of Substance in general.\nSo that if any one will examine himself concerning his notion of pure\nsubstance in general, he will find he has no other idea of it at all,\nbut only a supposition of he knows not what SUPPORT of such qualities\nwhich are capable of producing simple ideas in us; which qualities are\ncommonly called accidents. If any one should be asked, what is the\nsubject wherein colour or weight inheres, he would have nothing to say,\nbut the solid extended parts; and if he were demanded, what is it that\nsolidity and extension adhere in, he would not be in a much better case\nthan the Indian before mentioned who, saying that the world was\nsupported by a great elephant, was asked what the elephant rested on;\nto which his answer was\u2014a great tortoise: but being again pressed to\nknow what gave support to the broad-backed tortoise, replied\u2014SOMETHING,\nHE KNEW NOT WHAT. And thus here, as in all other cases where we use\nwords without having clear and distinct ideas, we talk like children:\nwho, being questioned what such a thing is, which they know not,\nreadily give this satisfactory answer, that it is SOMETHING: which in\ntruth signifies no more, when so used, either by children or men, but\nthat they know not what; and that the thing they pretend to know, and\ntalk of, is what they have no distinct idea of at all, and so are\nperfectly ignorant of it, and in the dark. The idea then we have, to\nwhich we give the GENERAL name substance, being nothing but the\nsupposed, but unknown, support of those qualities we find existing,\nwhich we imagine cannot subsist SINE RE SUBSTANTE, without something to\nsupport them, we call that support SUBSTANTIA; which, according to the\ntrue import of the word, is, in plain English, standing under or\nupholding.\n3. Of the Sorts of Substances.\nAn obscure and relative idea of SUBSTANCE IN GENERAL being thus made we\ncome to have the ideas of PARTICULAR SORTS OF SUBSTANCES, by collecting\nSUCH combinations of simple ideas as are, by experience and observation\nof men\u2019s senses, taken notice of to exist together; and are therefore\nsupposed to flow from the particular internal constitution, or unknown\nessence of that substance. Thus we come to have the ideas of a man,\nhorse, gold, water, &c.; of which substances, whether any one has any\nother CLEAR idea, further than of certain simple ideas co-existent\ntogether, I appeal to every one\u2019s own experience. It is the ordinary\nqualities observable in iron, or a diamond, put together, that make the\ntrue complex idea of those substances, which a smith or a jeweller\ncommonly knows better than a philosopher; who, whatever SUBSTANTIAL\nFORMS he may talk of, has no other idea of those substances, than what\nis framed by a collection of those simple ideas which are to be found\nin them: only we must take notice, that our complex ideas of\nsubstances, besides all those simple ideas they are made up of, have\nalways the confused idea of something to which they belong, and in\nwhich they subsist: and therefore when we speak of any sort of\nsubstance, we say it is a thing having such or such qualities; as body\nis a thing that is extended, figured, and capable of motion; spirit, a\nthing capable of thinking; and so hardness, friability, and power to\ndraw iron, we say, are qualities to be found in a loadstone. These, and\nthe like fashions of speaking, intimate that the substance is supposed\nalways SOMETHING BESIDES the extension, figure, solidity, motion,\nthinking, or other observable ideas, though we know not what it is.\n4. No clear or distinct idea of Substance in general.\nHence, when we talk or think of any particular sort of corporeal\nsubstances, as horse, stone, &c., though the idea we have of either of\nthem be but the complication or collection of those several simple\nideas of sensible qualities, which we used to find united in the thing\ncalled horse or stone; yet, BECAUSE WE CANNOT CONCEIVE HOW THEY SHOULD\nSUBSIST ALONE, NOR ONE IN ANOTHER, we suppose them existing in and\nsupported by some common subject; which support we denote by the name\nsubstance, though it be certain we have no clear or distinct idea of\nthat thing we suppose a support.\n5. As clear an Idea of spiritual substance as of corporeal substance.\nThe same happens concerning the operations of the mind, viz. thinking,\nreasoning, fearing, &c., which we concluding not to subsist of\nthemselves, nor apprehending how they can belong to body, or be\nproduced by it, we are apt to think these the actions of some other\nSUBSTANCE, which we call SPIRIT; whereby yet it is evident that, having\nno other idea or notion of matter, but something wherein those many\nsensible qualities which affect our senses do subsist; by supposing a\nsubstance wherein thinking, knowing, doubting, and a power of moving,\n&c., do subsist, we have as clear a notion of the substance of spirit,\nas we have of body; the one being supposed to be (without knowing what\nit is) the SUBSTRATUM to those simple ideas we have from without; and\nthe other supposed (with a like ignorance of what it is) to be the\nSUBSTRATUM to those operations we experiment in ourselves within. It is\nplain then, that the idea of CORPOREAL SUBSTANCE in matter is as remote\nfrom our conceptions and apprehensions, as that of SPIRITUAL SUBSTANCE,\nor spirit: and therefore, from our not having any notion of the\nsubstance of spirit, we can no more conclude its non-existence, than we\ncan, for the same reason, deny the existence of body; it being as\nrational to affirm there is no body, because we have no clear and\ndistinct idea of the substance of matter, as to say there is no spirit,\nbecause we have no clear and distinct idea of the substance of a\nspirit.\n6. Our ideas of particular Sorts of Substances.\nWhatever therefore be the secret abstract nature of substance in\ngeneral, all the ideas we have of particular distinct sorts of\nsubstances are nothing but several combinations of simple ideas,\nco-existing in such, though unknown, cause of their union, as makes the\nwhole subsist of itself. It is by such combinations of simple ideas,\nand nothing else, that we represent particular sorts of substances to\nourselves; such are the ideas we have of their several species in our\nminds; and such only do we, by their specific names, signify to others,\nv.g. man, horse, sun, water, iron: upon hearing which words, every one\nwho understands the language, frames in his mind a combination of those\nseveral simple ideas which he has usually observed, or fancied to exist\ntogether under that denomination; all which he supposes to rest in and\nbe, as it were, adherent to that unknown common subject, which inheres\nnot in anything else. Though, in the meantime, it be manifest, and\nevery one, upon inquiry into his own thoughts, will find, that he has\nno other idea of any substance, v.g. let it be gold, horse, iron, man,\nvitriol, bread, but what he has barely of those sensible qualities,\nwhich he supposes to inhere; with a supposition of such a substratum as\ngives, as it were, a support to those qualities or simple ideas, which\nhe has observed to exist united together. Thus, the idea of the\nsun,\u2014what is it but an aggregate of those several simple ideas, bright,\nhot, roundish, having a constant regular motion, at a certain distance\nfrom us, and perhaps some other: as he who thinks and discourses of the\nsun has been more or less accurate in observing those sensible\nqualities, ideas, or properties, which are in that thing which he calls\nthe sun.\n7. Their active and passive Powers a great part of our complex Ideas of\nSubstances.\nFor he has the perfectest idea of any of the particular sorts of\nsubstances, who has gathered, and put together, most of those simple\nideas which do exist in it; among which are to be reckoned its active\npowers, and passive capacities, which, though not simple ideas, yet in\nthis respect, for brevity\u2019s sake, may conveniently enough be reckoned\namongst them. Thus, the power of drawing iron is one of the ideas of\nthe complex one of that substance we call a loadstone; and a power to\nbe so drawn is a part of the complex one we call iron: which powers\npass for inherent qualities in those subjects. Because every substance,\nbeing as apt, by the powers we observe in it, to change some sensible\nqualities in other subjects, as it is to produce in us those simple\nideas which we receive immediately from it, does, by those new sensible\nqualities introduced into other subjects, discover to us those powers\nwhich do thereby mediately affect our senses, as regularly as its\nsensible qualities do it immediately: v. g. we immediately by our\nsenses perceive in fire its heat and colour; which are, if rightly\nconsidered, nothing but powers in it to produce those ideas in US: we\nalso by our senses perceive the colour and brittleness of charcoal,\nwhereby we come by the knowledge of another power in fire, which it has\nto change the colour and consistency of WOOD. By the former, fire\nimmediately, by the latter, it mediately discovers to us these several\npowers; which therefore we look upon to be a part of the qualities of\nfire, and so make them a part of the complex idea of it. For all those\npowers that we take cognizance of, terminating only in the alteration\nof some sensible qualities in those subjects on which they operate, and\nso making them exhibit to us new sensible ideas, therefore it is that I\nhave reckoned these powers amongst the simple ideas which make the\ncomplex ones of the sorts of substances; though these powers considered\nin themselves, are truly complex ideas. And in this looser sense I\ncrave leave to be understood, when I name any of these POTENTIALITIES\namong the simple ideas which we recollect in our minds when we think of\nPARTICULAR SUBSTANCES. For the powers that are severally in them are\nnecessary to be considered, if we will have true distinct notions of\nthe several sorts of substances.\n8. And why.\nNor are we to wonder that powers make a great part of our complex ideas\nof substances; since their secondary qualities are those which in most\nof them serve principally to distinguish substances one from another,\nand commonly make a considerable part of the complex idea of the\nseveral sorts of them. For, our senses failing us in the discovery of\nthe bulk, texture, and figure of the minute parts of bodies, on which\ntheir real constitutions and differences depend, we are fain to make\nuse of their secondary qualities as the characteristical notes and\nmarks whereby to frame ideas of them in our minds, and distinguish them\none from another: all which secondary qualities, as has been shown, are\nnothing but bare powers. For the colour and taste of opium are, as well\nas its soporific or anodyne virtues, mere powers, depending on its\nprimary qualities, whereby it is fitted to produce different operations\non different parts of our bodies.\n9. Three sorts of Ideas make our complex ones of Corporeal Substances.\nThe ideas that make our complex ones of corporeal substances, are of\nthese three sorts. First, the ideas of the primary qualities of things,\nwhich are discovered by our senses, and are in them even when we\nperceive them not; such are the bulk, figure, number, situation, and\nmotion of the parts of bodies; which are really in them, whether we\ntake notice of them or not. Secondly, the sensible secondary qualities,\nwhich, depending on these, are nothing but the powers those substances\nhave to produce several ideas in us by our senses; which ideas are not\nin the things themselves, otherwise than as anything is in its cause.\nThirdly, the aptness we consider in any substance, to give or receive\nsuch alterations of primary qualities, as that the substance so altered\nshould produce in us different ideas from what it did before; these are\ncalled active and passive powers: all which powers, as far as we have\nany notice or notion of them, terminate only in sensible simple ideas.\nFor whatever alteration a loadstone has the power to make in the minute\nparticles of iron, we should have no notion of any power it had at all\nto operate on iron, did not its sensible motion discover it: and I\ndoubt not, but there are a thousand changes, that bodies we daily\nhandle have a power to cause in one another, which we never suspect,\nbecause they never appear in sensible effects.\n10. Powers thus make a great Part of our complex Ideas of particular\nSubstances.\nPOWERS therefore justly make a great part of our complex ideas of\nsubstances. He that will examine his complex idea of gold, will find\nseveral of its ideas that make it up to be only powers; as the power of\nbeing melted, but of not spending itself in the fire; of being\ndissolved in AQUA REGIA, are ideas as necessary to make up our complex\nidea of gold, as its colour and weight: which, if duly considered, are\nalso nothing but different powers. For, to speak truly, yellowness is\nnot actually in gold, but is a power in gold to produce that idea in us\nby our eyes, when placed in a due light: and the heat, which we cannot\nleave out of our ideas of the sun, is no more really in the sun, than\nthe white colour it introduces into wax. These are both equally powers\nin the sun, operating, by the motion and figure of its sensible parts,\nso on a man, as to make him have the idea of heat; and so on wax, as to\nmake it capable to produce in a man the idea of white.\n11. The now secondary Qualities of Bodies would disappear, if we could\ndiscover the primary ones of their minute Parts.\nHad we senses acute enough to discern the minute particles of bodies,\nand the real constitution on which their sensible qualities depend, I\ndoubt not but they would produce quite different ideas in us: and that\nwhich is now the yellow colour of gold, would then disappear, and\ninstead of it we should see an admirable texture of parts, of a certain\nsize and figure. This microscopes plainly discover to us; for what to\nour naked eyes produces a certain colour, is, by thus augmenting the\nacuteness of our senses, discovered to be quite a different thing; and\nthe thus altering, as it were, the proportion of the bulk of the minute\nparts of a coloured object to our usual sight, produces different ideas\nfrom what it did before. Thus, sand or pounded glass, which is opaque,\nand white to the naked eye, is pellucid in a microscope; and a hair\nseen in this way, loses its former colour, and is, in a great measure,\npellucid, with a mixture of some bright sparkling colours, such as\nappear from the refraction of diamonds, and other pellucid bodies.\nBlood, to the naked eye, appears all red; but by a good microscope,\nwherein its lesser parts appear, shows only some few globules of red,\nswimming in a pellucid liquor, and how these red globules would appear,\nif glasses could be found that could yet magnify them a thousand or ten\nthousand times more, is uncertain.\n12. Our Faculties for Discovery of the Qualities and powers of\nSubstances suited to our State.\nThe infinite wise Contriver of us, and all things about us, hath fitted\nour senses, faculties, and organs, to the conveniences of life, and the\nbusiness we have to do here. We are able, by our senses, to know and\ndistinguish things: and to examine them so far as to apply them to our\nuses, and several ways to accommodate the exigences of this life. We\nhave insight enough into their admirable contrivances and wonderful\neffects, to admire and magnify the wisdom, power and goodness of their\nAuthor. Such a knowledge as this which is suited to our present\ncondition, we want not faculties to attain. But it appears not that God\nintended we should have a perfect, clear, and adequate knowledge of\nthem: that perhaps is not in the comprehension of any finite being. We\nare furnished with faculties (dull and weak as they are) to discover\nenough in the creatures to lead us to the knowledge of the Creator, and\nthe knowledge of our duty; and we are fitted well enough with abilities\nto provide for the conveniences of living: these are our business in\nthis world. But were our senses altered, and made much quicker and\nacuter, the appearance and outward scheme of things would have quite\nanother face to us; and, I am apt to think, would be inconsistent with\nour being, or at least wellbeing, in the part of the universe which we\ninhabit. He that considers how little our constitution is able to bear\na remove into part of this air, not much higher than that we commonly\nbreathe in, will have reason to be satisfied, that in this globe of\nearth allotted for our mansion, the all-wise Architect has suited our\norgans, and the bodies that are to affect them, one to another. If our\nsense of hearing were but a thousand times quicker than it is, how\nwould a perpetual noise distract us. And we should in the quietest\nretirement be less able to sleep or meditate than in the middle of a\nsea-fight. Nay, if that most instructive of our senses, seeing, were in\nany man a thousand or a hundred thousand times more acute than it is by\nthe best microscope, things several millions of times less than the\nsmallest object of his sight now would then be visible to his naked\neyes, and so he would come nearer to the discovery of the texture and\nmotion of the minute parts of corporeal things; and in many of them,\nprobably get ideas of their internal constitutions: but then he would\nbe in a quite different world from other people: nothing would appear\nthe same to him and others: the visible ideas of everything would be\ndifferent. So that I doubt, whether he and the rest of men could\ndiscourse concerning the objects of sight, or have any communication\nabout colours, their appearances being so wholly different. And perhaps\nsuch a quickness and tenderness of sight could not endure bright\nsunshine, or so much as open daylight; nor take in but a very small\npart of any object at once, and that too only at a very near distance.\nAnd if by the help of such MICROSCOPICAL EYES (if I may so call them) a\nman could penetrate further than ordinary into the secret composition\nand radical texture of bodies, he would not make any great advantage by\nthe change, if such an acute sight would not serve to conduct him to\nthe market and exchange; if he could not see things he was to avoid, at\na convenient distance; nor distinguish things he had to do with by\nthose sensible qualities others do. He that was sharp-sighted enough to\nsee the configuration of the minute particles of the spring of a clock,\nand observe upon what peculiar structure and impulse its elastic motion\ndepends, would no doubt discover something very admirable: but if eyes\nso framed could not view at once the hand, and the characters of the\nhour-plate, and thereby at a distance see what o\u2019clock it was, their\nowner could not be much benefited by that acuteness; which, whilst it\ndiscovered the secret contrivance of the parts of the machine, made him\nlose its use.\n13. Conjecture about the corporeal organs of some Spirits.\nAnd here give me leave to propose an extravagant conjecture of mine,\nviz. That since we have some reason (if there be any credit to be given\nto the report of things that our philosophy cannot account for) to\nimagine, that Spirits can assume to themselves bodies of different\nbulk, figure, and conformation of parts\u2014whether one great advantage\nsome of them have over us may not lie in this, that they can so frame\nand shape to themselves organs of sensation or perception, as to suit\nthem to their present design, and the circumstances of the object they\nwould consider. For how much would that man exceed all others in\nknowledge, who had but the faculty so to alter the structure of his\neyes, that one sense, as to make it capable of all the several degrees\nof vision which the assistance of glasses (casually at first lighted\non) has taught us to conceive? What wonders would he discover, who\ncould so fit his eyes to all sorts of objects, as to see when he\npleased the figure and motion of the minute particles in the blood, and\nother juices of animals, as distinctly as he does, at other times, the\nshape and motion of the animals themselves? But to us, in our present\nstate, unalterable organs, so contrived as to discover the figure and\nmotion of the minute parts of bodies, whereon depend those sensible\nqualities we now observe in them, would perhaps be of no advantage. God\nhas no doubt made them so as is best for us in our present condition.\nHe hath fitted us for the neighbourhood of the bodies that surround us,\nand we have to do with; and though we cannot, by the faculties we have,\nattain to a perfect knowledge of things, yet they will serve us well\nenough for those ends above-mentioned, which are our great concernment.\nI beg my reader\u2019s pardon for laying before him so wild a fancy\nconcerning the ways of perception of beings above us; but how\nextravagant soever it be, I doubt whether we can imagine anything about\nthe knowledge of angels but after this manner, some way or other in\nproportion to what we find and observe in ourselves. And though we\ncannot but allow that the infinite power and wisdom of God may frame\ncreatures with a thousand other faculties and ways of perceiving things\nwithout them than what we have, yet our thoughts can go no further than\nour own: so impossible it is for us to enlarge our very guesses beyond\nthe ideas received from our own sensation and reflection. The\nsupposition, at least, that angels do sometimes assume bodies, needs\nnot startle us; since some of the most ancient and most learned Fathers\nof the church seemed to believe that they had bodies: and this is\ncertain, that their state and way of existence is unknown to us.\n14. Our specific Ideas of Substances.\nBut to return to the matter in hand,\u2014the ideas we have of substances,\nand the ways we come by them. I say, our SPECIFIC ideas of substances\nare nothing else but A COLLECTION OF CERTAIN NUMBER OF SIMPLE IDEAS,\nCONSIDERED AS UNITED IN ONE THING. These ideas of substances, though\nthey are commonly simple apprehensions, and the names of them simple\nterms, yet in effect are complex and compounded. Thus the idea which an\nEnglishman signifies by the name swan, is white colour, long neck, red\nbeak, black legs, and whole feet, and all these of a certain size, with\na power of swimming in the water, and making a certain kind of noise,\nand perhaps, to a man who has long observed this kind of birds, some\nother properties: which all terminate in sensible simple ideas, all\nunited in one common subject.\n15. Our Ideas of spiritual Substances, as clear as of bodily\nSubstances.\nBesides the complex ideas we have of material sensible substances, of\nwhich I have last spoken,\u2014by the simple ideas we have taken from those\noperations of our own minds, which we experiment daily in ourselves, as\nthinking, understanding, willing, knowing, and power of beginning\nmotion, &c., co-existing in some substance, we are able to frame the\nCOMPLEX IDEA OF AN IMMATERIAL SPIRIT. And thus, by putting together the\nideas of thinking, perceiving, liberty, and power of moving themselves\nand other things, we have as clear a perception and notion of\nimmaterial substances as we have of material. For putting together the\nideas of thinking and willing, or the power of moving or quieting\ncorporeal motion, joined to substance, of which we have no distinct\nidea, we have the idea of an immaterial spirit; and by putting together\nthe ideas of coherent solid parts, and a power of being moved joined\nwith substance, of which likewise we have no positive idea, we have the\nidea of matter. The one is as clear and distinct an idea as the other:\nthe idea of thinking, and moving a body, being as clear and distinct\nideas as the ideas of extension, solidity, and being moved. For our\nidea of substance is equally obscure, or none at all, in both: it is\nbut a supposed I know not what, to support those ideas we call\naccidents. It is for want of reflection that we are apt to think that\nour senses show us nothing but material things. Every act of sensation,\nwhen duly considered, gives us an equal view of both parts of nature,\nthe corporeal and spiritual. For whilst I know, by seeing or hearing,\n&c., that there is some corporeal being without me, the object of that\nsensation, I do more certainly know, that there is some spiritual being\nwithin me that sees and hears. This, I must be convinced, cannot be the\naction of bare insensible matter; nor ever could be, without an\nimmaterial thinking being.\n16. No Idea of abstract Substance either in Body or Spirit.\nBy the complex idea of extended, figured, coloured, and all other\nsensible qualities, which is all that we know of it, we are as far from\nthe idea of the substance of body, as if we knew nothing at all: nor\nafter all the acquaintance and familiarity which we imagine we have\nwith matter, and the many qualities men assure themselves they perceive\nand know in bodies, will it perhaps upon examination be found, that\nthey have any more or clearer primary ideas belonging to body, than\nthey have belonging to immaterial spirit.\n17. Cohesion of solid parts and Impulse, the primary ideas peculiar to\nBody.\nThe primary ideas we have PECULIAR TO BODY, as contradistinguished to\nspirit, are the COHESION OF SOLID, AND CONSEQUENTLY SEPARABLE, PARTS,\nand a POWER OF COMMUNICATING MOTION BY IMPULSE. These, I think, are the\noriginal ideas proper and peculiar to body; for figure is but the\nconsequence of finite extension.\n18. Thinking and Motivity\nThe ideas we have belonging and PECULIAR TO SPIRIT, are THINKING, and\nWILL, or A POWER OF PUTTING BODY INTO MOTION BY THOUGHT, AND, WHICH IS\nCONSEQUENT TO IT, LIBERTY. For, as body cannot but communicate its\nmotion by impulse to another body, which it meets with at rest, so the\nmind can put bodies into motion, or forbear to do so, as it pleases.\nThe ideas of EXISTENCE, DURATION, and MOBILITY, are common to them\nboth.\n19. Spirits capable of Motion.\nThere is no reason why it should be thought strange that I make\nmobility belong to spirit; for having no other idea of motion, but\nchange of distance with other beings that are considered as at rest;\nand finding that spirits, as well as bodies, cannot operate but where\nthey are; and that spirits do operate at several times in several\nplaces, I cannot but attribute change of place to all finite spirits:\n(for of the Infinite Spirit I speak not here). For my soul, being a\nreal being as well as my body, is certainly as capable of changing\ndistance with any other body, or being, as body itself; and so is\ncapable of motion. And if a mathematician can consider a certain\ndistance, or a change of that distance between two points, one may\ncertainly conceive a distance and a change of distance, between two\nspirits; and so conceive their motion, their approach or removal, one\nfrom another.\n20. Proof of this.\nEvery one finds in himself that his soul can think, will, and operate\non his body in the place where that is, but cannot operate on a body,\nor in a place, an hundred miles distant from it. Nobody can imagine\nthat his soul can think or move a body at Oxford, whilst he is at\nLondon; and cannot but know, that, being united to his body, it\nconstantly changes place all the whole journey between Oxford and\nLondon, as the coach or horse does that carries him, and I think may be\nsaid to be truly all that while in motion or if that will not be\nallowed to afford us a clear idea enough of its motion, its being\nseparated from the body in death, I think, will; for to consider it as\ngoing out of the body, or leaving it, and yet to have no idea of its\nmotion, seems to me impossible.\n21. God immoveable because infinite.\nIf it be said by any one that it cannot change place, because it hath\nnone, for the spirits are not IN LOCO, but UBI; I suppose that way of\ntalking will not now be of much weight to many, in an age that is not\nmuch disposed to admire, or suffer themselves to be deceived by such\nunintelligible ways of speaking. But if any one thinks there is any\nsense in that distinction, and that it is applicable to our present\npurpose, I desire him to put it into intelligible English; and then\nfrom thence draw a reason to show that immaterial spirits are not\ncapable of motion. Indeed motion cannot be attributed to God; not\nbecause he is an immaterial, but because he is an infinite spirit.\n22. Our complex idea of an immaterial Spirit and our complex idea of\nBody compared.\nLet us compare, then, our complex idea of an immaterial spirit with our\ncomplex idea of body, and see whether there be any more obscurity in\none than in the other, and in which most. Our idea of BODY, as I think,\nis AN EXTENDED SOLID SUBSTANCE, CAPABLE OF COMMUNICATING MOTION BY\nIMPULSE: and our idea of SOUL, AS AN IMMATERIAL SPIRIT, is of A\nSUBSTANCE THAT THINKS, AND HAS A POWER OF EXCITING MOTION IN BODY, BY\nWILLING, OR THOUGHT. These, I think, are our complex ideas of soul and\nbody, as contradistinguished; and now let us examine which has most\nobscurity in it, and difficulty to be apprehended. I know that people\nwhose thoughts are immersed in matter, and have so subjected their\nminds to their senses that they seldom reflect on anything beyond them,\nare apt to say, they cannot comprehend a THINKING thing which perhaps\nis true: but I affirm, when they consider it well, they can no more\ncomprehend an EXTENDED thing.\n23. Cohesion of solid Parts in Body as hard to be conceived as thinking\nin a Soul.\nIf any one says he knows not what it is thinks in him, he means he\nknows not what the substance is of that thinking thing: No more, say I,\nknows he what the substance is of that solid thing. Further, if he says\nhe knows not how he thinks, I answer, Neither knows he how he is\nextended, how the solid parts of body are united or cohere together to\nmake extension. For though the pressure of the particles of air may\naccount for the cohesion of several parts of matter that are grosser\nthan the particles of air, and have pores less than the corpuscles of\nair, yet the weight or pressure of the air will not explain, nor can be\na cause of the coherence of the particles of air themselves. And if the\npressure of the aether, or any subtiler matter than the air, may unite,\nand hold fast together, the parts of a particle of air, as well as\nother bodies, yet it cannot make bonds for ITSELF, and hold together\nthe parts that make up every the least corpuscle of that MATERIA\nSUBTILIS. So that that hypothesis, how ingeniously soever explained, by\nshowing that the parts of sensible bodies are held together by the\npressure of other external insensible bodies, reaches not the parts of\nthe aether itself; and by how much the more evident it proves, that the\nparts of other bodies are held together by the external pressure of the\naether, and can have no other conceivable cause of their cohesion and\nunion, by so much the more it leaves us in the dark concerning the\ncohesion of the parts of the corpuscles of the aether itself: which we\ncan neither conceive without parts, they being bodies, and divisible,\nnor yet how their parts cohere, they wanting that cause of cohesion\nwhich is given of the cohesion of the parts of all other bodies.\n24. Not explained by an ambient fluid.\nBut, in truth, the pressure of any ambient fluid, how great soever, can\nbe no intelligible cause of the cohesion of the solid parts of matter.\nFor, though such a pressure may hinder the avulsion of two polished\nsuperficies, one from another, in a line perpendicular to them, as in\nthe experiment of two polished marbles; yet it can never in the least\nhinder the separation by a motion, in a line parallel to those\nsurfaces. Because the ambient fluid, having a full liberty to succeed\nin each point of space, deserted by a lateral motion, resists such a\nmotion of bodies, so joined, no more than it would resist the motion of\nthat body were it on all sides environed by that fluid, and touched no\nother body; and therefore, if there were no other cause of cohesion,\nall parts of bodies must be easily separable by such a lateral sliding\nmotion. For if the pressure of the aether be the adequate cause of\ncohesion, wherever that cause operates not, there can be no cohesion.\nAnd since it cannot operate against a lateral separation, (as has been\nshown,) therefore in every imaginary plane, intersecting any mass of\nmatter, there could be no more cohesion than of two polished surfaces,\nwhich will always, notwithstanding any imaginable pressure of a fluid,\neasily slide one from another. So that perhaps, how clear an idea\nsoever we think we have of the extension of body, which is nothing but\nthe cohesion of solid parts, he that shall well consider it in his\nmind, may have reason to conclude, That it is as easy for him to have a\nclear idea how the soul thinks as how body is extended. For, since body\nis no further, nor otherwise, extended, than by the union and cohesion\nof its solid parts, we shall very ill comprehend the extension of body,\nwithout understanding wherein consists the union and cohesion of its\nparts; which seems to me as incomprehensible as the manner of thinking,\nand how it is performed.\nWe can as little understand how the parts cohere in extension as how\nour spirits perceive or move.\n25. I allow it is usual for most people to wonder how any one should\nfind a difficulty in what they think they every day observe. Do we not\nsee (will they be ready to say) the parts of bodies stick firmly\ntogether? Is there anything more common? And what doubt can there be\nmade of it? And the like, I say, concerning thinking and voluntary\nmotion. Do we not every moment experiment it in ourselves, and\ntherefore can it be doubted? The matter of fact is clear, I confess;\nbut when we would a little nearer look into it, both in the one and the\nother; and can as little understand how the parts of body cohere, as\nhow we ourselves perceive or move. I would have any one intelligibly\nexplain to me how the parts of gold, or brass, (that but now in fusion\nwere as loose from one another as the particles of water, or the sands\nof an hour-glass,) come in a few moments to be so united, and adhere so\nstrongly one to another, that the utmost force of men\u2019s arms cannot\nseparate them? A considering man will, I suppose, be here at a loss to\nsatisfy his own, or another man\u2019s understanding.\n26. The cause of coherence of atoms in extended substances\nincomprehensible.\nThe little bodies that compose that fluid we call water are so\nextremely small, that I have never heard of any one who, by a\nmicroscope, (and yet I have heard of some that have magnified to ten\nthousand; nay, to much above a hundred thousand times,) pretended to\nperceive their distinct bulk, figure, or motion; and the particles of\nwater are also so perfectly loose one from another, that the least\nforce sensibly separates them. Nay, if we consider their perpetual\nmotion, we must allow them to have no cohesion one with another; and\nyet let but a sharp cold come, and they unite, they consolidate; these\nlittle atoms cohere, and are not, without great force, separable. He\nthat could find the bonds that tie these heaps of loose little bodies\ntogether so firmly; he that could make known the cement that makes them\nstick so fast one to another, would discover a great and yet unknown\nsecret: and yet when that was done, would he be far enough from making\nthe extension of body (which is the cohesion of its solid parts)\nintelligible, till he could show wherein consisted the union, or\nconsolidation of the parts of those bonds or of that cement, or of the\nleast particle of matter that exists. Whereby it appears that this\nprimary and supposed obvious quality of body will be found, when\nexamined, to be as incomprehensible as anything belonging to our minds,\nand a solid extended substance as hard to be conceived as a thinking\nimmaterial one, whatever difficulties some would raise against it.\n27. The supposed pressure [*dropped word] explain cohesion is\nunintelligible.\nFor, to extend our thoughts a little further, the pressure which is\nbrought to explain the cohesion of bodies [*dropped line] considered,\nas no doubt it is, finite, let any one send his contemplation to the\nextremities of the universe, and there see what conceivable hoops, what\nbond he can imagine to hold this mass of matter in so close a pressure\ntogether; from whence steel has its firmness, and the parts of a\ndiamond their hardness and indissolubility. If matter be finite, it\nmust have its extremes; and there must be something to hinder it from\nscattering asunder. If, to avoid this difficulty, any one will throw\nhimself into the supposition and abyss of infinite matter, let him\nconsider what light he thereby brings to the cohesion of body, and\nwhether he be ever the nearer making it intelligible, by resolving it\ninto a supposition the most absurd and most incomprehensible of all\nother: so far is our extension of body (which is nothing but the\ncohesion of solid parts) from being clearer, or more distinct, when we\nwould inquire into the nature, cause, or manner of it, than the idea of\nthinking.\n28. Communication of Motion by Impulse, or by Thought, equally\nunintelligible.\nAnother idea we have of body is, THE POWER OF COMMUNICATION OF MOTION\nBY IMPULSE; and of our souls, THE POWER OF EXCITING MOTION BY THOUGHT.\nThese ideas, the one of body, the other of our minds, every day\u2019s\nexperience clearly furnishes us with: but if here again we inquire how\nthis is done, we are equally in the dark. For, in the communication of\nmotion by impulse, wherein as much motion is lost to one body as is got\nto the other, which is the ordinariest case, we can have no other\nconception, but of the passing of motion out of one body into another;\nwhich, I think, is as obscure and inconceivable as how our minds move\nor stop our bodies by thought, which we every moment find they do. The\nincrease of motion by impulse, which is observed or believed sometimes\nto happen, is yet harder to be understood. We have by daily experience\nclear evidence of motion produced both by impulse and by thought; but\nthe manner how, hardly comes within our comprehension: we are equally\nat a loss in both. So that, however we consider motion, and its\ncommunication, either from body or spirit, the idea which belongs to\nspirit is at least as clear as that which belongs to body. And if we\nconsider the active power of moving, or, as I may call it, motivity, it\nis much clearer in spirit than body; since two bodies, placed by one\nanother at rest, will never afford us the idea of a power in the one to\nmove the other, but by a borrowed motion: whereas the mind every day\naffords us ideas of an active power of moving of bodies; and therefore\nit is worth our consideration, whether active power be not the proper\nattribute of spirits, and passive power of matter. Hence may be\nconjectured that created spirits are not totally separate from matter,\nbecause they are both active and passive. Pure spirit, viz. God, is\nonly active; pure matter is only passive; those beings that are both\nactive and passive, we may judge to partake of both. But be that as it\nwill, I think, we have as many and as clear ideas belonging to spirit\nas we have belonging to body, the substance of each being equally\nunknown to us; and the idea of thinking in spirit, as clear as of\nextension in body; and the communication of motion by thought, which we\nattribute to spirit, is as evident as that by impulse, which we ascribe\nto body. Constant experience makes us sensible of both these, though\nour narrow understandings can comprehend neither. For, when the mind\nwould look beyond those original ideas we have from sensation or\nreflection, and penetrate into their causes, and manner of production,\nwe find still it discovers nothing but its own short-sightedness.\n29. Summary.\nTo conclude. Sensation convinces us that there are solid extended\nsubstances; and reflection, that there are thinking ones: experience\nassures us of the existence of such beings, and that the one hath a\npower to move body by impulse, the other by thought; this we cannot\ndoubt of. Experience, I say, every moment furnishes us with the clear\nideas both of the one and the other. But beyond these ideas, as\nreceived from their proper sources, our faculties will not reach. If we\nwould inquire further into their nature, causes, and manner, we\nperceive not the nature of extension clearer than we do of thinking. If\nwe would explain them any further, one is as easy as the other; and\nthere is no more difficulty to conceive how A SUBSTANCE WE KNOW NOT\nshould, by thought, set body into motion, than how A SUBSTANCE WE KNOW\nNOT should, by impulse, set body into motion. So that we are no more\nable to discover wherein the ideas belonging to body consist, than\nthose belonging to spirit. From whence it seems probable to me, that\nthe simple ideas we receive from sensation and reflection are the\nboundaries of our thoughts; beyond which the mind, whatever efforts it\nwould make, is not able to advance one jot; nor can it make any\ndiscoveries, when it would pry into the nature and hidden causes of\nthose ideas.\n30. Our idea of Spirit and our idea of Body compared.\nSo that, in short, the idea we have of spirit, compared with the idea\nwe have of body, stands thus: the substance of spirits is unknown to\nus; and so is the substance of body equally unknown to us. Two primary\nqualities or properties of body, viz. solid coherent parts and impulse,\nwe have distinct clear ideas of: so likewise we know, and have distinct\nclear ideas, of two primary qualities or properties of spirit, viz.\nthinking, and a power of action; i.e. a power of beginning or stopping\nseveral thoughts or motions. We have also the ideas of several\nqualities inherent in bodies, and have the clear distinct ideas of\nthem; which qualities are but the various modifications of the\nextension of cohering solid parts, and their motion. We have likewise\nthe ideas of the several modes of thinking viz. believing, doubting,\nintending, fearing, hoping; all which are but the several modes of\nthinking. We have also the ideas of willing, and moving the body\nconsequent to it, and with the body itself too; for, as has been shown,\nspirit is capable of motion.\n31. The Notion of Spirit involves no more Difficulty in it than that of\nBody.\nLastly, if this notion of immaterial spirit may have, perhaps, some\ndifficulties in it not easily to be explained, we have therefore no\nmore reason to deny or doubt the existence of such spirits, than we\nhave to deny or doubt the existence of body; because the notion of body\nis cumbered with some difficulties very hard, and perhaps impossible to\nbe explained or understood by us. For I would fain have instanced\nanything in our notion of spirit more perplexed, or nearer a\ncontradiction, than the very notion of body includes in it; the\ndivisibility IN INFINITUM of any finite extension involving us, whether\nwe grant or deny it, in consequences impossible to be explicated or\nmade in our apprehensions consistent; consequences that carry greater\ndifficulty, and more apparent absurdity, than anything can follow from\nthe notion of an immaterial knowing substance.\n32. We know nothing of things beyond our simple Ideas of them.\nWhich we are not at all to wonder at, since we having but some few\nsuperficial ideas of things, discovered to us only by the senses from\nwithout, or by the mind, reflecting on what it experiments in itself\nwithin, have no knowledge beyond that, much less of the internal\nconstitution, and true nature of things, being destitute of faculties\nto attain it. And therefore experimenting and discovering in ourselves\nknowledge, and the power of voluntary motion, as certainly as we\nexperiment, or discover in things without us, the cohesion and\nseparation of solid parts, which is the extension and motion of bodies;\nwe have as much reason to be satisfied with our notion of immaterial\nspirit, as with our notion of body, and the existence of the one as\nwell as the other. For it being no more a contradiction that thinking\nshould exist separate and independent from solidity, than it is a\ncontradiction that solidity should exist separate and independent from\nthinking, they being both but simple ideas, independent one from\nanother and having as clear and distinct ideas in us of thinking as of\nsolidity, I know not why we may not as well allow a thinking thing\nwithout solidity, i.e. immaterial, to exist, as a solid thing without\nthinking, i.e. matter, to exist; especially since it is not harder to\nconceive how thinking should exist without matter, than how matter\nshould think. For whensoever we would proceed beyond these simple ideas\nwe have from sensation and reflection and dive further into the nature\nof things, we fall presently into darkness and obscurity, perplexedness\nand difficulties, and can discover nothing further but our own\nblindness and ignorance. But whichever of these complex ideas be\nclearest, that of body, or immaterial spirit, this is evident, that the\nsimple ideas that make them up are no other than what we have received\nfrom sensation or reflection: and so is it of all our other ideas of\nsubstances, even of God himself.\n33. Our complex idea of God.\nFor if we examine the idea we have of the incomprehensible Supreme\nBeing, we shall find that we come by it the same way; and that the\ncomplex ideas we have both of God, and separate spirits, are made of\nthe simple ideas we receive from reflection; v.g. having, from what we\nexperiment in ourselves, got the ideas of existence and duration; of\nknowledge and power; of pleasure and happiness; and of several other\nqualities and powers, which it is better to have than to be without;\nwhen we would frame an idea the most suitable we can to the Supreme\nBeing, we enlarge every one of these with our idea of infinity; and so\nputting them together, make our complex idea of God. For that the mind\nhas such a power of enlarging some of its ideas, received from\nsensation and reflection, has been already shown.\n34. Our complex idea of God as infinite.\nIf I find that I know some few things, and some of them, or all,\nperhaps imperfectly, I can frame an idea of knowing twice as many;\nwhich I can double again, as often as I can add to number; and thus\nenlarge my idea of knowledge, by extending its comprehension to all\nthings existing, or possible. The same also I can do of knowing them\nmore perfectly; i.e. all their qualities, powers, causes, consequences,\nand relations, &c., till all be perfectly known that is in them, or can\nany way relate to them: and thus frame the idea of infinite or\nboundless knowledge. The same may also be done of power, till we come\nto that we call infinite; and also of the duration of existence,\nwithout beginning or end, and so frame the idea of an eternal being.\nThe degrees or extent wherein we ascribe existence, power, wisdom, and\nall other perfections (which we can have any ideas of) to that\nsovereign Being, which we call G-d, being all boundless and infinite,\nwe frame the best idea of him our minds are capable of: all which is\ndone, I say, by enlarging those simple ideas we have taken from the\noperations of our own minds, by reflection; or by our senses, from\nexterior things, to that vastness to which infinity can extend them.\n35. God in his own essence incognisable.\nFor it is infinity, which, joined to our ideas of existence, power,\nknowledge, &c., makes that complex idea, whereby we represent to\nourselves, the best we can, the Supreme Being. For, though in his own\nessence (which certainly we do not know, not knowing the real essence\nof a pebble, or a fly, or of our own selves) God be simple and\nuncompounded; yet I think I may say we have no other idea of him, but a\ncomplex one of existence, knowledge, power, happiness, &c., infinite\nand eternal: which are all distinct ideas, and some of them, being\nrelative, are again compounded of others: all which being, as has been\nshown, originally got from sensation and reflection, go to make up the\nidea or notion we have of God.\n36. No Ideas in our complex ideas of Spirits, but those got from\nSensation or Reflection.\nThis further is to be observed, that there is no idea we attribute to\nGod, bating infinity, which is not also a part of our complex idea of\nother spirits. Because, being capable of no other simple ideas,\nbelonging to anything but body, but those which by reflection we\nreceive from the operation of our own minds, we can attribute to\nspirits no other but what we receive from thence: and all the\ndifference we can put between them, in our contemplation of spirits, is\nonly in the several extents and degrees of their knowledge, power,\nduration, happiness, &c. For that in our ideas, as well of spirits as\nof other things, we are restrained to THOSE WE RECEIVE FROM SENSATION\nAND REFLECTION, is evident from hence,\u2014That, in our ideas of spirits,\nhow much soever advanced in perfection beyond those of bodies, even to\nthat of infinite, we cannot yet have any idea of the manner wherein\nthey discover their thoughts one to another: though we must necessarily\nconclude that separate spirits, which are beings that have perfecter\nknowledge and greater happiness than we, must needs have also a\nperfecter way of communicating their thoughts than we have, who are\nfain to make use of corporeal signs, and particular sounds; which are\ntherefore of most general use, as being the best and quickest we are\ncapable of. But of immediate communication having no experiment in\nourselves, and consequently no notion of it at all, we have no idea how\nspirits, which use not words, can with quickness; or much less how\nspirits that have no bodies can be masters of their own thoughts, and\ncommunicate or conceal them at pleasure, though we cannot but\nnecessarily suppose they have such a power.\n37. Recapitulation.\nAnd thus we have seen what kind of ideas we have of SUBSTANCES OF ALL\nKINDS, wherein they consist, and how we came by them. From whence, I\nthink, it is very evident,\nFirst, That all our ideas of the several SORTS of substances are\nnothing but collections of simple ideas: with a supposition of\nSOMETHING to which they belong, and in which they subsist; though of\nthis supposed something we have no clear distinct idea at all.\nSecondly, That all the simple ideas, that thus united in one common\nSUBSTRATUM, make up our complex ideas of several SORTS of substances,\nare no other but such as we have received from sensation or reflection.\nSo that even in those which we think we are most intimately acquainted\nwith, and that come nearest the comprehension of our most enlarged\nconceptions, we cannot go beyond those simple ideas. And even in those\nwhich seem most remote from all we have to do with, and do infinitely\nsurpass anything we can perceive in ourselves by reflection; or\ndiscover by sensation in other things, we can attain to nothing but\nthose simple ideas, which we originally received from sensation or\nreflection; as is evident in the complex ideas we have of angels, and\nparticularly of God himself.\nThirdly, That most of the simple ideas that make up our complex ideas\nof substances, when truly considered, are only POWERS, however we are\napt to take them for positive qualities; v.g. the greatest part of the\nideas that make our complex idea of GOLD are yellowness, great weight,\nductility, fusibility, and solubility in AQUA REGIA, &c., all united\ntogether in an unknown SUBSTRATUM: all which ideas are nothing else but\nso many relations to other substances; and are not really in the gold,\nconsidered barely in itself, though they depend on those real and\nprimary qualities of its internal constitution, whereby it has a\nfitness differently to operate, and be operated on by several other\nsubstances.\nCHAPTER XXIV.\nOF COLLECTIVE IDEAS OF SUBSTANCES.\n1. A collective idea is one Idea.\nBesides these complex ideas of several SINGLE substances, as of man,\nhorse, gold, violet, apple, &c., the mind hath also complex COLLECTIVE\nideas of substances; which I so call, because such ideas are made up of\nmany particular substances considered together, as united into one\nidea, and which so joined; are looked on as one; v. g. the idea of such\na collection of men as make an ARMY, though consisting of a great\nnumber of distinct substances, is as much one idea as the idea of a\nman: and the great collective idea of all bodies whatsoever, signified\nby the name WORLD, is as much one idea as the idea of any the least\nparticle of matter in it; it sufficing to the unity of any idea, that\nit be considered as one representation or picture, though made up of\never so many particulars.\n2. Made by the Power of composing in the Mind.\nThese collective ideas of substances the mind makes, by its power of\ncomposition, and uniting severally either simple or complex ideas into\none, as it does, by the same faculty, make the complex ideas of\nparticular substances, consisting of an aggregate of divers simple\nideas, united in one substance. And as the mind, by putting together\nthe repeated ideas of unity, makes the collective mode, or complex\nidea, of any number, as a score, or a gross, &c.,\u2014so, by putting\ntogether several particular substances, it makes collective ideas of\nsubstances, as a troop, an army, a swarm, a city, a fleet; each of\nwhich every one finds that he represents to his own mind by one idea,\nin one view; and so under that notion considers those several things as\nperfectly one, as one ship, or one atom. Nor is it harder to conceive\nhow an army of ten thousand men should make one idea than how a man\nshould make one idea; it being as easy to the mind to unite into one\nthe idea of a great number of men, and consider it as one as it is to\nunite into one particular all the distinct ideas that make up the\ncomposition of a man, and consider them all together as one.\n3. Artificial things that are made up of distinct substances are our\ncollective Ideas.\nAmongst such kind of collective ideas are to be counted most part of\nartificial things, at least such of them as are made up of distinct\nsubstances: and, in truth, if we consider all these collective ideas\naright, as ARMY, CONSTELLATION, UNIVERSE, as they are united into so\nmany single ideas, they are but the artificial draughts of the mind;\nbringing things very remote, and independent on one another, into one\nview, the better to contemplate and discourse on them, united into one\nconception, and signified by one name. For there are no things so\nremote, nor so contrary, which the mind cannot, by this art of\ncomposition, bring into one idea; as is visible in that signified by\nthe name UNIVERSE.\nCHAPTER XXV.\nOF RELATION.\n1. Relation, what.\nBESIDES the ideas, whether simple or complex, that the mind has of\nthings as they are in themselves, there are others it gets from their\ncomparison one with another. The understanding, in the consideration of\nanything, is not confined to that precise object: it can carry any idea\nas it were beyond itself, or at least look beyond it, to see how it\nstands in conformity to any other. When the mind so considers one\nthing, that it does as it were bring it to, and set it by another, and\ncarries its view from one to the other\u2014this is, as the words import,\nRELATION and RESPECT; and the denominations given to positive things,\nintimating that respect, and serving as marks to lead the thoughts\nbeyond the subject itself denominated, to something distinct from it,\nare what we call RELATIVES; and the things so brought together,\nRELATED. Thus, when the mind considers Caius as such a positive being,\nit takes nothing into that idea but what really exists in Caius; v.g.\nwhen I consider him as a man, I have nothing in my mind but the complex\nidea of the species, man. So likewise, when I say Caius is a white man,\nI have nothing but the bare consideration of a man who hath that white\ncolour. But when I give Caius the name HUSBAND, I intimate some other\nperson; and when I give him the name WHITER, I intimate some other\nthing: in both cases my thought is led to something beyond Caius, and\nthere are two things brought into consideration. And since any idea,\nwhether simple or complex, may be the occasion why the mind thus brings\ntwo things together, and as it were takes a view of them at once,\nthough still considered as distinct: therefore any of our ideas may be\nthe foundation of relation. As in the above-mentioned instance, the\ncontract and ceremony of marriage with Sempronia is the occasion of the\ndenomination and relation of husband; and the colour white the occasion\nwhy he is said to be whiter than free-stone.\n2. Ideas of relations without correlative Terms, not easily\napprehended.\nThese and the like relations, expressed by relative terms that have\nothers answering them, with a reciprocal intimation, as father and son,\nbigger and less, cause and effect, are very obvious to every one, and\neverybody at first sight perceives the relation. For father and son,\nhusband and wife, and such other correlative terms, seem so nearly to\nbelong one to another, and, through custom, do so readily chime and\nanswer one another in people\u2019s memories, that, upon the naming of\neither of them, the thoughts are presently carried beyond the thing so\nnamed; and nobody overlooks or doubts of a relation, where it is so\nplainly intimated. But where languages have failed to give correlative\nnames, there the relation is not always so easily taken notice of.\nCONCUBINE is, no doubt, a relative name, as well as wife: but in\nlanguages where this and the like words have not a correlative term,\nthere people are not so apt to take them to be so, as wanting that\nevident mark of relation which is between correlatives, which seem to\nexplain one another, and not to be able to exist, but together. Hence\nit is, that many of those names, which, duly considered, do include\nevident relations, have been called EXTERNAL DENOMINATIONS. But all\nnames that are more than empty sounds must signify some idea, which is\neither in the thing to which the name is applied, and then it is\npositive, and is looked on as united to and existing in the thing to\nwhich the denomination is given; or else it arises from the respect the\nmind finds in it to something distinct from it, with which it considers\nit, and then it includes a relation.\n3. Some seemingly absolute Terms contain Relations.\nAnother sort of relative terms there is, which are not looked on to be\neither relative, or so much as external denominations: which yet, under\nthe form and appearance of signifying something absolute in the\nsubject, do conceal a tacit, though less observable, relation. Such are\nthe seemingly positive terms of OLD, GREAT, IMPERFECT, &c., whereof I\nshall have occasion to speak more at large in the following chapters.\n4. Relation different from the Things related.\nThis further may be observed, That the ideas of relations may be the\nsame in men who have far different ideas of the things that are\nrelated, or that are thus compared: v. g. those who have far different\nideas of a man, may yet agree in the notion of a father; which is a\nnotion superinduced to the substance, or man, and refers only to an act\nof that thing called man whereby he contributed to the generation of\none of his own kind, let man be what it will.\n5. Change of Relation may be without any Change in the things related.\nThe nature therefore of relation consists in the referring or comparing\ntwo things one to another; from which comparison one or both comes to\nbe denominated. And if either of those things be removed, or cease to\nbe, the relation ceases, and the denomination consequent to it, though\nthe other receive in itself no alteration at all; v.g. Caius, whom I\nconsider to-day as a father, ceases to be so to-morrow, only by the\ndeath of his son, without any alteration made in himself. Nay, barely\nby the mind\u2019s changing the object to which it compares anything, the\nsame thing is capable of having contrary denominations at the same\ntime: v.g. Caius, compared to several persons, may truly be said to be\nolder and younger, stronger and weaker, &c.\n6. Relation only betwixt two things.\nWhatsoever doth or can exist, or be considered as one thing is\npositive: and so not only simple ideas and substances, but modes also,\nare positive beings: though the parts of which they consist are very\noften relative one to another: but the whole together considered as one\nthing, and producing in us the complex idea of one thing, which idea is\nin our minds, as one picture, though an aggregate of divers parts, and\nunder one name, it is a positive or absolute thing, or idea. Thus a\ntriangle, though the parts thereof compared one to another be relative,\nyet the idea of the whole is a positive absolute idea. The same may be\nsaid of a family, a tune, &c.; for there can be no relation but betwixt\ntwo things considered as two things. There must always be in relation\ntwo ideas or things, either in themselves really separate, or\nconsidered as distinct, and then a ground or occasion for their\ncomparison.\n7. All Things capable of Relation.\nConcerning relation in general, these things may be considered:\nFirst, That there is no one thing, whether simple idea, substance,\nmode, or relation, or name of either of them, which is not capable of\nalmost an infinite number of considerations in reference to other\nthings: and therefore this makes no small part of men\u2019s thoughts and\nwords: v.g. one single man may at once be concerned in, and sustain all\nthese following relations, and many more, viz. father, brother, son,\ngrandfather, grandson, father-in-law, son-in-law, husband, friend,\nenemy, subject, general, judge, patron, client, professor, European,\nEnglishman, islander, servant, master, possessor, captain, superior,\ninferior, bigger, less, older, younger, contemporary, like, unlike,\n&c., to an almost infinite number: he being capable of as many\nrelations as there can be occasions of comparing him to other things,\nin any manner of agreement, disagreement, or respect whatsoever. For,\nas I said, relation is a way of comparing or considering two things\n[*dropped line] from that comparison; and sometimes giving even the\nrelation itself a name.\n8. Our Ideas of Relations often clearer than of the Subjects related.\nSecondly, This further may be considered concerning relation, that\nthough it be not contained in the real existence of things, but\nsomething extraneous and superinduced, yet the ideas which relative\nwords stand for are often clearer and more distinct than of those\nsubstances to which they do belong. The notion we have of a father or\nbrother is a great deal clearer and more distinct than that we have of\na man; or, if you will, PATERNITY is a thing whereof it is easier to\nhave a clear idea, than of HUMANITY; and I can much easier conceive\nwhat a friend is, than what God; because the knowledge of one action,\nor one simple idea, is oftentimes sufficient to give me the notion of a\nrelation; but to the knowing of any substantial being, an accurate\ncollection of sundry ideas is necessary. A man, if he compares two\nthings together, can hardly be supposed not to know what it is wherein\nhe compares them: so that when he compares any things together, he\ncannot but have a very clear idea of that relation. THE IDEAS, THEN, OF\nRELATIONS, ARE CAPABLE AT LEAST OF BEING MORE PERFECT AND DISTINCT IN\nOUR MINDS THAN THOSE OF SUBSTANCES. Because it is commonly hard to know\nall the simple ideas which are really in any substance, but for the\nmost part easy enough to know the simple ideas that make up any\nrelation I think on, or have a name for: v.g. comparing two men in\nreference to one common parent, it is very easy to frame the ideas of\nbrothers, without having yet the perfect idea of a man. For significant\nrelative words, as well as others, standing only for ideas; and those\nbeing all either simple, or made up of simple ones, it suffices for the\nknowing the precise idea the relative term stands for, to have a clear\nconception of that which is the foundation of the relation; which may\nbe done without having a perfect and clear idea of the thing it is\nattributed to. Thus, having the notion that one laid the egg out of\nwhich the other was hatched, I have a clear idea of the relation of DAM\nand CHICK between the two cassiowaries in St. James\u2019s Park; though\nperhaps I have but a very obscure and imperfect idea of those birds\nthemselves.\n9. Relations all terminate in simple Ideas.\nThirdly, Though there be a great number of considerations wherein\nthings may be compared one with another, and so a multitude of\nrelations, yet they all terminate in, and are concerned about those\nsimple ideas, either of sensation or reflection, which I think to be\nthe whole materials of all our knowledge. To clear this, I shall show\nit in the most considerable relations that we have any notion of; and\nin some that seem to be the most remote from sense or reflection: which\nyet will appear to have their ideas from thence, and leave it past\ndoubt that the notions we have of them are but certain simple ideas,\nand so originally derived from sense or reflection.\n10. Terms leading the Mind beyond the Subject denominated, are\nrelative.\nFourthly, That relation being the considering of one thing with another\nwhich is extrinsical to it, it is evident that all words that\nnecessarily lead the mind to any other ideas than are supposed really\nto exist in that thing to which the words are applied are relative\nwords: v.g.a MAN, BLACK, MERRY, THOUGHTFUL, THIRSTY, ANGRY, EXTENDED;\nthese and the like are all absolute, because they neither signify nor\nintimate anything but what does or is supposed really to exist in the\nman thus denominated; but FATHER, BROTHER, KING, HUSBAND, BLACKER,\nMERRIER, &c., are words which, together with the thing they denominate,\nimply also something else separate and exterior to the existence of\nthat thing.\n11. All relatives made up of simple ideas.\nHaving laid down these premises concerning relation in general, I shall\nnow proceed to show, in some instances, how all the ideas we have of\nrelation are made up, as the others are, only of simple ideas; and that\nthey all, how refined or remote from sense soever they seem, terminate\nat last in simple ideas. I shall begin with the most comprehensive\nrelation, wherein all things that do, or can exist, are concerned, and\nthat is the relation of CAUSE and EFFECT: the idea whereof, how derived\nfrom the two fountains of all our knowledge, sensation and reflection,\nI shall in the next place consider.\nCHAPTER XXVI.\nOF CAUSE AND EFFECT, AND OTHER RELATIONS.\n1. Whence the Ideas of cause and effect got.\nIn the notice that our senses take of the constant vicissitude of\nthings, we cannot but observe that several particular, both qualities\nand substances, begin to exist; and that they receive this their\nexistence from the due application and operation of some other being.\nFrom this observation we get our ideas of CAUSE and EFFECT. THAT WHICH\nPRODUCES ANY SIMPLE OR COMPLEX IDEA we denote by the general name,\nCAUSE, and THAT WHICH IS PRODUCED, EFFECT. Thus, finding that in that\nsubstance which we call wax, fluidity, which is a simple idea that was\nnot in it before, is constantly produced by the application of a\ncertain degree of heat we call the simple idea of heat, in relation to\nfluidity in wax, the cause of it, and fluidity the effect. So also,\nfinding that the substance, wood, which is a certain collection of\nsimple ideas so called, by the application of fire, is turned into\nanother substance, called ashes; i. e., another complex idea,\nconsisting of a collection of simple ideas, quite different from that\ncomplex idea which we call wood; we consider fire, in relation to\nashes, as cause, and the ashes, as effect. So that whatever is\nconsidered by us to conduce or operate to the producing any particular\nsimple idea, or collection of simple ideas, whether substance or mode,\nwhich did not before exist, hath thereby in our minds the relation of a\ncause, and so is denominated by us.\n2. Creation Generation, making Alteration.\nHaving thus, from what our senses are able to discover in the\noperations of bodies on one another, got the notion of cause and\neffect, viz. that a cause is that which makes any other thing, either\nsimple idea, substance, or mode, begin to be; and an effect is that\nwhich had its beginning from some other thing; the mind finds no great\ndifficulty to distinguish the several originals of things into two\nsorts:\u2014\nFirst, When the thing is wholly made new, so that no part thereof did\never exist before; as when a new particle of matter doth begin to\nexist, IN RERUM NATURA, which had before no being, and this we call\nCREATION.\nSecondly, When a thing is made up of particles, which did all of them\nbefore exist; but that very thing, so constituted of pre-existing\nparticles, which, considered all together, make up such a collection of\nsimple ideas, had not any existence before, as this man, this egg,\nrose, or cherry, &c. And this, when referred to a substance, produced\nin the ordinary course of nature by internal principle, but set on work\nby, and received from, some external agent, or cause, and working by\ninsensible ways which we perceive not, we call GENERATION. When the\ncause is extrinsical, and the effect produced by a sensible separation,\nor juxta-position of discernible parts, we call it MAKING; and such are\nall artificial things. When any simple idea is produced, which was not\nin that subject before, we call it ALTERATION. Thus a man is generated,\na picture made; and either of them altered, when any new sensible\nquality or simple idea is produced in either of them, which was not\nthere before: and the things thus made to exist, which were not there\nbefore, are effects; and those things which operated to the existence,\ncauses. In which, and all other cases, we may observe, that the notion\nof cause and effect has its rise from ideas received by sensation or\nreflection; and that this relation, how comprehensive soever,\nterminates at last in them. For to have the idea of cause and effect,\nit suffices to consider any simple idea or substance, as beginning to\nexist, by the operation of some other, without knowing the manner of\nthat operation.\n3. Relations of Time.\nTime and place are also the foundations of very large relations; and\nall finite beings at least are concerned in them. But having already\nshown in another place how we get those ideas, it may suffice here to\nintimate, that most of the denominations of things received from TIME\nare only relations. Thus, when any one says that Queen Elizabeth lived\nsixty-nine, and reigned forty-five years, these words import only the\nrelation of that duration to some other, and mean no more but this,\nThat the duration of her existence was equal to sixty-nine, and the\nduration of her government to forty-five annual revolutions of the sun;\nand so are all words, answering, HOW LONG? Again, William the Conqueror\ninvaded England about the year 1066; which means this, That, taking the\nduration from our Saviour\u2019s time till now for one entire great length\nof time, it shows at what distance this invasion was from the two\nextremes; and so do all words of time answering to the question, WHEN,\nwhich show only the distance of any point of time from the period of a\nlonger duration, from which we measure, and to which we thereby\nconsider it as related.\n4. Some ideas of Time supposed positive and found to be relative.\nThere are yet, besides those, other words of time, that ordinarily are\nthought to stand for positive ideas, which yet will, when considered,\nbe found to be relative; such as are, young, old, &c., which include\nand intimate the relation anything has to a certain length of duration,\nwhereof we have the idea in our minds. Thus, having settled in our\nthoughts the idea of the ordinary duration of a man to be seventy\nyears, when we say a man is YOUNG, we mean that his age is yet but a\nsmall part of that which usually men attain to; and when we denominate\nhim OLD, we mean that his duration is run out almost to the end of that\nwhich men do not usually exceed. And so it is but comparing the\nparticular age or duration of this or that man, to the idea of that\nduration which we have in our minds, as ordinarily belonging to that\nsort of animals: which is plain in the application of these names to\nother things; for a man is called young at twenty years, and very young\nat seven years old: but yet a horse we call old at twenty, and a dog at\nseven years, because in each of these we compare their age to different\nideas of duration, which are settled in our minds as belonging to these\nseveral sorts of animals, in the ordinary course of nature. But the sun\nand stars, though they have outlasted several generations of men, we\ncall not old, because we do not know what period God hath set to that\nsort of beings. This term belonging properly to those things which we\ncan observe in the ordinary course of things, by a natural decay, to\ncome to an end in a certain period of time; and so have in our minds,\nas it were, a standard to which we can compare the several parts of\ntheir duration; and, by the relation they bear thereunto, call them\nyoung or old; which we cannot, therefore, do to a ruby or a diamond,\nthings whose usual periods we know not.\n5. Relations of Place and Extension.\nThe relation also that things have to one another in their PLACES and\ndistances is very obvious to observe; as above, below, a mile distant\nfrom Charing-cross, in England, and in London. But as in duration, so\nin extension and bulk, there are some ideas that are relative which we\nsignify by names that are thought positive; as GREAT and LITTLE are\ntruly relations. For here also, having, by observation, settled in our\nminds the ideas of the bigness of several species of things from those\nwe have been most accustomed to, we make them as it were the standards,\nwhereby to denominate the bulk of others. Thus we call a great apple,\nsuch a one as is bigger than the ordinary sort of those we have been\nused to; and a little horse, such a one as comes not up to the size of\nthat idea which we have in our minds to belong ordinarily to horses;\nand that will be a great horse to a Welchman, which is but a little one\nto a Fleming; they two having, from the different breed of their\ncountries, taken several-sized ideas to which they compare, and in\nrelation to which they denominate their great and their little.\n6. Absolute Terms often stand for Relations.\nSo likewise weak and strong are but relative denominations of power,\ncompared to some ideas we have at that time of greater or less power.\nThus, when we say a weak man, we mean one that has not so much strength\nor power to move as usually men have, or usually those of his size\nhave; which is a comparing his strength to the idea we have of the\nusual strength of men, or men of such a size. The like when we say the\ncreatures are all weak things; weak there is but a relative term,\nsignifying the disproportion there is in the power of God and the\ncreatures. And so abundance of words, in ordinary speech, stand only\nfor relations (and perhaps the greatest part) which at first sight seem\nto have no such signification: v.g. the ship has necessary stores.\nNECESSARY and STORES are both relative words; one having a relation to\nthe accomplishing the voyage intended, and the other to future use. All\nwhich relations, how they are confined to, and terminate in ideas\nderived from sensation or reflection, is too obvious to need any\nexplication.\nCHAPTER XXVII.\nOF IDENTITY AND DIVERSITY.\n1. Wherein Identity consists.\nANOTHER occasion the mind often takes of comparing, is the very being\nof things, when, considering ANYTHING AS EXISTING AT ANY DETERMINED\nTIME AND PLACE, we compare it with ITSELF EXISTING AT ANOTHER TIME, and\nthereon form the ideas of IDENTITY and DIVERSITY. When we see anything\nto be in any place in any instant of time, we are sure (be it what it\nwill) that it is that very thing, and not another which at that same\ntime exists in another place, how like and undistinguishable soever it\nmay be in all other respects: and in this consists IDENTITY, when the\nideas it is attributed to vary not at all from what they were that\nmoment wherein we consider their former existence, and to which we\ncompare the present. For we never finding, nor conceiving it possible,\nthat two things of the same kind should exist in the same place at the\nsame time, we rightly conclude, that, whatever exists anywhere at any\ntime, excludes all of the same kind, and is there itself alone. When\ntherefore we demand whether anything be the SAME or no, it refers\nalways to something that existed such a time in such a place, which it\nwas certain, at that instant, was the same with itself, and no other.\nFrom whence it follows, that one thing cannot have two beginnings of\nexistence, nor two things one beginning; it being impossible for two\nthings of the same kind to be or exist in the same instant, in the very\nsame place; or one and the same thing in different places. That,\ntherefore, that had one beginning, is the same thing; and that which\nhad a different beginning in time and place from that, is not the same,\nbut diverse. That which has made the difficulty about this relation has\nbeen the little care and attention used in having precise notions of\nthe things to which it is attributed.\n2. Identity of Substances.\nWe have the ideas but of three sorts of substances: 1. GOD. 2. FINITE\nINTELLIGENCES. 3. BODIES.\nFirst, GOD is without beginning, eternal, unalterable, and everywhere,\nand therefore concerning his identity there can be no doubt.\nSecondly, FINITE SPIRITS having had each its determinated time and\nplace of beginning to exist, the relation to that time and place will\nalways determine to each of them its identity, as long as it exists.\nThirdly, The same will hold of every PARTICLE OF MATTER, to which no\naddition or subtraction of matter being made, it is the same. For,\nthough these three sorts of substances, as we term them, do not exclude\none another out of the same place, yet we cannot conceive but that they\nmust necessarily each of them exclude any of the same kind out of the\nsame place: or else the notions and names of identity and diversity\nwould be in vain, and there could be no such distinctions of\nsubstances, or anything else one from another. For example: could two\nbodies be in the same place at the same time; then those two parcels of\nmatter must be one and the same, take them great or little; nay, all\nbodies must be one and the same. For, by the same reason that two\nparticles of matter may be in one place, all bodies may be in one\nplace: which, when it can be supposed, takes away the distinction of\nidentity and diversity of one and more, and renders it ridiculous. But\nit being a contradiction that two or more should be one, identity and\ndiversity are relations and ways of comparing well founded, and of use\nto the understanding.\n3. Identity of modes and relations.\nAll other things being but modes or relations ultimately terminated in\nsubstances, the identity and diversity of each particular existence of\nthem too will be by the same way determined: only as to things whose\nexistence is in succession, such as are the actions of finite beings,\nv. g. MOTION and THOUGHT, both which consist in a continued train of\nsuccession, concerning THEIR diversity there can be no question:\nbecause each perishing the moment it begins, they cannot exist in\ndifferent times, or in different places, as permanent beings can at\ndifferent times exist in distant places; and therefore no motion or\nthought, considered as at different times, can be the same, each part\nthereof having a different beginning of existence.\n4. Principium Individuationis.\nFrom what has been said, it is easy to discover what is so much\ninquired after, the PRINCIPIUM INDIVIDUATIONIS; and that, it is plain,\nis existence itself; which determines a being of any sort to a\nparticular time and place, incommunicable to two beings of the same\nkind. This, though it seems easier to conceive in simple substances or\nmodes; yet, when reflected on, is not more difficult in compound ones,\nif care be taken to what it is applied: v.g. let us suppose an atom,\ni.e. a continued body under one immutable superficies, existing in a\ndetermined time and place; it is evident, that, considered in any\ninstant of its existence, it is in that instant the same with itself.\nFor, being at that instant what it is, and nothing else, it is the\nsame, and so must continue as long as its existence is continued; for\nso long it will be the same, and no other. In like manner, if two or\nmore atoms be joined together into the same mass, every one of those\natoms will be the same, by the foregoing rule: and whilst they exist\nunited together, the mass, consisting of the same atoms, must be the\nsame mass, or the same body, let the parts be ever so differently\njumbled. But if one of these atoms be taken away, or one new one added,\nit is no longer the same mass or the same body. In the state of living\ncreatures, their identity depends not on a mass of the same particles,\nbut on something else. For in them the variation of great parcels of\nmatter alters not the identity: an oak growing from a plant to a great\ntree, and then lopped, is still the same oak; and a colt grown up to a\nhorse, sometimes fat, sometimes lean, is all the while the same horse:\nthough, in both these cases, there may be a manifest change of the\nparts; so that truly they are not either of them the same masses of\nmatter, though they be truly one of them the same oak, and the other\nthe same horse. The reason whereof is, that, in these two cases\u2014a MASS\nOF MATTER and a LIVING BODY\u2014identity is not applied to the same thing.\n5. Identity of Vegetables.\nWe must therefore consider wherein an oak differs from a mass of\nmatter, and that seems to me to be in this, that the one is only the\ncohesion of particles of matter any how united, the other such a\ndisposition of them as constitutes the parts of an oak; and such an\norganization of those parts as is fit to receive and distribute\nnourishment, so as to continue and frame the wood, bark, and leaves,\n&c., of an oak, in which consists the vegetable life. That being then\none plant which has such an organization of parts in one coherent body,\npartaking of one common life, it continues to be the same plant as long\nas it partakes of the same life, though that life be communicated to\nnew particles of matter vitally united to the living plant, in a like\ncontinued organization conformable to that sort of plants. For this\norganization, being at any one instant in any one collection of matter,\nis in that particular concrete distinguished from all other, and IS\nthat individual life, which existing constantly from that moment both\nforwards and backwards, in the same continuity of insensibly succeeding\nparts united to the living body of the plant, it has that identity\nwhich makes the same plant, and all the parts of it, parts of the same\nplant, during all the time that they exist united in that continued\norganization, which is fit to convey that common life to all the parts\nso united.\n6. Identity of Animals.\nThe case is not so much different in BRUTES but that any one may hence\nsee what makes an animal and continues it the same. Something we have\nlike this in machines, and may serve to illustrate it. For example,\nwhat is a watch? It is plain it is nothing but a fit organization or\nconstruction of parts to a certain end, which, when a sufficient force\nis added to it, it is capable to attain. If we would suppose this\nmachine one continued body, all whose organized parts were repaired,\nincreased, or diminished by a constant addition or separation of\ninsensible parts, with one common life, we should have something very\nmuch like the body of an animal; with this difference, That, in an\nanimal the fitness of the organization, and the motion wherein life\nconsists, begin together, the motion coming from within; but in\nmachines the force coming sensibly from without, is often away when the\norgan is in order, and well fitted to receive it.\n7. The Identity of Man.\nThis also shows wherein the identity of the same MAN consists; viz. in\nnothing but a participation of the same continued life, by constantly\nfleeting particles of matter, in succession vitally united to the same\norganized body. He that shall place the identity of man in anything\nelse, but, like that of other animals, in one fitly organized body,\ntaken in any one instant, and from thence continued, under one\norganization of life, in several successively fleeting particles of\nmatter united to it, will find it hard to make an embryo, one of years,\nmad and sober, the SAME man, by any supposition, that will not make it\npossible for Seth, Ismael, Socrates, Pilate, St. Austin, and Caesar\nBorgia, to be the same man. For if the identity of SOUL ALONE makes the\nsame MAN; and there be nothing in the nature of matter why the same\nindividual spirit may not be united to different bodies, it will be\npossible that those men, living in distant ages, and of different\ntempers, may have been the same man: which way of speaking must be from\na very strange use of the word man, applied to an idea out of which\nbody and shape are excluded. And that way of speaking would agree yet\nworse with the notions of those philosophers who allow of\ntransmigration, and are of opinion that the souls of men may, for their\nmiscarriages, be detruded into the bodies of beasts, as fit\nhabitations, with organs suited to the satisfaction of their brutal\ninclinations. But yet I think nobody, could he be sure that the SOUL of\nHeliogabalus were in one of his hogs, would yet say that hog were a MAN\nor Heliogabalus.\n8. Idea of Identity suited to the Idea it is applied to.\nIt is not therefore unity of substance that comprehends all sorts of\nidentity, or will determine it in every case; but to conceive and judge\nof it aright, we must consider what idea the word it is applied to\nstands for: it being one thing to be the same SUBSTANCE, another the\nsame MAN, and a third the same PERSON, if PERSON, MAN, and SUBSTANCE,\nare three names standing for three different ideas;\u2014for such as is the\nidea belonging to that name, such must be the identity; which, if it\nhad been a little more carefully attended to, would possibly have\nprevented a great deal of that confusion which often occurs about this\nmatter, with no small seeming difficulties, especially concerning\nPERSONAL identity, which therefore we shall in the next place a little\nconsider.\n9. Same man.\nAn animal is a living organized body; and consequently the same animal,\nas we have observed, is the same continued LIFE communicated to\ndifferent particles of matter, as they happen successively to be united\nto that organized living body. And whatever is talked of other\ndefinitions, ingenious observation puts it past doubt, that the idea in\nour minds, of which the sound man in our mouths is the sign, is nothing\nelse but of an animal of such a certain form. Since I think I may be\nconfident, that, whoever should see a creature of his own shape or\nmake, though it had no more reason all its life than a cat or a parrot,\nwould call him still a MAN; or whoever should hear a cat or a parrot\ndiscourse, reason, and philosophize, would call or think it nothing but\na CAT or a PARROT; and say, the one was a dull irrational man, and the\nother a very intelligent rational parrot.\n10. Same man.\nFor I presume it is not the idea of a thinking or rational being alone\nthat makes the IDEA OF A MAN in most people\u2019s sense: but of a body, so\nand so shaped, joined to it; and if that be the idea of a man, the same\nsuccessive body not shifted all at once, must, as well as the same\nimmaterial spirit, go to the making of the same man.\n11. Personal Identity.\nThis being premised, to find wherein personal identity consists, we\nmust consider what PERSON stands for;\u2014which, I think, is a thinking\nintelligent being, that has reason and reflection, and can consider\nitself as itself, the same thinking thing, in different times and\nplaces; which it does only by that consciousness which is inseparable\nfrom thinking, and, as it seems to me, essential to it: it being\nimpossible for any one to perceive without PERCEIVING that he does\nperceive. When we see, hear, smell, taste, feel, meditate, or will\nanything, we know that we do so. Thus it is always as to our present\nsensations and perceptions: and by this every one is to himself that\nwhich he calls SELF:\u2014it not being considered, in this case, whether the\nsame self be continued in the same or divers substances. For, since\nconsciousness always accompanies thinking, and it is that which makes\nevery one to be what he calls self, and thereby distinguishes himself\nfrom all other thinking things, in this alone consists personal\nidentity, i.e. the sameness of a rational being: and as far as this\nconsciousness can be extended backwards to any past action or thought,\nso far reaches the identity of that person; it is the same self now it\nwas then; and it is by the same self with this present one that now\nreflects on it, that that action was done.\n12. Consciousness makes personal Identity.\nBut it is further inquired, whether it be the same identical substance.\nThis few would think they had reason to doubt of, if these perceptions,\nwith their consciousness, always remained present in the mind, whereby\nthe same thinking thing would be always consciously present, and, as\nwould be thought, evidently the same to itself. But that which seems to\nmake the difficulty is this, that this consciousness being interrupted\nalways by forgetfulness, there being no moment of our lives wherein we\nhave the whole train of all our past actions before our eyes in one\nview, but even the best memories losing the sight of one part whilst\nthey are viewing another; and we sometimes, and that the greatest part\nof our lives, not reflecting on our past selves, being intent on our\npresent thoughts, and in sound sleep having no thoughts at all, or at\nleast none with that consciousness which remarks our waking thoughts,\u2014I\nsay, in all these cases, our consciousness being interrupted, and we\nlosing the sight of our past selves, doubts are raised whether we are\nthe same thinking thing, i.e. the same SUBSTANCE or no. Which, however\nreasonable or unreasonable, concerns not PERSONAL identity at all. The\nquestion being what makes the same person; and not whether it be the\nsame identical substance, which always thinks in the same person,\nwhich, in this case, matters not at all: different substances, by the\nsame consciousness (where they do partake in it) being united into one\nperson, as well as different bodies by the same life are united into\none animal, whose identity is preserved in that change of substances by\nthe unity of one continued life. For, it being the same consciousness\nthat makes a man be himself to himself, personal identity depends on\nthat only, whether it be annexed solely to one individual substance, or\ncan be continued in a succession of several substances. For as far as\nany intelligent being CAN repeat the idea of any past action with the\nsame consciousness it had of it at first, and with the same\nconsciousness it has of any present action; so far it is the same\npersonal self. For it is by the consciousness it has of its present\nthoughts and actions, that it is SELF TO ITSELF now, and so will be the\nsame self, as far as the same consciousness can extend to actions past\nor to come; and would be by distance of time, or change of substance,\nno more two persons, than a man be two men by wearing other clothes\nto-day than he did yesterday, with a long or a short sleep between: the\nsame consciousness uniting those distant actions into the same person,\nwhatever substances contributed to their production.\n13. Personal Identity in Change of Substance.\nThat this is so, we have some kind of evidence in our very bodies, all\nwhose particles, whilst vitally united to this same thinking conscious\nself, so that WE FEEL when they are touched, and are affected by, and\nconscious of good or harm that happens to them, are a part of\nourselves; i.e. of our thinking conscious self. Thus, the limbs of his\nbody are to every one a part of himself; he sympathizes and is\nconcerned for them. Cut off a hand, and thereby separate it from that\nconsciousness he had of its heat, cold, and other affections, and it is\nthen no longer a part of that which is himself, any more than the\nremotest part of matter. Thus, we see the SUBSTANCE whereof personal\nself consisted at one time may be varied at another, without the change\nof personal identity; there being no question about the same person,\nthough the limbs which but now were a part of it, be cut off.\n14. Personality in Change of Substance.\nBut the question is, Whether if the same substance which thinks be\nchanged, it can be the same person; or, remaining the same, it can be\ndifferent persons?\nAnd to this I answer: First, This can be no question at all to those\nwho place thought in a purely material animal constitution, void of an\nimmaterial substance. For, whether their supposition be true or no, it\nis plain they conceive personal identity preserved in something else\nthan identity of substance; as animal identity is preserved in identity\nof life, and not of substance. And therefore those who place thinking\nin an immaterial substance only, before they can come to deal with\nthese men, must show why personal identity cannot be preserved in the\nchange of immaterial substances, or variety of particular immaterial\nsubstances, as well as animal identity is preserved in the change of\nmaterial substances, or variety of particular bodies: unless they will\nsay, it is one immaterial spirit that makes the same life in brutes, as\nit is one immaterial spirit that makes the same person in men; which\nthe Cartesians at least will not admit, for fear of making brutes\nthinking things too.\n15. Whether in Change of thinking Substances there can be one Person.\nBut next, as to the first part of the question, Whether, if the same\nthinking substance (supposing immaterial substances only to think) be\nchanged, it can be the same person? I answer, that cannot be resolved\nbut by those who know there can what kind of substances they are that\ndo think; and whether the consciousness of past actions can be\ntransferred from one thinking substance to another. I grant were the\nsame consciousness the same individual action it could not: but it\nbeing a present representation of a past action, why it may not be\npossible, that that may be represented to the mind to have been which\nreally never was, will remain to be shown. And therefore how far the\nconsciousness of past actions is annexed to any individual agent, so\nthat another cannot possibly have it, will be hard for us to determine,\ntill we know what kind of action it is that cannot be done without a\nreflex act of perception accompanying it, and how performed by thinking\nsubstances, who cannot think without being conscious of it. But that\nwhich we call the same consciousness, not being the same individual\nact, why one intellectual substance may not have represented to it, as\ndone by itself, what IT never did, and was perhaps done by some other\nagent\u2014why, I say, such a representation may not possibly be without\nreality of matter of fact, as well as several representations in dreams\nare, which yet whilst dreaming we take for true\u2014will be difficult to\nconclude from the nature of things. And that it never is so, will by\nus, till we have clearer views of the nature of thinking substances, be\nbest resolved into the goodness of God; who, as far as the happiness or\nmisery of any of his sensible creatures is concerned in it, will not,\nby a fatal error of theirs, transfer from one to another that\nconsciousness which draws reward or punishment with it. How far this\nmay be an argument against those who would place thinking in a system\nof fleeting animal spirits, I leave to be considered. But yet, to\nreturn to the question before us, it must be allowed, that, if the same\nconsciousness (which, as has been shown, is quite a different thing\nfrom the same numerical figure or motion in body) can be transferred\nfrom one thinking substance to another, it will be possible that two\nthinking substances may make but one person. For the same consciousness\nbeing preserved, whether in the same or different substances, the\npersonal identity is preserved.\n16. Whether, the same immaterial Substance remaining, there can be two\nPersons.\nAs to the second part of the question, Whether the same immaterial\nsubstance remaining, there may be two distinct persons; which question\nseems to me to be built on this,\u2014Whether the same immaterial being,\nbeing conscious of the action of its past duration, may be wholly\nstripped of all the consciousness of its past existence, and lose it\nbeyond the power of ever retrieving it again: and so as it were\nbeginning a new account from a new period, have a consciousness that\nCANNOT reach beyond this new state. All those who hold pre-existence\nare evidently of this mind; since they allow the soul to have no\nremaining consciousness of what it did in that pre-existent state,\neither wholly separate from body, or informing any other body; and if\nthey should not, it is plain experience would be against them. So that\npersonal identity, reaching no further than consciousness reaches, a\npre-existent spirit not having continued so many ages in a state of\nsilence, must needs make different persons. Suppose a Christian\nPlatonist or a Pythagorean should, upon God\u2019s having ended all his\nworks of creation the seventh day, think his soul hath existed ever\nsince; and should imagine it has revolved in several human bodies; as I\nonce met with one, who was persuaded his had been the SOUL of Socrates\n(how reasonably I will not dispute; this I know, that in the post he\nfilled, which was no inconsiderable one, he passed for a very rational\nman, and the press has shown that he wanted not parts or\nlearning;)\u2014would any one say, that he, being not conscious of any of\nSocrates\u2019s actions or thoughts, could be the same PERSON with Socrates?\nLet any one reflect upon himself, and conclude that he has in himself\nan immaterial spirit, which is that which thinks in him, and, in the\nconstant change of his body keeps him the same: and is that which he\ncalls HIMSELF: let him also suppose it to be the same soul that was in\nNestor or Thersites, at the siege of Troy, (for souls being, as far as\nwe know anything of them, in their nature indifferent to any parcel of\nmatter, the supposition has no apparent absurdity in it,) which it may\nhave been, as well as it is now the soul of any other man: but he now\nhaving no consciousness of any of the actions either of Nestor or\nThersites, does or can he conceive himself the same person with either\nof them? Can he be concerned in either of their actions? attribute them\nto himself, or think them his own more than the actions of any other\nmen that ever existed? So that this consciousness, not reaching to any\nof the actions of either of those men, he is no more one SELF with\neither of them than of the soul of immaterial spirit that now informs\nhim had been created, and began to exist, when it began to inform his\npresent body; though it were never so true, that the same SPIRIT that\ninformed Nestor\u2019s or Thersites\u2019 body were numerically the same that now\ninforms his. For this would no more make him the same person with\nNestor, than if some of the particles of smaller that were once a part\nof Nestor were now a part of this man the same immaterial substance,\nwithout the same consciousness, no more making the same person, by\nbeing united to any body, than the same particle of matter, without\nconsciousness, united to any body, makes the same person. But let him\nonce find himself conscious of any of the actions of Nestor, he then\nfinds himself the same person with Nestor.\n17. The body, as well as the soul, goes to the making of a Man.\nAnd thus may we be able, without any difficulty, to conceive the same\nperson at the resurrection, though in a body not exactly in make or\nparts the same which he had here,\u2014the same consciousness going along\nwith the soul that inhabits it. But yet the soul alone, in the change\nof bodies, would scarce to any one but to him that makes the soul the\nman, be enough to make the same man. For should the soul of a prince,\ncarrying with it the consciousness of the prince\u2019s past life, enter and\ninform the body of a cobbler, as soon as deserted by his own soul,\nevery one sees he would be the same PERSON with the prince, accountable\nonly for the prince\u2019s actions: but who would say it was the same MAN?\nThe body too goes to the making the man, and would, I guess, to\neverybody determine the man in this case, wherein the soul, with all\nits princely thoughts about it, would not make another man: but he\nwould be the same cobbler to every one besides himself. I know that, in\nthe ordinary way of speaking, the same person, and the same man, stand\nfor one and the same thing. And indeed every one will always have a\nliberty to speak as he pleases, and to apply what articulate sounds to\nwhat ideas he thinks fit, and change them as often as he pleases. But\nyet, when we will inquire what makes the same SPIRIT, MAN, or PERSON,\nwe must fix the ideas of spirit, man, or person in our minds; and\nhaving resolved with ourselves what we mean by them, it will not be\nhard to determine, in either of them, or the like, when it is the same,\nand when not.\n18. Consciousness alone unites actions into the same Person.\nBut though the same immaterial substance or soul does not alone,\nwherever it be, and in whatsoever state, make the same MAN; yet it is\nplain, consciousness, as far as ever it can be extended\u2014should it be to\nages past\u2014unites existences and actions very remote in time into the\nsame PERSON, as well as it does the existences and actions of the\nimmediately preceding moment: so that whatever has the consciousness of\npresent and past actions, is the same person to whom they both belong.\nHad I the same consciousness that I saw the ark and Noah\u2019s flood, as\nthat I saw an overflowing of the Thames last winter, or as that I write\nnow, I could no more doubt that I who write this now, that saw the\nThames overflowed last winter, and that viewed the flood at the general\ndeluge, was the same SELF,\u2014place that self in what SUBSTANCE you\nplease\u2014than that I who write this am the same MYSELF now whilst I write\n(whether I consist of all the same substance material or immaterial, or\nno) that I was yesterday. For as to this point of being the same self,\nit matters not whether this present self be made up of the same or\nother substances\u2014I being as much concerned, and as justly accountable\nfor any action that was done a thousand years since, appropriated to me\nnow by this self-consciousness, as I am for what I did the last moment.\n19. Self depends on Consciousness, not on Substance.\nSELF is that conscious thinking thing,\u2014whatever substance made up of,\n(whether spiritual or material, simple or compounded, it matters\nnot)\u2014which is sensible or conscious of pleasure and pain, capable of\nhappiness or misery, and so is concerned for itself, as far as that\nconsciousness extends. Thus every one finds that, whilst comprehended\nunder that consciousness, the little finger is as much a part of\nhimself as what is most so. Upon separation of this little finger,\nshould this consciousness go along with the little finger, and leave\nthe rest of the body, it is evident the little finger would be the\nperson, the same person; and self then would have nothing to do with\nthe rest of the body. As in this case it is the consciousness that goes\nalong with the substance, when one part is separate from another, which\nmakes the same person, and constitutes this inseparable self: so it is\nin reference to substances remote in time. That with which the\nconsciousness of this present thinking thing CAN join itself, makes the\nsame person, and is one self with it, and with nothing else; and so\nattributes to itself, and owns all the actions of that thing, as its\nown, as far as that consciousness reaches, and no further; as every one\nwho reflects will perceive.\n20. Persons, not Substances, the Objects of Reward and Punishment.\nIn this personal identity is founded all the right and justice of\nreward and punishment; happiness and misery being that for which every\none is concerned for HIMSELF, and not mattering what becomes of any\nSUBSTANCE, not joined to, or affected with that consciousness. For, as\nit is evident in the instance I gave but now, if the consciousness went\nalong with the little finger when it was cut off, that would be the\nsame self which was concerned for the whole body yesterday, as making\npart of itself, whose actions then it cannot but admit as its own now.\nThough, if the same body should still live, and immediately from the\nseparation of the little finger have its own peculiar consciousness,\nwhereof the little finger knew nothing, it would not at all be\nconcerned for it, as a part of itself, or could own any of its actions,\nor have any of them imputed to him.\n21. Which shows wherein Personal identity consists.\nThis may show us wherein personal identity consists: not in the\nidentity of substance, but, as I have said, in the identity of\nconsciousness, wherein if Socrates and the present mayor of\nQueenborough agree, they are the same person: if the same Socrates\nwaking and sleeping do not partake of the same consciousness, Socrates\nwaking and sleeping is not the same person. And to punish Socrates\nwaking for what sleeping Socrates thought, and waking Socrates was\nnever conscious of, would be no more of right, than to punish one twin\nfor what his brother-twin did, whereof he knew nothing, because their\noutsides were so like, that they could not be distinguished; for such\ntwins have been seen.\n22. Absolute oblivion separates what is thus forgotten from the person,\nbut not from the man.\nBut yet possibly it will still be objected,\u2014Suppose I wholly lose the\nmemory of some parts of my life, beyond a possibility of retrieving\nthem, so that perhaps I shall never be conscious of them again; yet am\nI not the same person that did those actions, had those thoughts that I\nonce was conscious of, though I have now forgot them? To which I\nanswer, that we must here take notice what the word _I_ is applied to;\nwhich, in this case, is the MAN only. And the same man being presumed\nto be the same person, I is easily here supposed to stand also for the\nsame person. But if it be possible for the same man to have distinct\nincommunicable consciousness at different times, it is past doubt the\nsame man would at different times make different persons; which, we\nsee, is the sense of mankind in the solemnest declaration of their\nopinions, human laws not punishing the mad man for the sober man\u2019s\nactions, nor the sober man for what the mad man did,\u2014thereby making\nthem two persons: which is somewhat explained by our way of speaking in\nEnglish when we say such an one is \u2018not himself,\u2019 or is \u2018beside\nhimself\u2019; in which phrases it is insinuated, as if those who now, or at\nleast first used them, thought that self was changed; the selfsame\nperson was no longer in that man.\n23. Difference between Identity of Man and of Person.\nBut yet it is hard to conceive that Socrates, the same individual man,\nshould be two persons. To help us a little in this, we must consider\nwhat is meant by Socrates, or the same individual MAN.\nFirst, it must be either the same individual, immaterial, thinking\nsubstance; in short, the same numerical soul, and nothing else.\nSecondly, or the same animal, without any regard to an immaterial soul.\nThirdly, or the same immaterial spirit united to the same animal.\nNow, take which of these suppositions you please, it is impossible to\nmake personal identity to consist in anything but consciousness; or\nreach any further than that does.\nFor, by the first of them, it must be allowed possible that a man born\nof different women, and in distant times, may be the same man. A way of\nspeaking which, whoever admits, must allow it possible for the same man\nto be two distinct persons, as any two that have lived in different\nages without the knowledge of one another\u2019s thoughts.\nBy the second and third, Socrates, in this life and after it, cannot be\nthe same man any way, but by the same consciousness; and so making\nhuman identity to consist in the same thing wherein we place personal\nidentity, there will be difficulty to allow the same man to be the same\nperson. But then they who place human identity in consciousness only,\nand not in something else, must consider how they will make the infant\nSocrates the same man with Socrates after the resurrection. But\nwhatsoever to some men makes a man, and consequently the same\nindividual man, wherein perhaps few are agreed, personal identity can\nby us be placed in nothing but consciousness, (which is that alone\nwhich makes what we call SELF,) without involving us in great\nabsurdities.\n24.\nBut is not a man drunk and sober the same person? why else is he\npunished for the fact he commits when drunk, though he be never\nafterwards conscious of it? Just as much the same person as a man that\nwalks, and does other things in his sleep, is the same person, and is\nanswerable for any mischief he shall do in it. Human laws punish both,\nwith a justice suitable to THEIR way of knowledge;\u2014because, in these\ncases, they cannot distinguish certainly what is real, what\ncounterfeit: and so the ignorance in drunkenness or sleep is not\nadmitted as a plea. But in the Great Day, wherein the secrets of all\nhearts shall be laid open, it may be reasonable to think, no one shall\nbe made to answer for what he knows nothing of; but shall receive his\ndoom, his conscience accusing or excusing him.\n25. Consciousness alone unites remote existences into one Person.\nNothing but consciousness can unite remote existences into the same\nperson: the identity of substance will not do it; for whatever\nsubstance there is, however framed, without consciousness there is no\nperson: and a carcass may be a person, as well as any sort of substance\nbe so, without consciousness.\nCould we suppose two distinct incommunicable consciousnesses acting the\nsame body, the one constantly by day, the other by night; and, on the\nother side, the same consciousness, acting by intervals, two distinct\nbodies: I ask, in the first case, whether the day and the night\u2014man\nwould not be two as distinct persons as Socrates and Plato? And\nwhether, in the second case, there would not be one person in two\ndistinct bodies, as much as one man is the same in two distinct\nclothings? Nor is it at all material to say, that this same, and this\ndistinct consciousness, in the cases above mentioned, is owing to the\nsame and distinct immaterial substances, bringing it with them to those\nbodies; which, whether true or no, alters not the case: since it is\nevident the personal identity would equally be determined by the\nconsciousness, whether that consciousness were annexed to some\nindividual immaterial substance or no. For, granting that the thinking\nsubstance in man must be necessarily supposed immaterial, it is evident\nthat immaterial thinking thing may sometimes part with its past\nconsciousness, and be restored to it again: as appears in the\nforgetfulness men often have of their past actions; and the mind many\ntimes recovers the memory of a past consciousness, which it had lost\nfor twenty years together. Make these intervals of memory and\nforgetfulness to take their turns regularly by day and night, and you\nhave two persons with the same immaterial spirit, as much as in the\nformer instance two persons with the same body. So that self is not\ndetermined by identity or diversity of substance, which it cannot be\nsure of, but only by identity of consciousness.\n26. Not the substance with which the consciousness may be united.\nIndeed it may conceive the substance whereof it is now made up to have\nexisted formerly, united in the same conscious being: but,\nconsciousness removed, that substance is no more itself, or makes no\nmore a part of it, than any other substance; as is evident in the\ninstance we have already given of a limb cut off, of whose heat, or\ncold, or other affections, having no longer any consciousness, it is no\nmore of a man\u2019s self than any other matter of the universe. In like\nmanner it will be in reference to any immaterial substance, which is\nvoid of that consciousness whereby I am myself to myself: so that I\ncannot upon recollection join with that present consciousness whereby I\nam now myself, it is, in that part of its existence, no more MYSELF\nthan any other immaterial being. For, whatsoever any substance has\nthought or done, which I cannot recollect, and by my consciousness make\nmy own thought and action, it will no more belong to me, whether a part\nof me thought or did it, than if it had been thought or done by any\nother immaterial being anywhere existing.\n27. Consciousness unites substances, material or spiritual, with the\nsame personality.\nI agree, the more probable opinion is, that this consciousness is\nannexed to, and the affection of, one individual immaterial substance.\nBut let men, according to their diverse hypotheses, resolve of that as\nthey please. This every intelligent being, sensible of happiness or\nmisery, must grant\u2014that there is something that is HIMSELF, that he is\nconcerned for, and would have happy; that this self has existed in a\ncontinued duration more than one instant, and therefore it is possible\nmay exist, as it has done, months and years to come, without any\ncertain bounds to be set to its duration; and may be the same self, by\nthe same consciousness continued on for the future. And thus, by this\nconsciousness he finds himself to be the same self which did such and\nsuch an action some years since, by which he comes to be happy or\nmiserable now. In all which account of self, the same numerical\nSUBSTANCE is not considered a making the same self; but the same\ncontinued CONSCIOUSNESS, in which several substances may have been\nunited, and again separated from it, which, whilst they continued in a\nvital union with that wherein this consciousness then resided, made a\npart of that same self. Thus any part of our bodies, vitally united to\nthat which is conscious in us, makes a part of ourselves: but upon\nseparation from the vital union by which that consciousness is\ncommunicated, that which a moment since was part of ourselves, is now\nno more so than a part of another man\u2019s self is a part of me: and it is\nnot impossible but in a little time may become a real part of another\nperson. And so we have the same numerical substance become a part of\ntwo different persons; and the same person preserved under the change\nof various substances. Could we suppose any spirit wholly stripped of\nall its memory of consciousness of past actions, as we find our minds\nalways are of a great part of ours, and sometimes of them all; the\nunion or separation of such a spiritual substance would make no\nvariation of personal identity, any more than that of any particle of\nmatter does. Any substance vitally united to the present thinking being\nis a part of that very same self which now is; anything united to it by\na consciousness of former actions, makes also a part of the same self,\nwhich is the same both then and now.\n28. Person a forensic Term.\nPERSON, as I take it, is the name for this self. Wherever a man finds\nwhat he calls himself, there, I think, another may say is the same\nperson. It is a forensic term, appropriating actions and their merit;\nand so belongs only to intelligent agents, capable of a law, and\nhappiness, and misery. This personality extends itself beyond present\nexistence to what is past, only by consciousness,\u2014whereby it becomes\nconcerned and accountable; owns and imputes to itself past actions,\njust upon the same ground and for the same reason as it does the\npresent. All which is founded in a concern for happiness, the\nunavoidable concomitant of consciousness; that which is conscious of\npleasure and pain, desiring that that self that is conscious should be\nhappy. And therefore whatever past actions it cannot reconcile or\nAPPROPRIATE to that present self by consciousness, it can be no more\nconcerned in than if they had never been done: and to receive pleasure\nor pain, i.e. reward or punishment, on the account of any such action,\nis all one as to be made happy or miserable in its first being, without\nany demerit at all. For, supposing a MAN punished now for what he had\ndone in another life, whereof he could be made to have no consciousness\nat all, what difference is there between that punishment and being\nCREATED miserable? And therefore, conformable to this, the apostle\ntells us, that, at the great day, when every one shall \u2018receive\naccording to his doings, the secrets of all hearts shall be laid open.\u2019\nThe sentence shall be justified by the consciousness all persons shall\nhave, that THEY THEMSELVES, in what bodies soever they appear, or what\nsubstances soever that consciousness adheres to, are the SAME that\ncommitted those actions, and deserve that punishment for them.\n29. Suppositions that look strange are pardonable in our ignorance.\nI am apt enough to think I have, in treating of this subject, made some\nsuppositions that will look strange to some readers, and possibly they\nare so in themselves. But yet, I think they are such as are pardonable,\nin this ignorance we are in of the nature of that thinking thing that\nis in us, and which we look on as OURSELVES. Did we know what it was;\nor how it was tied to a certain system of fleeting animal spirits; or\nwhether it could or could not perform its operations of thinking and\nmemory out of a body organized as ours is; and whether it has pleased\nGod that no one such spirit shall ever be united to any but one such\nbody, upon the right constitution of whose organs its memory should\ndepend; we might see the absurdity of some of those suppositions I have\nmade. But taking, as we ordinarily now do (in the dark concerning these\nmatters,) the soul of a man for an immaterial substance, independent\nfrom matter, and indifferent alike to it all; there can, from the\nnature of things, be no absurdity at all to suppose that the same SOUL\nmay at different times be united to different BODIES, and with them\nmake up for that time one MAN: as well as we suppose a part of a\nsheep\u2019s body yesterday should be a part of a man\u2019s body to-morrow, and\nin that union make a vital part of Meliboeus himself, as well as it did\nof his ram.\n30. The Difficulty from ill Use of Names.\nTo conclude: Whatever substance begins to exist, it must, during its\nexistence, necessarily be the same: whatever compositions of substances\nbegin to exist, during the union of those substances, the concrete must\nbe the same: whatsoever mode begins to exist, during its existence it\nis the same: and so if the composition be of distinct substances and\ndifferent modes, the same rule holds. Whereby it will appear, that the\ndifficulty or obscurity that has been about this matter rather rises\nfrom the names ill-used, than from any obscurity in things themselves.\nFor whatever makes the specific idea to which the name is applied, if\nthat idea be steadily kept to, the distinction of anything into the\nsame and divers will easily be conceived, and there can arise no doubt\nabout it.\n31. Continuance of that which we have made to be our complex idea of\nman makes the same man.\nFor, supposing a rational spirit be the idea of a MAN, it is easy to\nknow what is the same man, viz. the same spirit\u2014whether separate or in\na body\u2014will be the SAME MAN. Supposing a rational spirit vitally united\nto a body of a certain conformation of parts to make a man; whilst that\nrational spirit, with that vital conformation of parts, though\ncontinued in a fleeting successive body, remains, it will be the SAME\nMAN. But if to any one the idea of a man be but the vital union of\nparts in a certain shape; as long as that vital union and shape remain\nin a concrete, no otherwise the same but by a continued succession of\nfleeting particles, it will be the SAME MAN. For, whatever be the\ncomposition whereof the complex idea is made, whenever existence makes\nit one particular thing under any denomination, THE SAME EXISTENCE\nCONTINUED preserves it the SAME individual under the same denomination.\nCHAPTER XXVIII.\nOF OTHER RELATIONS.\n1. Ideas of Proportional relations.\nBESIDES the before-mentioned occasions of time, place, and causality of\ncomparing or referring things one to another, there are, as I have\nsaid, infinite others, some whereof I shall mention.\nFirst, The first I shall name is some one simple idea, which, being\ncapable of parts or degrees, affords an occasion of comparing the\nsubjects wherein it is to one another, in respect of that simple idea,\nv.g. whiter, sweeter, equal, more, &c. These relations depending on the\nequality and excess of the same simple idea, in several subjects, may\nbe called, if one will, PROPORTIONAL; and that these are only\nconversant about those simple ideas received from sensation or\nreflection is so evident that nothing need be said to evince it.\n2. Natural relation.\nSecondly, Another occasion of comparing things together, or considering\none thing, so as to include in that consideration some other thing, is\nthe circumstances of their origin or beginning; which being not\nafterwards to be altered, make the relations depending thereon as\nlasting as the subjects to which they belong, v.g. father and son,\nbrothers, cousin-germans, &c., which have their relations by one\ncommunity of blood, wherein they partake in several degrees:\ncountrymen, i.e. those who were born in the same country or tract of\nground; and these I call NATURAL RELATIONS: wherein we may observe,\nthat mankind have fitted their notions and words to the use of common\nlife, and not to the truth and extent of things. For it is certain,\nthat, in reality, the relation is the same betwixt the begetter and the\nbegotten, in the several races of other animals as well as men; but yet\nit is seldom said, this bull is the grandfather of such a calf, or that\ntwo pigeons are cousin-germans. It is very convenient that, by distinct\nnames, these relations should be observed and marked out in mankind,\nthere being occasion, both in laws and other communications one with\nanother, to mention and take notice of men under these relations: from\nwhence also arise the obligations of several duties amongst men:\nwhereas, in brutes, men having very little or no cause to mind these\nrelations, they have not thought fit to give them distinct and peculiar\nnames. This, by the way, may give us some light into the different\nstate and growth of languages; which being suited only to the\nconvenience of communication, are proportioned to the notions men have,\nand the commerce of thoughts familiar amongst them; and not to the\nreality or extent of things, nor to the various respects might be found\namong them; nor the different abstract considerations might be framed\nabout them. Where they had no philosophical notions, there they had no\nterms to express them: and it is no wonder men should have framed no\nnames for those things they found no occasion to discourse of. From\nwhence it is easy to imagine why, as in some countries, they may have\nnot so much as the name for a horse; and in others, where they are more\ncareful of the pedigrees of their horses, than of their own, that there\nthey may have not only names for particular horses, but also of their\nseveral relations of kindred one to another.\n3. Ideas of Instituted or Voluntary relations.\nThirdly, Sometimes the foundation of considering things with reference\nto one another, is some act whereby any one comes by a moral right,\npower, or obligation to do something. Thus, a general is one that hath\npower to command an army, and an army under a general is a collection\nof armed men obliged to obey one man. A citizen, or a burgher, is one\nwho has a right to certain privileges in this or that place. All this\nsort depending upon men\u2019s wills, or agreement in society, I call\nINSTITUTED, or VOLUNTARY; and may be distinguished from the natural, in\nthat they are most, if not all of them, some way or other alterable,\nand separable from the persons to whom they have sometimes belonged,\nthough neither of the substances, so related, be destroyed. Now, though\nthese are all reciprocal, as well as the rest, and contain in them a\nreference of two things one to the other; yet, because one of the two\nthings often wants a relative name, importing that reference, men\nusually take no notice of it, and the relation is commonly overlooked:\nv. g. a patron and client are easily allowed to be relations, but a\nconstable or dictator are not so readily at first hearing considered as\nsuch. Because there is no peculiar name for those who are under the\ncommand of a dictator or constable, expressing a relation to either of\nthem; though it be certain that either of them hath a certain power\nover some others, and so is so far related to them, as well as a patron\nis to his client, or general to his army.\n4. Ideas of Moral relations.\nFourthly, There is another sort of relation, which is the conformity or\ndisagreement men\u2019s VOLUNTARY ACTIONS have to a RULE to which they are\nreferred, and by which they are judged of; which, I think, may be\ncalled MORAL RELATION, as being that which denominates our moral\nactions, and deserves well to be examined; there being no part of\nknowledge wherein we should be more careful to get determined ideas,\nand avoid, as much as may be, obscurity and confusion. Human actions,\nwhen with their various ends, objects, manners, and circumstances, they\nare framed into distinct complex ideas, are, as has been shown, so many\nMIXED MODES, a great part whereof have names annexed to them. Thus,\nsupposing gratitude to be a readiness to acknowledge and return\nkindness received; polygamy to be the having more wives than one at\nonce: when we frame these notions thus in our minds, we have there so\nmany determined ideas of mixed modes. But this is not all that concerns\nour actions: it is not enough to have determined ideas of them, and to\nknow what names belong to such and such combinations of ideas. We have\na further and greater concernment, and that is, to know whether such\nactions, so made up, are morally good or bad.\n5. Moral Good and Evil.\nGood and evil, as hath been shown, (B. II. chap. xx. Section 2, and\nchap. xxi. Section 43,) are nothing but pleasure or pain, or that which\noccasions or procures pleasure or pain to us. MORAL GOOD AND EVIL,\nthen, is only THE CONFORMITY OR DISAGREEMENT OF OUR VOLUNTARY ACTIONS\nTO SOME LAW, WHEREBY GOOD OR EVIL IS DRAWN ON US, FROM THE WILL AND\nPOWER OF THE LAW-MAKER; which good and evil, pleasure or pain,\nattending our observance or breach of the law by the decree of the\nlaw-maker, is that we call REWARD and PUNISHMENT.\n6. Moral Rules.\nOf these moral rules or laws, to which men generally refer, and by\nwhich they judge of the rectitude or gravity of their actions, there\nseem to me to be THREE SORTS, with their three different enforcements,\nor rewards and punishments. For, since it would be utterly in vain to\nsuppose a rule set to the free actions of men, without annexing to it\nsome enforcement of good and evil to determine his will, we must,\nwherever we suppose a law, suppose also some reward or punishment\nannexed to that law. It would be in vain for one intelligent being to\nset a rule to the actions of another, if he had it not in his power to\nreward the compliance with, and punish deviation from his rule, by some\ngood and evil, that is not the natural product and consequence of the\naction itself. For that, being a natural convenience or inconvenience,\nwould operate of itself, without a law. This, if I mistake not, is the\ntrue nature of all law, properly so called.\n7. Laws.\nThe laws that men generally refer their actions to, to judge of their\nrectitude or obliquity, seem to me to be these three:\u20141. The DIVINE\nlaw. 2. The CIVIL law. 3. The law of OPINION or REPUTATION, if I may so\ncall it. By the relation they bear to the first of these, men judge\nwhether their actions are sins or duties; by the second, whether they\nbe criminal or innocent; and by the third, whether they be virtues or\nvices.\n8. Divine Law the Measure of Sin and Duty.\nFirst, the DIVINE LAW, whereby that law which God has set to the\nactions of men,\u2014whether promulgated to them by the light of nature, or\nthe voice of revelation. That God has given a rule whereby men should\ngovern themselves, I think there is nobody so brutish as to deny. He\nhas a right to do it; we are his creatures: he has goodness and wisdom\nto direct our actions to that which is best: and he has power to\nenforce it by rewards and punishments of infinite weight and duration\nin another life; for nobody can take us out of his hands. This is the\nonly true touchstone of moral rectitude; and, by comparing them to this\nlaw, it is that men judge of the most considerable moral good or evil\nof their actions; that is, whether, as duties or sins, they are like to\nprocure them happiness or misery from the hands of the ALMIGHTY.\n9. Civil Law the Measure of Crimes and Innocence.\nSecondly, the CIVIL LAW\u2014the rule set by the commonwealth to the actions\nof those who belong to it\u2014is another rule to which men refer their\nactions; to judge whether they be criminal or no. This law nobody\noverlooks: the rewards and punishments that enforce it being ready at\nhand, and suitable to the power that makes it: which is the force of\nthe Commonwealth, engaged to protect the lives, liberties, and\npossessions of those who live according to its laws, and has power to\ntake away life, liberty, or goods, from him who disobeys; which is the\npunishment of offences committed against his law.\n10. Philosophical Law the Measure of Virtue and Vice.\nThirdly, the LAW OF OPINION OR REPUTATION. Virtue and vice are names\npretended and supposed everywhere to stand for actions in their own\nnature right and wrong: and as far as they really are so applied, they\nso far are coincident with the divine law above mentioned. But yet,\nwhatever is pretended, this is visible, that these names, virtue and\nvice, in the particular instances of their application, through the\nseveral nations and societies of men in the world, are constantly\nattributed only to such actions as in each country and society are in\nreputation or discredit. Nor is it to be thought strange, that men\neverywhere should give the name of virtue to those actions, which\namongst them are judged praiseworthy; and call that vice, which they\naccount blamable: since otherwise they would condemn themselves, if\nthey should think anything right, to which they allowed not\ncommendation, anything wrong, which they let pass without blame. Thus\nthe measure of what is everywhere called and esteemed virtue and vice\nis this approbation or dislike, praise or blame, which, by a secret and\ntacit consent, establishes itself in the several societies, tribes, and\nclubs of men in the world: whereby several actions come to find credit\nor disgrace amongst them, according to the judgment, maxims, or fashion\nof that place. For, though men uniting into politic societies, have\nresigned up to the public the disposing of all their force, so that\nthey cannot employ it against any fellow-citizens any further than the\nlaw of the country directs: yet they retain still the power of thinking\nwell or ill, approving or disapproving of the actions of those whom\nthey live amongst, and converse with: and by this approbation and\ndislike they establish amongst themselves what they will call virtue\nand vice.\n11. The Measure that Man commonly apply to determine what they call\nVirtue and Vice.\nThat this is the common MEASURE of virtue and vice, will appear to any\none who considers, that, though that passes for vice in one country\nwhich is counted a virtue, or at least not vice, in another, yet\neverywhere virtue and praise, vice and blame, go together. Virtue is\neverywhere, that which is thought praiseworthy; and nothing else but\nthat which has the allowance of public esteem is called virtue. Virtue\nand praise are so united, that they are called often by the same name.\nSunt sua praemia laudi, says Virgil; and so Cicero, Nihil habet natura\npraestantius, quam honestatem, quam laudem, quam dignitatem, quam\ndecus, which he tells you are all names for the same thing. This is the\nlanguage of the heathen philosophers, who well understood wherein their\nnotions of virtue and vice consisted. And though perhaps, by the\ndifferent temper, education, fashion, maxims, or interest of different\nsorts of men, it fell out, that what was thought praiseworthy in one\nplace, escaped not censure in another; and so in different societies,\nvirtues and vices were changed; yet, as to the main, they for the most\npart kept the same everywhere. For, since nothing can be more natural\nthan to encourage with esteem and reputation that wherein every one\nfinds his advantage, and to blame and discountenance the contrary; it\nis no wonder that esteem and discredit, virtue and vice, should, in a\ngreat measure, everywhere correspond with the unchangeable rule of\nright and wrong, which the law of God hath established; there being\nnothing that so directly and visibly secures and advances the general\ngood of mankind in this world, as obedience to the laws he had set\nthem, and nothing that breeds such mischiefs and confusion, as the\nneglect of them. And therefore men, without renouncing all sense and\nreason, and their own interest, which they are so constantly true to,\ncould not generally mistake, in placing their commendation and blame on\nthat side that really deserved it not. Nay, even those men whose\npractice was otherwise, failed not to give their approbation right, few\nbeing depraved to that degree as not to condemn, at least in others,\nthe faults they themselves were guilty of; whereby, even in the\ncorruption of manners, the true boundaries of the law of nature, which\nought to be the rule of virtue and vice, were pretty well preferred. So\nthat even the exhortations of inspired teachers, have not feared to\nappeal to common repute: \u2018Whatsoever is lovely, whatsoever is of good\nreport, if there be any virtue, if there be any praise,\u2019 &c. (Phil. iv.\n8.)\n12. Its Inforcement is Commendation and Discredit.\nIf any one shall imagine that I have forgot my own notion of a law,\nwhen I make the law, whereby men judge of virtue and vice, to be\nnothing else but the consent of private men, who have not authority\nenough to make a law: especially wanting that which is so necessary and\nessential to a law, a power to enforce it: I think I may say, that he\nwho imagines commendation and disgrace not to be strong motives to men\nto accommodate themselves to the opinions and rules of those with whom\nthey converse, seems little skilled in the nature or history of\nmankind: the greatest part whereof we shall find to govern themselves\nchiefly, if not solely, by this LAW OF FASHION; and so they do that\nwhich keeps them in reputation with their company, little regard the\nlaws of God, or the magistrate. The penalties that attend the breach of\nGod\u2019s laws some, nay perhaps most men, seldom seriously reflect on: and\namongst those that do, many, whilst they break the law, entertain\nthoughts of future reconciliation, and making their peace for such\nbreaches. And as to the punishments due from the laws of the\ncommonwealth, they frequently flatter themselves with the hopes of\nimpunity. But no man escapes the punishment of their censure and\ndislike, who offends against the fashion and opinion of the company he\nkeeps, and would recommend himself to. Nor is there one of ten\nthousand, who is stiff and insensible enough, to bear up under the\nconstant dislike and condemnation of his own club. He must be of a\nstrange and unusual constitution, who can content himself to live in\nconstant disgrace and disrepute with his own particular society.\nSolitude many men have sought, and been reconciled to: but nobody that\nhas the least thought or sense of a man about him, can live in society\nunder the constant dislike and ill opinion of his familiars, and those\nhe converses with. This is a burden too heavy for human sufferance: and\nhe must be made up of irreconcileable contradictions, who can take\npleasure in company, and yet be insensible of contempt and disgrace\nfrom his companions.\n13. These three Laws the Rules of moral Good and Evil.\nThese three then, first, the law of God; secondly, the law of politic\nsocieties; thirdly, the law of fashion, or private censure, are those\nto which men variously compare their actions: and it is by their\nconformity to one of these laws that they take their measures, when\nthey would judge of their moral rectitude, and denominate their actions\ngood or bad.\n14. Morality is the Relation of Voluntary Actions to these Rules.\nWhether the rule to which, as to a touchstone, we bring our voluntary\nactions, to examine them by, and try their goodness, and accordingly to\nname them, which is, as it were, the mark of the value we set upon\nthem: whether, I say, we take that rule from the fashion of the\ncountry, or the will of a law-maker, the mind is easily able to observe\nthe relation any action hath to it, and to judge whether the action\nagrees or disagrees with the rule; and so hath a notion of moral\ngoodness or evil, which is either conformity or not conformity of any\naction to that rule: and therefore is often called moral rectitude.\nThis rule being nothing but a collection of several simple ideas, the\nconformity thereto is but so ordering the action, that the simple ideas\nbelonging to it may correspond to those which the law requires. And\nthus we see how moral beings and notions are founded on, and terminated\nin, these simple ideas we have received from sensation or reflection.\nFor example: let us consider the complex idea we signify by the word\nmurder: and when we have taken it asunder, and examined all the\nparticulars, we shall find them to amount to a collection of simple\nideas derived from reflection or sensation, viz. First, from REFLECTION\non the operations of our own minds, we have the ideas of willing,\nconsidering, purposing beforehand, malice, or wishing ill to another;\nand also of life, or perception, and self-motion. Secondly, from\nSENSATION we have the collection of those simple sensible ideas which\nare to be found in a man, and of some action, whereby we put an end to\nperception and motion in the man; all which simple ideas are\ncomprehended in the word murder. This collection of simple ideas, being\nfound by me to agree or disagree with the esteem of the country I have\nbeen bred in, and to be held by most men there worthy praise or blame,\nI call the action virtuous or vicious: if I have the will of a supreme\ninvisible Lawgiver for my rule, then, as I supposed the action\ncommanded or forbidden by God, I call it good or evil, sin or duty: and\nif I compare it to the civil law, the rule made by the legislative\npower of the country, I call it lawful or unlawful, a crime or no\ncrime. So that whencesoever we take the rule of moral actions; or by\nwhat standard soever we frame in our minds the ideas of virtues or\nvices, they consist only, and are made up of collections of simple\nideas, which we originally received from sense or reflection: and their\nrectitude or obliquity consists in the agreement or disagreement with\nthose patterns prescribed by some law.\n15. Moral actions may be regarded either absolutely, or as ideas of\nrelation.\nTo conceive rightly of moral actions, we must take notice of them under\nthis two-fold consideration. First, as they are in themselves, each\nmade up of such a collection of simple ideas. Thus drunkenness, or\nlying, signify such or such a collection of simple ideas, which I call\nmixed modes: and in this sense they are as much POSITIVE ABSOLUTE\nideas, as the drinking of a horse, or speaking of a parrot. Secondly,\nour actions are considered as good, bad, or indifferent; and in this\nrespect they are RELATIVE, it being their conformity to, or\ndisagreement with some rule that makes them to be regular or irregular,\ngood or bad; and so, as far as they are compared with a rule, and\nthereupon denominated, they come under relation. Thus the challenging\nand fighting with a man, as it is a certain positive mode, or\nparticular sort of action, by particular ideas, distinguished from all\nothers, is called DUELLING: which, when considered in relation to the\nlaw of God, will deserve the name of sin; to the law of fashion, in\nsome countries, valour and virtue; and to the municipal laws of some\ngovernments, a capital crime. In this case, when the positive mode has\none name, and another name as it stands in relation to the law, the\ndistinction may as easily be observed as it is in substances, where one\nname, v.g. MAN, is used to signify the thing; another, v.g. FATHER, to\nsignify the relation.\n16. The Denominations of Actions often mislead us.\nBut because very frequently the positive idea of the action, and its\nmoral relation, are comprehended together under one name, and the same\nword made use of to express both the mode or action, and its moral\nrectitude or obliquity: therefore the relation itself is less taken\nnotice of; and there is often no distinction made between the positive\nidea of the action, and the reference it has to a rule. By which\nconfusion of these two distinct considerations under one term, those\nwho yield too easily to the impressions of sounds, and are forward to\ntake names for things, are often misled in their judgment of actions.\nThus, the taking from another what is his, without his knowledge or\nallowance, is properly called STEALING: but that name, being commonly\nunderstood to signify also the moral gravity of the action, and to\ndenote its contrariety to the law, men are apt to condemn whatever they\nhear called stealing, as an ill action, disagreeing with the rule of\nright. And yet the private taking away his sword from a madman, to\nprevent his doing mischief, though it be properly denominated stealing,\nas the name of such a mixed mode; yet when compared to the law of God,\nand considered in its relation to that supreme rule, it is no sin or\ntransgression, though the name stealing ordinarily carries such an\nintimation with it.\n17. Relations innumerable, and only the most considerable here\nmentioned.\nAnd thus much for the relation of human actions to a law, which,\ntherefore, I call MORAL RELATIONS.\nIt would make a volume to go over all sorts of RELATIONS: it is not,\ntherefore, to be expected that I should here mention them all. It\nsuffices to our present purpose to show by these, what the ideas are we\nhave of this comprehensive consideration called RELATION. Which is so\nvarious, and the occasions of it so many, (as many as there can be of\ncomparing things one to another,) that it is not very easy to reduce it\nto rules, or under just heads. Those I have mentioned, I think, are\nsome of the most considerable; and such as may serve to let us see from\nwhence we get our ideas of relations, and wherein they are founded. But\nbefore I quit this argument, from what has been said give me leave to\nobserve:\n18. All Relations terminate in simple Ideas.\nFirst, That it is evident, that all relation terminates in, and is\nultimately founded on, those simple ideas we have got from sensation or\nreflection: so that all we have in our thoughts ourselves, (if we think\nof anything, or have any meaning,) or would signify to others, when we\nuse words standing for relations, is nothing but some simple ideas, or\ncollections of simple ideas, compared one with another. This is so\nmanifest in that sort called proportional, that nothing can be more.\nFor when a man says \u2018honey is sweeter than wax,\u2019 it is plain that his\nthoughts in this relation terminate in this simple idea, sweetness;\nwhich is equally true of all the rest: though, where they are\ncompounded, or decompounded, the simple ideas they are made up of, are,\nperhaps, seldom taken notice of: v.g. when the word father is\nmentioned: first, there is meant that particular species, or collective\nidea, signified by the word man; secondly, those sensible simple ideas,\nsignified by the word generation; and, thirdly, the effects of it, and\nall the simple ideas signified by the word child. So the word friend,\nbeing taken for a man who loves and is ready to do good to another, has\nall these following ideas to the making of it up: first, all the simple\nideas, comprehended in the word man, or intelligent being; secondly,\nthe idea of love; thirdly, the idea of readiness or disposition;\nfourthly, the idea of action, which is any kind of thought or motion;\nfifthly, the idea of good, which signifies anything that may advance\nhis happiness, and terminates at last, if examined, in particular\nsimple ideas, of which the word good in general signifies any one; but,\nif removed from all simple ideas quite, it signifies nothing at all.\nAnd thus also all moral words terminate at last, though perhaps more\nremotely, in a collection of simple ideas: the immediate signification\nof relative words, being very often other supposed known relations;\nwhich, if traced one to another, still end in simple ideas.\n19. We have ordinarily as clear a Notion of the Relation, as of the\nsimple ideas in things on which it is founded.\nSecondly, That in relations, we have for the most part, if not always,\nas clear a notion of THE RELATION as we have of THOSE SIMPLE IDEAS\nWHEREIN IT IS FOUNDED: agreement or disagreement, whereon relation\ndepends, being things whereof we have commonly as clear ideas as of any\nother whatsoever; it being but the distinguishing simple ideas, or\ntheir degrees one from another, without which we could have no distinct\nknowledge at all. For, if I have a clear idea of sweetness, light, or\nextension, I have, too, of equal, or more, or less, of each of these:\nif I know what it is for one man to be born of a woman, viz. Sempronia,\nI know what it is for another man to be born of the same woman\nSempronia; and so have as clear a notion of brothers as of births, and\nperhaps clearer. For if I believed that Sempronia digged Titus out of\nthe parsley-bed, (as they used to tell children,) and thereby became\nhis mother; and that afterwards, in the same manner, she digged Caius\nout of the parsley-bed, I had as clear a notion of the relation of\nbrothers between them, as if I had all the skill of a midwife: the\nnotion that the same woman contributed, as mother, equally to their\nbirths, (though I were ignorant or mistaken in the manner of it,) being\nthat on which I grounded the relation; and that they agreed in the\ncircumstance of birth, let it be what it will. The comparing them then\nin their descent from the same person, without knowing the particular\ncircumstances of that descent, is enough to found my notion of their\nhaving, or not having, the relation of brothers. But though the ideas\nof PARTICULAR RELATIONS are capable of being as clear and distinct in\nthe minds of those who will duly consider them as those of mixed modes,\nand more determinate than those of substances: yet the names belonging\nto relation are often of as doubtful and uncertain signification as\nthose of substances or mixed modes; and much more than those of simple\nideas. Because relative words, being the marks of this comparison,\nwhich is made only by men\u2019s thoughts, and is an idea only in men\u2019s\nminds, men frequently apply them to different comparisons of things,\naccording to their own imaginations; which do not always correspond\nwith those of others using the same name.\n20. The Notion of Relation is the same, whether the Rule any Action is\ncompared to be true or false.\nThirdly, That in these I call MORAL RELATIONS, I have a true notion of\nrelation, by comparing the action with the rule, whether the rule be\ntrue or false. For if I measure anything by a yard, I know whether the\nthing I measure be longer or shorter than that supposed yard, though\nperhaps the yard I measure by be not exactly the standard: which indeed\nis another inquiry. For though the rule be erroneous, and I mistaken in\nit; yet the agreement or disagreement observable in that which I\ncompare with, makes me perceive the relation. Though, measuring by a\nwrong rule, I shall thereby be brought to judge amiss of its moral\nrectitude; because I have tried it by that which is not the true rule:\nyet I am not mistaken in the relation which that action bears to that\nrule I compare it to, which is agreement or disagreement.\nCHAPTER XXIX.\nOF CLEAR AND OBSCURE, DISTINCT AND CONFUSED IDEAS.\n1. Ideas, some clear and distinct, others obscure and confused.\nHaving shown the original of our ideas, and taken a view of their\nseveral sorts; considered the difference between the simple and the\ncomplex; and observed how the complex ones are divided into those of\nmodes, substances, and relations\u2014all which, I think, is necessary to be\ndone by any one who would acquaint himself thoroughly with the progress\nof the mind, in its apprehension and knowledge of things\u2014it will,\nperhaps, be thought I have dwelt long enough upon the examination of\nIDEAS. I must, nevertheless, crave leave to offer some few other\nconsiderations concerning them.\nThe first is, that some are CLEAR and others OBSCURE; some DISTINCT and\nothers CONFUSED.\n2. Clear and obscure explained by Sight.\nThe perception of the mind being most aptly explained by words relating\nto the sight, we shall best understand what is meant by CLEAR and\nOBSCURE in our ideas, by reflecting on what we call clear and obscure\nin the objects of sight. Light being that which discovers to us visible\nobjects, we give the name of OBSCURE to that which is not placed in a\nlight sufficient to discover minutely to us the figure and colours\nwhich are observable in it, and which, in a better light, would be\ndiscernible. In like manner, our simple ideas are CLEAR, when they are\nsuch as the objects themselves from whence they were taken did or\nmight, in a well-ordered sensation or perception, present them. Whilst\nthe memory retains them thus, and can produce them to the mind whenever\nit has occasion to consider them, they are clear ideas. So far as they\neither want anything of the original exactness, or have lost any of\ntheir first freshness, and are, as it were, faded or tarnished by time,\nso far are they obscure. Complex ideas, as they are made up of simple\nones, so they are clear, when the ideas that go to their composition\nare clear, and the number and order of those simple ideas that are the\ningredients of any complex one is determinate and certain.\n3. Causes of Obscurity.\nThe causes of obscurity, in simple ideas, seem to be either dull\norgans; or very slight and transient impressions made by the objects;\nor else a weakness in the memory, not able to retain them as received.\nFor to return again to visible objects, to help us to apprehend this\nmatter. If the organs, or faculties of perception, like wax\nover-hardened with cold, will not receive the impression of the seal,\nfrom the usual impulse wont to imprint it; or, like wax of a temper too\nsoft, will not hold it well, when well imprinted; or else supposing the\nwax of a temper fit, but the seal not applied with a sufficient force\nto make a clear impression: in any of these cases, the print left by\nthe seal will be obscure. This, I suppose, needs no application to make\nit plainer.\n4. Distinct and confused, what.\nAs a clear idea is that whereof the mind has such a full and evident\nperception, as it does receive from an outward object operating duly on\na well-disposed organ, so a DISTINCT idea is that wherein the mind\nperceives a difference from all other; and a CONFUSED idea is such an\none as is not sufficiently distinguishable from another, from which it\nought to be different.\n5. Objection.\nIf no idea be confused, but such as is not sufficiently distinguishable\nfrom another from which it should be different, it will be hard, may\nany one say, to find anywhere a CONFUSED idea. For, let any idea be as\nit will, it can be no other but such as the mind perceives it to be;\nand that very perception sufficiently distinguishes it from all other\nideas, which cannot be other, i.e. different, without being perceived\nto be so. No idea, therefore, can be undistinguishable from another\nfrom which it ought to be different, unless you would have it different\nfrom itself: for from all other it is evidently different.\n6. Confusion of Ideas is in Reference to their Names.\nTo remove this difficulty, and to help us to conceive aright what it is\nthat makes the confusion ideas are at any time chargeable with, we must\nconsider, that things ranked under distinct names are supposed\ndifferent enough to be distinguished, that so each sort by its peculiar\nname may be marked, and discoursed of apart upon any occasion: and\nthere is nothing more evident, than that the greatest part of different\nnames are supposed to stand for different things. Now every idea a man\nhas, being visibly what it is, and distinct from all other ideas but\nitself; that which makes it confused, is, when it is such that it may\nas well be called by another name as that which it is expressed by; the\ndifference which keeps the things (to be ranked under those two\ndifferent names) distinct, and makes some of them belong rather to the\none and some of them to the other of those names, being left out; and\nso the distinction, which was intended to be kept up by those different\nnames, is quite lost.\n7. Defaults which make this Confusion.\nThe defaults which usually occasion this confusion, I think, are\nchiefly these following:\nFirst, complex ideas made up of too few simple ones.\nFirst, when any complex idea (for it is complex ideas that are most\nliable to confusion) is made up of too small a number of simple ideas,\nand such only as are common to other things, whereby the differences\nthat make it deserve a different name, are left out. Thus, he that has\nan idea made up of barely the simple ones of a beast with spots, has\nbut a confused idea of a leopard; it not being thereby sufficiently\ndistinguished from a lynx, and several other sorts of beasts that are\nspotted. So that such an idea, though it hath the peculiar name\nleopard, is not distinguishable from those designed by the names lynx\nor panther, and may as well come under the name lynx as leopard. How\nmuch the custom of defining of words by general terms contributes to\nmake the ideas we would express by them confused and undetermined, I\nleave others to consider. This is evident, that confused ideas are such\nas render the use of words uncertain, and take away the benefit of\ndistinct names. When the ideas, for which we use different terms, have\nnot a difference answerable to their distinct names, and so cannot be\ndistinguished by them, there it is that they are truly confused.\n8. Secondly, or their simple ones jumbled disorderly together.\nSecondly, Another fault which makes our ideas confused is, when, though\nthe particulars that make up any idea are in number enough, yet they\nare so jumbled together, that it is not easily discernible whether it\nmore belongs to the name that is given it than to any other. There is\nnothing properer to make us conceive this confusion than a sort of\npictures, usually shown as surprising pieces of art, wherein the\ncolours, as they are laid by the pencil on the table itself, mark out\nvery odd and unusual figures, and have no discernible order in their\nposition. This draught, thus made up of parts wherein no symmetry nor\norder appears, is in itself no more a confused thing, than the picture\nof a cloudy sky; wherein, though there be as little order of colours or\nfigures to be found, yet nobody thinks it a confused picture. What is\nit, then, that makes it be thought confused, since the want of symmetry\ndoes not? As it is plain it does not: for another draught made barely\nin imitation of this could not be called confused. I answer, That which\nmakes it be thought confused is, the applying it to some name to which\nit does no more discernibly belong than to some other: v.g. when it is\nsaid to be the picture of a man, or Caesar, then any one with reason\ncounts it confused; because it is not discernible in that state to\nbelong more to the name man, or Caesar, than to the name baboon, or\nPompey: which are supposed to stand for different ideas from those\nsignified by man, or Caesar. But when a cylindrical mirror, placed\nright, had reduced those irregular lines on the table into their due\norder and proportion, then the confusion ceases, and the eye presently\nsees that it is a man, or Caesar; i.e. that it belongs to those names;\nand that it is sufficiently distinguishable from a baboon, or Pompey;\ni.e. from the ideas signified by those names. Just thus it is with our\nideas, which are as it were the pictures of things. No one of these\nmental draughts, however the parts are put together, can be called\nconfused (for they are plainly discernible as they are) till it be\nranked under some ordinary name to which it cannot be discerned to\nbelong, any more than it does to some other name of an allowed\ndifferent signification.\n9. Thirdly, or their simple ones mutable and undetermined.\nThirdly, A third defect that frequently gives the name of confused to\nour ideas, is, when any one of them is uncertain and undetermined. Thus\nwe may observe men who, not forbearing to use the ordinary words of\ntheir language till they have learned their precise signification,\nchange the idea they make this or that term stand for, almost as often\nas they use it. He that does this out of uncertainty of what he should\nleave out, or put into his idea of CHURCH, or IDOLATRY, every time he\nthinks of either, and holds not steady to any one precise combination\nof ideas that makes it up, is said to have a confused idea of idolatry\nor the church: though this be still for the same reason as the former,\nviz. because a mutable idea (if we will allow it to be one idea) cannot\nbelong to one name rather than another, and so loses the distinction\nthat distinct names are designed for.\n10. Confusion without Reference to Names, hardly conceivable.\nBy what has been said, we may observe how much NAMES, as supposed\nsteady signs of things, and by their difference to stand for, and keep\nthings distinct that in themselves are different, are the occasion of\ndenominating ideas distinct or confused, by a secret and unobserved\nreference the mind makes of its ideas to such names. This perhaps will\nbe fuller understood, after what I say of Words in the third Book has\nbeen read and considered. But without taking notice of such a reference\nof ideas to distinct names, as the signs of distinct things, it will be\nhard to say what a confused idea is. And therefore when a man designs,\nby any name, a sort of things, or any one particular thing, distinct\nfrom all others, the complex idea he annexes to that name is the more\ndistinct, the more particular the ideas are, and the greater and more\ndeterminate the number and order of them is, whereof it is made up.\nFor, the more it has of these, the more it has still of the perceivable\ndifferences, whereby it is kept separate and distinct from all ideas\nbelonging to other names, even those that approach nearest to it, and\nthereby all confusion with them is avoided.\n11. Confusion concerns always two Ideas.\nConfusion making it a difficulty to separate two things that should be\nseparated, concerns always two ideas; and those most which most\napproach one another. Whenever, therefore, we suspect any idea to be\nconfused, we must examine what other it is in danger to be confounded\nwith, or which it cannot easily be separated from; and that will always\nbe found an idea belonging to another name, and so should be a\ndifferent thing, from which yet it is not sufficiently distinct: being\neither the same with it, or making a part of it, or at least as\nproperly called by that name as the other it is ranked under; and so\nkeeps not that difference from that other idea which the different\nnames import.\n12. Causes of confused Ideas.\nThis, I think, is the confusion proper to ideas; which still carries\nwith it a secret reference to names. At least, if there be any other\nconfusion of ideas, this is that which most of all disorders men\u2019s\nthoughts and discourses: ideas, as ranked under names, being those that\nfor the most part men reason of within themselves, and always those\nwhich they commune about with others. And therefore where there are\nsupposed two different ideas, marked by two different names, which are\nnot as distinguishable as the sounds that stand for them, there never\nfails to be confusion; and where any ideas are distinct as the ideas of\nthose two sounds they are marked by, there can be between them no\nconfusion. The way to prevent it is to collect and unite into one\ncomplex idea, as precisely as is possible, all those ingredients\nwhereby it is differenced from others; and to them, so united in a\ndeterminate number and order, apply steadily the same name. But this\nneither accommodating men\u2019s ease or vanity, nor serving any design but\nthat of naked truth, which is not always the thing aimed at, such\nexactness is rather to be wished than hoped for. And since the loose\napplication of names, to undetermined, variable, and almost no ideas,\nserves both to cover our own ignorance, as well as to perplex and\nconfound others, which goes for learning and superiority in knowledge,\nit is no wonder that most men should use it themselves, whilst they\ncomplain of it in others. Though I think no small part of the confusion\nto be found in the notions of men might, by care and ingenuity, be\navoided, yet I am far from concluding it everywhere wilful. Some ideas\nare so complex, and made up of so many parts, that the memory does not\neasily retain the very same precise combination of simple ideas under\none name: much less are we able constantly to divine for what precise\ncomplex idea such a name stands in another man\u2019s use of it. From the\nfirst of these, follows confusion in a man\u2019s own reasonings and\nopinions within himself; from the latter, frequent confusion in\ndiscoursing and arguing with others. But having more at large treated\nof Words, their defects, and abuses, in the following Book, I shall\nhere say no more of it.\n13. Complex Ideas may be distinct in one Part, and confused in another.\nOur complex ideas, being made up of collections, and so variety of\nsimple ones, may accordingly be very clear and distinct in one part,\nand very obscure and confused in another. In a man who speaks of a\nchiliaedron, or a body of a thousand sides, the ideas of the figure may\nbe very confused, though that of the number be very distinct; so that\nhe being able to discourse and demonstrate concerning that part of his\ncomplex idea which depends upon the number of thousand, he is apt to\nthink he has a distinct idea of a chiliaedron; though it be plain he\nhas no precise idea of its figure, so as to distinguish it, by that,\nfrom one that has but 999 sides: the not observing whereof causes no\nsmall error in men\u2019s thoughts, and confusion in their discourses.\n14. This, if not heeded, causes Confusion in our Arguings.\nHe that thinks he has a distinct idea of the figure of a chiliaedron,\nlet him for trial sake take another parcel of the same uniform matter,\nviz. gold or wax of an equal bulk, and make it into a figure of 999\nsides. He will, I doubt not, be able to distinguish these two ideas one\nfrom another, by the number of sides; and reason and argue distinctly\nabout them, whilst he keeps his thoughts and reasoning to that part\nonly of these ideas which is contained in their numbers; as that the\nsides of the one could be divided into two equal numbers, and of the\nothers not, &c. But when he goes about to distinguish them by their\nfigure, he will there be presently at a loss, and not be able, I think,\nto frame in his mind two ideas, one of them distinct from the other, by\nthe bare figure of these two pieces of gold; as he could, if the same\nparcels of gold were made one into a cube, the other a figure of five\nsides. In which incomplete ideas, we are very apt to impose on\nourselves, and wrangle with others, especially where they have\nparticular and familiar names. For, being satisfied in that part of the\nidea which we have clear; and the name which is familiar to us, being\napplied to the whole, containing that part also which is imperfect and\nobscure, we are apt to use it for that confused part, and draw\ndeductions from it in the obscure part of its signification, as\nconfidently as we do from the other.\n15. Instance in Eternity.\nHaving frequently in our mouths the name Eternity, we are apt to think\nwe have a positive comprehensive idea of it, which is as much as to\nsay, that there is no part of that duration which is not clearly\ncontained in our idea. It is true that he that thinks so may have a\nclear idea of duration; he may also have a clear idea of a very great\nlength of duration; he may also have a clear idea of the comparison of\nthat great one with still a greater: but it not being possible for him\nto include in his idea of any duration, let it be as great as it will,\nthe WHOLE EXTENT TOGETHER OF A DURATION, WHERE HE SUPPOSES NO END, that\npart of his idea, which is still beyond the bounds of that large\nduration he represents to his own thoughts, is very obscure and\nundetermined. And hence it is that in disputes and reasonings\nconcerning eternity, or any other infinite, we are very apt to blunder,\nand involve ourselves in manifest absurdities.\n16. Infinite Divisibility of Matter.\nIn matter, we have no clear ideas of the smallness of parts much beyond\nthe smallest that occur to any of our senses: and therefore, when we\ntalk of the divisibility of matter IN INFINITUM, though we have clear\nideas of division and divisibility, and have also clear ideas of parts\nmade out of a whole by division; yet we have but very obscure and\nconfused ideas of corpuscles, or minute bodies, so to be divided, when,\nby former divisions, they are reduced to a smallness much exceeding the\nperception of any of our senses; and so all that we have clear and\ndistinct ideas of is of what division in general or abstractedly is,\nand the relation of TOTUM and PARS: but of the bulk of the body, to be\nthus infinitely divided after certain progressions, I think, we have no\nclear nor distinct idea at all. For I ask any one, whether, taking the\nsmallest atom of dust he ever saw, he has any distinct idea (bating\nstill the number, which concerns not extension) betwixt the 100,000th\nand the 1,000,000th part of it. Or if he think he can refine his ideas\nto that degree, without losing sight of them, let him add ten cyphers\nto each of those numbers. Such a degree of smallness is not\nunreasonable to be supposed; since a division carried on so far brings\nit no nearer the end of infinite division, than the first division into\ntwo halves does. I must confess, for my part, I have no clear distinct\nideas of the different bulk or extension of those bodies, having but a\nvery obscure one of either of them. So that, I think, when we talk of\ndivision of bodies in infinitum, our idea of their distinct bulks,\nwhich is the subject and foundation of division, comes, after a little\nprogression, to be confounded, and almost lost in obscurity. For that\nidea which is to represent only bigness must be very obscure and\nconfused, which we cannot distinguish from one ten times as big, but\nonly by number: so that we have clear distinct ideas, we may say, of\nten and one, but no distinct ideas of two such extensions. It is plain\nfrom hence, that, when we talk of infinite divisibility of body or\nextension, our distinct and clear ideas are only of numbers: but the\nclear distinct ideas of extension, after some progress of division, are\nquite lost; and of such minute parts we have no distinct ideas at all;\nbut it returns, as all our ideas of infinite do, at last to that of\nNUMBER ALWAYS TO BE ADDED; but thereby never amounts to any distinct\nidea of ACTUAL INFINITE PARTS. We have, it is true, a clear idea of\ndivision, as often as we think of it; but thereby we have no more a\nclear idea of infinite parts in matter, than we have a clear idea of an\ninfinite number, by being able still to add new numbers to any assigned\nnumbers we have: endless divisibility giving us no more a clear and\ndistinct idea of actually infinite parts, than endless addibility (if I\nmay so speak) gives us a clear and distinct idea of an actually\ninfinite number: they both being only in a power still of increasing\nthe number, be it already as great as it will. So that of what remains\nto be added (WHEREIN CONSISTS THE INFINITY) we have but an obscure,\nimperfect, and confused idea; from or about which we can argue or\nreason with no certainty or clearness, no more than we can in\narithmetic, about a number of which we have no such distinct idea as we\nhave of 4 or 100; but only this relative obscure one, that, compared to\nany other, it is still bigger: and we have no more a clear positive\nidea of it, when we [dropped line*] than if we should say it is bigger\nthan 40 or 4: 400,000,000 having no nearer a proportion to the end of\naddition or number than 4. For he that adds only 4 to 4, and so\nproceeds, shall as soon come to the end of all addition, as he that\nadds 400,000,000 to 400,000,000. And so likewise in eternity; he that\nhas an idea of but four years, has as much a positive complete idea of\neternity, as he that has one of 400,000,000 of years: for what remains\nof eternity beyond either of these two numbers of years, is as clear to\nthe one as the other; i.e. neither of them has any clear positive idea\nof it at all. For he that adds only 4 years to 4, and so on, shall as\nsoon reach eternity as he that adds 400,000,000 of years, and so on;\nor, if he please, doubles the increase as often as he will: the\nremaining abyss being still as far beyond the end of all these\nprogressions as it is from the length of a day or an hour. For nothing\nfinite bears any proportion to infinite; and therefore our ideas, which\nare all finite, cannot bear any. Thus it is also in our idea of\nextension, when we increase it by addition, as well as when we diminish\nit by division, and would enlarge our thoughts to infinite space. After\na few doublings of those ideas of extension, which are the largest we\nare accustomed to have, we lose the clear distinct idea of that space:\nit becomes a confusedly great one, with a surplus of still greater;\nabout which, when we would argue or reason, we shall always find\nourselves at a loss; confused ideas, in our arguings and deductions\nfrom that part of them which is confused, always leading us into\nconfusion.\nCHAPTER XXX.\nOF REAL AND FANTASTICAL IDEAS.\n1. Ideas considered in reference to their Archetypes.\nBesides what we have already mentioned concerning ideas, other\nconsiderations belong to them, in reference to THINGS FROM WHENCE THEY\nARE TAKEN, or WHICH THEY MAY BE SUPPOSED TO REPRESENT; and thus, I\nthink, they may come under a threefold distinction, and are:\u2014First,\neither real or fantastical; Secondly, adequate or inadequate; Thirdly,\ntrue or false.\nFirst, by REAL IDEAS, I mean such as have a foundation in nature; such\nas have a conformity with the real being and existence of things, or\nwith their archetypes. FANTASTICAL or CHIMERICAL, I call such as have\nno foundation in nature, nor have any conformity with that reality of\nbeing to which they are tacitly referred, as to their archetypes. If we\nexamine the several sorts of ideas before mentioned, we shall find\nthat,\n2. Simple Ideas are all real appearances of things.\nFirst, Our SIMPLE IDEAS are all real, all agree to the reality of\nthings: not that they are all of them the images or representations of\nwhat does exist; the contrary whereof, in all but the primary qualities\nof bodies, hath been already shown. But, though whiteness and coldness\nare no more in snow than pain is; yet those ideas of whiteness and\ncoldness, pain, &c., being in us the effects of powers in things\nwithout us, ordained by our Maker to produce in us such sensations;\nthey are real ideas in us, whereby we distinguish the qualities that\nare really in things themselves. For, these several appearances being\ndesigned to be the mark whereby we are to know and distinguish things\nwhich we have to do with, our ideas do as well serve us to that\npurpose, and are as real distinguishing characters, whether they be\nonly CONSTANT EFFECTS, or else EXACT RESEMBLANCES of something in the\nthings themselves: the reality lying in that steady correspondence they\nhave with the distinct constitutions of real beings. But whether they\nanswer to those constitutions, as to causes or patterns, it matters\nnot; it suffices that they are constantly produced by them. And thus\nour simple ideas are all real and true, because they answer and agree\nto those powers of things which produce them on our minds; that being\nall that is requisite to make them real, and not fictions at pleasure.\nFor in simple ideas (as has been shown) the mind is wholly confined to\nthe operation of things upon it, and can make to itself no simple idea,\nmore than what it was received.\n3. Complex Ideas are voluntary Combinations.\nThough the mind be wholly passive in respect of its simple ideas; yet,\nI think, we may say it is not so in respect of its complex ideas. For\nthose being combinations of simple ideas put together, and united under\none general name, it is plain that the mind of man uses some kind of\nliberty in forming those complex ideas: how else comes it to pass that\none man\u2019s idea of gold, or justice, is different from another\u2019s, but\nbecause he has put in, or left out of his, some simple idea which the\nother has not? The question then is, Which of these are real, and which\nbarely imaginary combinations? What collections agree to the reality of\nthings, and what not? And to this I say that,\n4. Mixed Modes and Relations, made of consistent Ideas, are real.\nSecondly, MIXED MODES and RELATIONS, having no other reality but what\nthey have in the minds of men, there is nothing more required to this\nkind of ideas to make them real, but that they be so framed, that there\nbe a possibility of existing conformable to them. These ideas\nthemselves, being archetypes, cannot differ from their archetypes, and\nso cannot be chimerical, unless any one will jumble together in them\ninconsistent ideas. Indeed, as any of them have the names of a known\nlanguage assigned to them, by which he that has them in his mind would\nsignify them to others, so bare possibility of existing is not enough;\nthey must have a conformity to the ordinary signification of the name\nthat is given them, that they may not be thought fantastical: as if a\nman would give the name of justice to that idea which common use calls\nliberality. But this fantasticalness relates more to propriety of\nspeech, than reality of ideas. For a man to be undisturbed in danger,\nsedately to consider what is fittest to be done, and to execute it\nsteadily, is a mixed mode, or a complex idea of an action which may\nexist. But to be undisturbed in danger, without using one\u2019s reason or\nindustry, is what is also possible to be; and so is as real an idea as\nthe other. Though the first of these, having the name COURAGE given to\nit, may, in respect of that name, be a right or wrong idea; but the\nother, whilst it has not a common received name of any known language\nassigned to it, is not capable of any deformity, being made with no\nreference to anything but itself.\n5. Complex Ideas of Substances are real, when they agree with the\nexistence of Things.\nThirdly, Our complex ideas of SUBSTANCES, being made all of them in\nreference to things existing without us, and intended to be\nrepresentations of substances as they really are, are no further real\nthan as they are such combinations of simple ideas as are really\nunited, and co-exist in things without us. On the contrary, those are\nfantastical which are made up of such collections of simple ideas as\nwere really never united, never were found together in any substance:\nv. g. a rational creature, consisting of a horse\u2019s head, joined to a\nbody of human shape, or such as the CENTAURS are described: or, a body\nyellow, very malleable, fusible, and fixed, but lighter than common\nwater: or an uniform, unorganized body, consisting, as to sense, all of\nsimilar parts, with perception and voluntary motion joined to it.\nWhether such substances as these can possibly exist or no, it is\nprobable we do not know: but be that as it will, these ideas of\nsubstances, being made conformable to no pattern existing that we know;\nand consisting of such collections of ideas as no substance ever showed\nus united together, they ought to pass with us for barely imaginary:\nbut much more are those complex ideas so, which contain in them any\ninconsistency or contradiction of their parts.\nCHAPTER XXXI.\nOF ADEQUATE AND INADEQUATE IDEAS.\n1. Adequate Ideas are such as perfectly represent their Archetypes.\nOf our real ideas, some are adequate, and some are inadequate. Those I\ncall ADEQUATE, which perfectly represent those archetypes which the\nmind supposes them taken from: which it intends them to stand for, and\nto which it refers them. INADEQUATE IDEAS are such, which are but a\npartial or incomplete representation of those archetypes to which they\nare referred. Upon which account it is plain,\n2. Adequate Ideas are such as perfectly represent their Archetypes.\nSimple Ideas all adequate.\nFirst, that ALL OUR SIMPLE IDEAS ARE ADEQUATE. Because, being nothing\nbut the effects of certain powers in things, fitted and ordained by God\nto produce such sensations in us, they cannot but be correspondent and\nadequate to those powers: and we are sure they agree to the reality of\nthings. For, if sugar produce in us the ideas which we call whiteness\nand sweetness, we are sure there is a power in sugar to produce those\nideas in our minds, or else they could not have been produced by it.\nAnd so each sensation answering the power that operates on any of our\nsenses, the idea so produced is a real idea, (and not a fiction of the\nmind, which has no power to produce any simple idea); and cannot but be\nadequate, since it ought only to answer that power: and so all simple\nideas are adequate. It is true, the things producing in us these simple\nideas are but few of them denominated by us, as if they were only the\nCAUSES of them; but as if those ideas were real beings IN them. For,\nthough fire be called painful to the touch, whereby is signified the\npower of producing in us the idea of pain, yet it is denominated also\nlight and hot; as if light and heat were really something in the fire,\nmore than a power to excite these ideas in us; and therefore are called\nqualities in or of the fire. But these being nothing, in truth, but\npowers to excite such ideas in us, I must in that sense be understood,\nwhen I speak of secondary qualities as being in things; or of their\nideas as being the objects that excite them in us. Such ways of\nspeaking, though accommodated to the vulgar notions, without which one\ncannot be well understood, yet truly signify nothing but those powers\nwhich are in things to excite certain sensations or ideas in us. Since\nwere there no fit organs to receive the impressions fire makes on the\nsight and touch, nor a mind joined to those organs to receive the ideas\nof light and heat by those impressions from the fire or sun, there\nwould yet be no more light or heat in the world than there would be\npain if there were no sensible creature to feel it, though the sun\nshould continue just as it is now, and Mount AEtna flame higher than\never it did. Solidity and extension, and the termination of it, figure,\nwith motion and rest, whereof we have the ideas, would be really in the\nworld as they are, whether there were any sensible being to perceive\nthem or no: and therefore we have reason to look on those as the real\nmodifications of matter, and such as are the exciting causes of all our\nvarious sensations from bodies. But this being an inquiry not belonging\nto this place, I shall enter no further into it, but proceed to show\nwhat complex ideas are adequate, and what not.\n3. Modes are all adequate.\nSecondly, OUR COMPLEX IDEAS OF MODES, being voluntary collections of\nsimple ideas, which the mind puts together, without reference to any\nreal archetypes, or standing patterns, existing anywhere, are and\ncannot but be ADEQUATE IDEAS. Because they, not being intended for\ncopies of things really existing, but for archetypes made by the mind,\nto rank and denominate things by, cannot want anything; they having\neach of them that combination of ideas, and thereby that perfection,\nwhich the mind intended they should: so that the mind acquiesces in\nthem, and can find nothing wanting. Thus, by having the idea of a\nfigure with three sides meeting at three angles, I have a complete\nidea, wherein I require nothing else to make it perfect. That the mind\nis satisfied with the perfection of this its idea is plain, in that it\ndoes not conceive that any understanding hath, or can have, a more\ncomplete or perfect idea of that thing it signifies by the word\ntriangle, supposing it to exist, than itself has, in that complex idea\nof three sides and three angles, in which is contained all that is or\ncan be essential to it, or necessary to complete it, wherever or\nhowever it exists. But in our IDEAS OF SUBSTANCES it is otherwise. For\nthere, desiring to copy things as they really do exist, and to\nrepresent to ourselves that constitution on which all their properties\ndepend, we perceive our ideas attain not that perfection we intend: we\nfind they still want something we should be glad were in them; and so\nare all inadequate. But MIXED MODES and RELATIONS, being archetypes\nwithout patterns, and so having nothing to represent but themselves,\ncannot but be adequate, everything being so to itself. He that at first\nput together the idea of danger perceived, absence of disorder from\nfear, sedate consideration of what was justly to be done, and executing\nthat without disturbance, or being deterred by the danger of it, had\ncertainly in his mind that complex idea made up of that combination:\nand intending it to be nothing else but what is, nor to have in it any\nother simple ideas but what it hath, it could not also but be an\nadequate idea: and laying this up in his memory, with the name COURAGE\nannexed to it, to signify to others, and denominate from thence any\naction he should observe to agree with it, had thereby a standard to\nmeasure and denominate actions by, as they agreed to it. This idea,\nthus made and laid up for a pattern, must necessarily be adequate,\nbeing referred to nothing else but itself, nor made by any other\noriginal but the good liking and will of him that first made this\ncombination.\n4. Modes, in reference to settled Names, may be inadequate.\nIndeed another coming after, and in conversation learning from him the\nword COURAGE, may make an idea, to which he gives the name courage,\ndifferent from what the first author applied it to, and has in his mind\nwhen he uses it. And in this case, if he designs that his idea in\nthinking should be conformable to the other\u2019s idea, as the name he uses\nin speaking is conformable in sound to his from whom he learned it, his\nidea may be very wrong and inadequate: because in this case, making the\nother man\u2019s idea the pattern of his idea in thinking, as the other\nman\u2019s word or sound is the pattern of his in speaking, his idea is so\nfar defective and inadequate, as it is distant from the archetype and\npattern he refers it to, and intends to express and signify by the name\nhe uses for it; which name he would have to be a sign of the other\nman\u2019s idea, (to which, in its proper use, it is primarily annexed,) and\nof his own, as agreeing to it: to which if his own does not exactly\ncorrespond, it is faulty and inadequate.\n5. Because then means, in propriety of speech, to correspond to the\nideas in some other mind.\nTherefore these complex ideas of MODES, which they are referred by the\nmind, and intended to correspond to the ideas in the mind of some other\nintelligent being, expressed by the names we apply to them, they may be\nvery deficient, wrong, and inadequate; because they agree not to that\nwhich the mind designs to be their archetype and pattern: in which\nrespect only any idea of modes can be wrong, imperfect, or inadequate.\nAnd on this account our ideas of mixed modes are the most liable to be\nfaulty of any other; but this refers more to proper speaking than\nknowing right.\n6. Ideas of Substances, as referred to real Essences, not adequate.\nThirdly, what IDEAS WE HAVE OF SUBSTANCES, I have above shown. Now,\nthose ideas have in the mind a double reference: 1. Sometimes they are\nreferred to a supposed real essence of each species of things. 2.\nSometimes they are only designed to be pictures and representations in\nthe mind of things that do exist, by ideas of those qualities that are\ndiscoverable in them. In both which ways these copies of those\noriginals and archetypes are imperfect and inadequate.\nFirst, it is usual for men to make the names of substances stand for\nthings as supposed to have certain real essences, whereby they are of\nthis or that species: and names standing for nothing but the ideas that\nare in men\u2019s minds, they must constantly refer their ideas to such real\nessences, as to their archetypes. That men (especially such as have\nbeen bred up in the learning taught in this part of the world) do\nsuppose certain specific essences of substances, which each individual\nin its several kinds is made conformable to and partakes of, is so far\nfrom needing proof that it will be thought strange if any one should do\notherwise. And thus they ordinarily apply the specific names they rank\nparticular substances under, to things as distinguished by such\nspecific real essences. Who is there almost, who would not take it\namiss if it should be doubted whether he called himself a man, with any\nother meaning than as having the real essence of a man? And yet if you\ndemand what those real essences are, it is plain men are ignorant, and\nknow them not. From whence it follows, that the ideas they have in\ntheir minds, being referred to real essences, as to archetypes which\nare unknown, must be so far from being adequate that they cannot be\nsupposed to be any representation of them at all. The complex ideas we\nhave of substances are, as it has been shown, certain collections of\nsimple ideas that have been observed or supposed constantly to exist\ntogether. But such a complex idea cannot be the real essence of any\nsubstance; for then the properties we discover in that body would\ndepend on that complex idea, and be deducible from it, and their\nnecessary connexion with it be known; as all properties of a triangle\ndepend on, and, as far as they are discoverable, are deducible from the\ncomplex idea of three lines including a space. But it is plain that in\nour complex ideas of substances are not contained such ideas, on which\nall the other qualities that are to be found in them do depend. The\ncommon idea men have of iron is, a body of a certain colour, weight,\nand hardness; and a property that they look on as belonging to it, is\nmalleableness. But yet this property has no necessary connexion with\nthat complex idea, or any part of it: and there is no more reason to\nthink that malleableness depends on that colour, weight, and hardness,\nthan that colour or that weight depends on its malleableness. And yet,\nthough we know nothing of these real essences, there is nothing more\nordinary than that men should attribute the sorts of things to such\nessences. The particular parcel of matter which makes the ring I have\non my finger is forwardly by most men supposed to have a real essence,\nwhereby it is gold; and from whence those qualities flow which I find\nin it, viz. its peculiar colour, weight, hardness, fusibility,\nfixedness, and change of colour upon a slight touch of mercury, &c.\nThis essence, from which all these properties flow, when I inquire into\nit and search after it, I plainly perceive I cannot discover: the\nfurthest I can go is, only to presume that, it being nothing but body,\nits real essence or internal constitution, on which these qualities\ndepend, can be nothing but the figure, size, and connexion of its solid\nparts; of neither of which having any distinct perception at all can I\nhave any idea of its essence: which is the cause that it has that\nparticular shining yellowness; a greater weight than anything I know of\nthe same bulk; and a fitness to have its colour changed by the touch of\nquicksilver. If any one will say, that the real essence and internal\nconstitution, on which these properties depend, is not the figure,\nsize, and arrangement or connexion of its solid parts, but something\nelse, called its particular FORM, I am further from having any idea of\nits real essence than I was before. For I have an idea of figure, size,\nand situation of solid parts in general, though I have none of the\nparticular figure, size, or putting together of parts, whereby the\nqualities above mentioned are produced; which qualities I find in that\nparticular parcel of matter that is on my finger, and not in another\nparcel of matter, with which I cut the pen I write with. But, when I am\ntold that something besides the figure, size, and posture of the solid\nparts of that body in its essence, something called SUBSTANTIAL FORM,\nof that I confess I have no idea at all, but only of the sound form;\nwhich is far enough from an idea of its real essence or constitution.\nThe like ignorance as I have of the real essence of this particular\nsubstance, I have also of the real essence of all other natural ones:\nof which essences I confess I have no distinct ideas at all; and, I am\napt to suppose, others, when they examine their own knowledge, will\nfind in themselves, in this one point, the same sort of ignorance.\n7. Because men know not the real essence of substances.\nNow, then, when men apply to this particular parcel of matter on my\nfinger a general name already in use, and denominate it GOLD, do they\nnot ordinarily, or are they not understood to give it that name, as\nbelonging to a particular species of bodies, having a real internal\nessence; by having of which essence this particular substance comes to\nbe of that species, and to be called by that name? If it be so, as it\nis plain it is, the name by which things are marked as having that\nessence must be referred primarily to that essence; and consequently\nthe idea to which that name is given must be referred also to that\nessence, and be intended to represent it. Which essence, since they who\nso use the names know not, their ideas of substances must be all\ninadequate in that respect, as not containing in them that real essence\nwhich the mind intends they should.\n8. Ideas of Substances, when regarded as Collections of their\nQualities, are all inadequate.\nSecondly, those who, neglecting that useless supposition of unknown\nreal essences, whereby they are distinguished, endeavour to copy the\nsubstances that exist in the world, by putting together the ideas of\nthose sensible qualities which are found co-existing in them, though\nthey come much nearer a likeness of them than those who imagine they\nknow not what real specific essences: yet they arrive not at perfectly\nadequate ideas of those substances they would thus copy into their\nminds: nor do those copies exactly and fully contain all that is to be\nfound in their archetypes. Because those qualities and powers of\nsubstances, whereof we make their complex ideas, are so many and\nvarious, that no man\u2019s complex idea contains them all. That our complex\nideas of substances do not contain in them ALL the simple ideas that\nare united in the things themselves is evident, in that men do rarely\nput into their complex idea of any substance all the simple ideas they\ndo know to exist in it. Because, endeavouring to make the signification\nof their names as clear and as little cumbersome as they can, they make\ntheir specific ideas of the sorts of substance, for the most part, of a\nfew of those simple ideas which are to be found in them: but these\nhaving no original precedency, or right to be put in, and make the\nspecific idea, more than others that are left out, it is plain that\nboth these ways our ideas of substances are deficient and inadequate.\nThe simple ideas whereof we make our complex ones of substances are all\nof them (bating only the figure and bulk of some sorts) powers; which\nbeing relations to other substances, we can never be sure that we know\nALL the powers that are in any one body, till we have tried what\nchanges it is fitted to give to or receive from other substances in\ntheir several ways of application: which being impossible to be tried\nupon any one body, much less upon all, it is impossible we should have\nadequate ideas of any substance made up of a collection of all its\nproperties.\n9. Their powers usually make up our complex ideas of substances.\nWhosoever first lighted on a parcel of that sort of substance we denote\nby the word GOLD, could not rationally take the bulk and figure he\nobserved in that lump to depend on its real essence, or internal\nconstitution. Therefore those never went into his idea of that species\nof body; but its peculiar colour, perhaps, and weight, were the first\nhe abstracted from it, to make the complex idea of that species. Which\nboth are but powers; the one to affect our eyes after such a manner,\nand to produce in us that idea we call yellow; and the other to force\nupwards any other body of equal bulk, they being put into a pair of\nequal scales, one against another. Another perhaps added to these the\nideas of fusibility and fixedness, two other passive powers, in\nrelation to the operation of fire upon it; another, its ductility and\nsolubility in aqua regia, two other powers, relating to the operation\nof other bodies, in changing its outward figure, or separation of it\ninto insensible parts. These, or parts of these, put together, usually\nmake the complex idea in men\u2019s minds of that sort of body we call GOLD.\n10. Substances have innumerable powers not contained in our complex\nideas of them.\nBut no one who hath considered the properties of bodies in general, or\nthis sort in particular, can doubt that this, called GOLD, has infinite\nother properties not contained in that complex idea. Some who have\nexamined this species more accurately could, I believe, enumerate ten\ntimes as many properties in gold, all of them as inseparable from its\ninternal constitution, as its colour or weight: and it is probable, if\nany one knew all the properties that are by divers men known of this\nmetal, there would be an hundred times as many ideas go to the complex\nidea of gold as any one man yet has in his; and yet perhaps that not be\nthe thousandth part of what is to be discovered in it. The changes that\nthat one body is apt to receive, and make in other bodies, upon a due\napplication, exceeding far not only what we know, but what we are apt\nto imagine. Which will not appear so much a paradox to any one who will\nbut consider how far men are yet from knowing all the properties of\nthat one, no very compound figure, a triangle; though it be no small\nnumber that are already by mathematicians discovered of it.\n11. Ideas of Substances, being got only by collecting their qualities,\nare all inadequate.\nSo that all our complex ideas of substances are imperfect and\ninadequate. Which would be so also in mathematical figures, if we were\nto have our complex ideas of them, only by collecting their properties\nin reference to other figures. How uncertain and imperfect would our\nideas be of an ellipsis, if we had no other idea of it, but some few of\nits properties? Whereas, having in our plain idea the WHOLE essence of\nthat figure, we from thence discover those properties, and\ndemonstratively see how they flow, and are inseparable from it.\n12. Simple Ideas, [word in Greek], and adequate.\nThus the mind has three sorts of abstract ideas or nominal essences:\nFirst, SIMPLE ideas, which are [word in Greek] or copies; but yet\ncertainly adequate. Because, being intended to express nothing but the\npower in things to produce in the mind such a sensation, that\nsensation, when it is produced, cannot but be the effect of that power.\nSo the paper I write on, having the power in the light (I speak\naccording to the common notion of light) to produce in men the\nsensation which I call white, it cannot but be the effect of such a\npower in something without the mind; since the mind has not the power\nto produce any such idea in itself: and being meant for nothing else\nbut the effect of such a power that simple idea is [* words missing]\nthe sensation of white, in my mind, being the effect of that power\nwhich is in the paper to produce it, is perfectly adequate to that\npower; or else that power would produce a different idea.\n13. Ideas of Substances are Echthypa, and inadequate.\nSecondly, the COMPLEX ideas of SUBSTANCES are ectypes, copies too; but\nnot perfect ones, not adequate: which is very evident to the mind, in\nthat it plainly perceives, that whatever collection of simple ideas it\nmakes of any substance that exists, it cannot be sure that it exactly\nanswers all that are in that substance. Since, not having tried all the\noperations of all other substances upon it, and found all the\nalterations it would receive from, or cause in, other substances, it\ncannot have an exact adequate collection of all its active and passive\ncapacities; and so not have an adequate complex idea of the powers of\nany substance existing, and its relations; which is that sort of\ncomplex idea of substances we have. And, after all, if we would have,\nand actually had, in our complex idea, an exact collection of all the\nsecondary qualities or powers of any substance, we should not yet\nthereby have an idea of the ESSENCE of that thing. For, since the\npowers or qualities that are observable by us are not the real essence\nof that substance, but depend on it, and flow from it, any collection\nwhatsoever of these qualities cannot be the real essence of that thing.\nWhereby it is plain, that our ideas of substances are not adequate; are\nnot what the mind intends them to be. Besides, a man has no idea of\nsubstance in general, nor knows what substance is in itself.\n14. Ideas of Modes and Relations are Archetypes, and cannot be\nadequate.\nThirdly, COMPLEX ideas of MODES AND RELATIONS are originals, and\narchetypes; are not copies, nor made after the pattern of any real\nexistence, to which the mind intends them to be conformable, and\nexactly to answer. These being such collections of simple ideas that\nthe mind itself puts together, and such collections that each of them\ncontains in it precisely all that the mind intends that it should, they\nare archetypes and essences of modes that may exist; and so are\ndesigned only for, and belong only to such modes as, when they do\nexist, have an exact conformity with those complex ideas The ideas,\ntherefore, of modes and relations cannot but be adequate.\nCHAPTER XXXII.\nOF TRUE AND FALSE IDEAS.\n1. Truth and Falsehood properly belong to Propositions, not to Ideas.\nThough truth and falsehood belong, in propriety of speech, only to\nPROPOSITIONS: yet IDEAS are oftentimes termed true or false (as what\nwords are there that are not used with great latitude, and with some\ndeviation from their strict and proper significations?) Though I think\nthat when ideas themselves are termed true or false, there is still\nsome secret or tacit proposition, which is the foundation of that\ndenomination: as we shall see, if we examine the particular occasions\nwherein they come to be called true or false. In all which we shall\nfind some kind of affirmation or negation, which is the reason of that\ndenomination. For our ideas, being nothing but bare APPEARANCES, or\nperceptions in our minds, cannot properly and simply in themselves be\nsaid to be true or false, no more than a single name of anything can be\nsaid to be true or false.\n2. Ideas and words may be said to be true, inasmuch as they really are\nideas and words.\nIndeed both ideas and words may be said to be true, in a metaphysical\nsense of the word truth; as all other things that any way exist are\nsaid to be true, i.e. really to be such as they exist. Though in things\ncalled true, even in that sense, there is perhaps a secret reference to\nour ideas, looked upon as the standards of that truth; which amounts to\na mental proposition, though it be usually not taken notice of.\n3. No Idea, as an Appearance in the Mind, either true or false.\nBut it is not in that metaphysical sense of truth which we inquire\nhere, when we examine, whether our ideas are capable of being true or\nfalse, but in the more ordinary acceptation of those words: and so I\nsay that the ideas in our minds, being only so many perceptions or\nappearances there, none of them are false; the idea of a centaur having\nno more falsehood in it when it appears in our minds, than the name\ncentaur has falsehood in it, when it is pronounced by our mouths, or\nwritten on paper. For truth or falsehood lying always in some\naffirmation or negation, mental or verbal, our ideas are not capable,\nany of them, of being false, till the mind passes some judgment on\nthem; that is, affirms or denies something of them.\n4. Ideas referred to anything extraneous to them may be true or false.\nWhenever the mind refers any of its ideas to anything extraneous to\nthem, they are then capable to be called true or false. Because the\nmind, in such a reference, makes a tacit supposition of their\nconformity to that thing; which supposition, as it happens to be true\nor false, so the ideas themselves come to be denominated. The most\nusual cases wherein this happens, are these following:\n5. Other Men\u2019s Ideas; real Existence; and supposed real Essences, are\nwhat Men usually refer their Ideas to.\nFirst, when the mind supposes any idea it has CONFORMABLE to that in\nOTHER MEN\u2019S MINDS, called by the same common name; v.g. when the mind\nintends or judges its ideas of justice, temperance, religion, to be the\nsame with what other men give those names to.\nSecondly, when the mind supposes any idea it has in itself to be\nCONFORMABLE to some REAL EXISTENCE. Thus the two ideas of a man and a\ncentaur, supposed to be the ideas of real substances, are the one true\nand the other false; the one having a conformity to what has really\nexisted, the other not. Thirdly, when the mind REFERS any of its ideas\nto that REAL constitution and ESSENCE of anything, whereon all its\nproperties depend: and thus the greatest part, if not all our ideas of\nsubstances, are false.\n6. The cause of such Reference.\nThese suppositions the mind is very apt tacitly to make concerning its\nown ideas. But yet, if we will examine it, we shall find it is chiefly,\nif not only, concerning its ABSTRACT complex ideas. For the natural\ntendency of the mind being towards knowledge; and finding that, if it\nshould proceed by and dwell upon only particular things, its progress\nwould be very slow, and its work endless; therefore, to shorten its way\nto knowledge, and make each perception more comprehensive, the first\nthing it does, as the foundation of the easier enlarging its knowledge,\neither by contemplation of the things themselves that it would know, or\nconference with others about them, is to bind them into bundles, and\nrank them so into sorts, that what knowledge it gets of any of them it\nmay thereby with assurance extend to all of that sort; and so advance\nby larger steps in that which is its great business, knowledge. This,\nas I have elsewhere shown, is the reason why we collect things under\ncomprehensive ideas, with names annexed to them, into genera and\nspecies; i.e. into kinds and sorts.\n7. Names of things supposed to carry in them knowledge of their\nessences.\nIf therefore we will warily attend to the motions of the mind, and\nobserve what course it usually takes in its way to knowledge, we shall\nI think find, that the mind having got an idea which it thinks it may\nhave use of either in contemplation or discourse, the first thing it\ndoes is to abstract it, and then get a name to it; and so lay it up in\nits storehouse, the memory, as containing the essence of a sort of\nthings, of which that name is always to be the mark. Hence it is, that\nwe may often observe that, when any one sees a new thing of a kind that\nhe knows not, he presently asks, what it is; meaning by that inquiry\nnothing but the name. As if the name carried with it the knowledge of\nthe species, or the essence of it; whereof it is indeed used as the\nmark, and is generally supposed annexed to it.\n8. How men suppose that their ideas must correspond to things, and to\nthe customary meanings of names.\nBut this ABSTRACT IDEA, being something in the mind, between the thing\nthat exists, and the name that is given to it; it is in our ideas that\nboth the rightness of our knowledge, and the propriety and\nintelligibleness of our speaking, consists. And hence it is that men\nare so forward to suppose, that the abstract ideas they have in their\nminds are such as agree to the things existing without them, to which\nthey are referred; and are the same also to which the names they give\nthem do by the use and propriety of that language belong. For without\nthis double conformity of their ideas, they find they should both think\namiss of things in themselves, and talk of them unintelligibly to\nothers.\n9. Simple Ideas may be false, in reference to others of the same Name,\nbut are least liable to be so.\nFirst, then, I say, that when the truth of our ideas is judged of by\nthe conformity they have to the ideas which other men have, and\ncommonly signify by the same name, they may be any of them false. But\nyet SIMPLE IDEAS are least of all liable to be so mistaken. Because a\nman, by his senses and every day\u2019s observation, may easily satisfy\nhimself what the simple ideas are which their several names that are in\ncommon use stand for; they being but few in number, and such as, if he\ndoubts or mistakes in, he may easily rectify by the objects they are to\nbe found in. Therefore it is seldom that any one mistakes in his names\nof simple ideas, or applies the name red to the idea green, or the name\nsweet to the idea bitter: much less are men apt to confound the names\nof ideas belonging to different senses, and call a colour by the name\nof a taste, &c. Whereby it is evident that the simple ideas they call\nby any name are commonly the same that others have and mean when they\nuse the same names.\n10. Ideas of mixed Modes most liable to be false in this Sense.\nComplex ideas are much more liable to be false in this respect; and the\ncomplex ideas of MIXED MODES, much more than those of substances;\nbecause in substances (especially those which the common and unborrowed\nnames of any language are applied to) some remarkable sensible\nqualities, serving ordinarily to distinguish one sort from another,\neasily preserve those who take any care in the use of their words, from\napplying them to sorts of substances to which they do not at all\nbelong. But in mixed modes we are much more uncertain; it being not so\neasy to determine of several actions, whether they are to be called\nJUSTICE or CRUELTY, LIBERALITY or PRODIGALITY. And so in referring our\nideas to those of other men, called by the same names, ours may be\nfalse; and the idea in our minds, which we express by the word JUSTICE,\nmay perhaps be that which ought to have another name.\n11. Or at least to be thought false.\nBut whether or no our ideas of mixed modes are more liable than any\nsort to be different from those of other men, which are marked by the\nsame names, this at least is certain. That this sort of falsehood is\nmuch more familiarly attributed to our ideas of mixed modes than to any\nother. When a man is thought to have a false idea of JUSTICE, or\nGRATITUDE, or GLORY, it is for no other reason, but that his agrees not\nwith the ideas which each of those names are the signs of in other men.\n12. And why.\nThe reason whereof seems to me to be this: That the abstract ideas of\nmixed modes, being men\u2019s voluntary combinations of such a precise\ncollection of simple ideas, and so the essence of each species being\nmade by men alone, whereof we have no other sensible standard existing\nanywhere but the name itself, or the definition of that name; we having\nnothing else to refer these our ideas of mixed modes to, as a standard\nto which we would conform them, but the ideas of those who are thought\nto use those names in their most proper significations; and, so as our\nideas conform or differ from THEM, they pass for true or false. And\nthus much concerning the truth and falsehood of our ideas, in reference\nto their names.\n13. As referred to Real Existence, none of our Ideas can be false but\nthose of Substances.\nSecondly, as to the truth and falsehood of our ideas, in reference to\nthe real existence of things. When that is made the standard of their\ntruth, none of them can be termed false but only our complex ideas of\nsubstances.\n14. First, Simple Ideas in this Sense not false and why.\nFirst, our simple ideas, being barely such perceptions as God has\nfitted us to receive, and given power to external objects to produce in\nus by established laws and ways, suitable to his wisdom and goodness,\nthough incomprehensible to us, their truth consists in nothing else but\nin such appearances as are produced in us, and must be suitable to\nthose powers he has placed in external objects or else they could not\nbe produced in us: and thus answering those powers, they are what they\nshould be, true ideas. Nor do they become liable to any imputation of\nfalsehood, if the mind (as in most men I believe it does) judges these\nideas to be in the things themselves. For God in his wisdom having set\nthem as marks of distinction in things, whereby we may be able to\ndiscern one thing from another, and so choose any of them for our uses\nas we have occasion; it alters not the nature of our simple idea,\nwhether we think that the idea of blue be in the violet itself, or in\nour mind only; and only the power of producing it by the texture of its\nparts, reflecting the particles of light after a certain manner, to be\nin the violet itself. For that texture in the object, by a regular and\nconstant operation producing the same idea of blue in us, it serves us\nto distinguish, by our eyes, that from any other thing; whether that\ndistinguishing mark, as it is really in the violet, be only a peculiar\ntexture of parts, or else that very colour, the idea whereof (which is\nin us) is the exact resemblance. And it is equally from that appearance\nto be denominated blue, whether it be that real colour, or only a\npeculiar texture in it, that causes in us that idea: since the name,\nBLUE, notes properly nothing but that mark of distinction that is in a\nviolet, discernible only by our eyes, whatever it consists in; that\nbeing beyond our capacities distinctly to know, and perhaps would be of\nless use to us, if we had faculties to discern.\n15. Though one Man\u2019s Idea of Blue should be different from another\u2019s.\nNeither would it carry any imputation of falsehood to our simple ideas,\nif by the different structure of our organs it were so ordered, that\nTHE SAME OBJECT SHOULD PRODUCE IN SEVERAL MEN\u2019S MINDS DIFFERENT IDEAS\nat the same time; v.g. if the idea that a violet produced in one man\u2019s\nmind by his eyes were the same that a marigold produced in another\nman\u2019s, and vice versa. For, since this could never be known, because\none man\u2019s mind could not pass into another man\u2019s body, to perceive what\nappearances were produced by those organs; neither the ideas hereby,\nnor the names, would be at all confounded, or any falsehood be in\neither. For all things that had the texture of a violet, producing\nconstantly the idea that he called blue, and those which had the\ntexture of a marigold, producing constantly the idea which he as\nconstantly called yellow, whatever those appearances were in his mind;\nhe would be able as regularly to distinguish things for his use by\nthose appearances, and understand and signify those distinctions marked\nby the name blue and yellow, as if the appearances or ideas in his mind\nreceived from those two flowers were exactly the same with the ideas in\nother men\u2019s minds. I am nevertheless very apt to think that the\nsensible ideas produced by any object in different men\u2019s minds, are\nmost commonly very near and undiscernibly alike. For which opinion, I\nthink, there might be many reasons offered: but that being besides my\npresent business, I shall not trouble my reader with them; but only\nmind him, that the contrary supposition, if it could be proved, is of\nlittle use, either for the improvement of our knowledge, or conveniency\nof life, and so we need not trouble ourselves to examine it.\n16. Simple Ideas can none of them be false in respect of real\nexistence.\nFrom what has been said concerning our simple ideas, I think it evident\nthat our simple ideas can none of them be false in respect of things\nexisting without us. For the truth of these appearances or perceptions\nin our minds consisting, as has been said, only in their being\nanswerable to the powers in external objects to produce by our senses\nsuch appearances in us, and each of them being in the mind such as it\nis, suitable to the power that produced it, and which alone it\nrepresents, it cannot upon that account, or as referred to such a\npattern, be false. Blue and yellow, bitter or sweet, can never be false\nideas: these perceptions in the mind are just such as they are there,\nanswering the powers appointed by God to produce them; and so are truly\nwhat they are, and are intended to be. Indeed the names may be\nmisapplied, but that in this respect makes no falsehood in the ideas;\nas if a man ignorant in the English tongue should call purple scarlet.\n17. Secondly, Modes not false cannot be false in reference to essences\nof things.\nSecondly, neither can our complex ideas of modes, in reference to the\nessence of anything really existing, be false; because whatever complex\nideas I have of any mode, it hath no reference to any pattern existing,\nand made by nature; it is not supposed to contain in it any other ideas\nthan what it hath; nor to represent anything but such a complication of\nideas as it does. Thus, when I have the idea of such an action of a man\nwho forbears to afford himself such meat, drink, and clothing, and\nother conveniences of life, as his riches and estate will be sufficient\nto supply and his station requires, I have no false idea; but such an\none as represents an action, either as I find or imagine it, and so is\ncapable of neither truth nor falsehood. But when I give the name\nFRUGALITY or VIRTUE to this action, then it may be called a false idea,\nif thereby it be supposed to agree with that idea to which, in\npropriety of speech, the name of frugality doth belong, or to be\nconformable to that law which is the standard of virtue and vice.\n18. Thirdly, Ideas of Substances may be false in reference to existing\nthings.\nThirdly, our complex ideas of substances, being all referred to\npatterns in things themselves, may be false. That they are all false,\nwhen looked upon as the representations of the unknown essences of\nthings, is so evident that there needs nothing to be said of it. I\nshall therefore pass over that chimerical supposition, and consider\nthem as collections of simple ideas in the mind, taken from\ncombinations of simple ideas existing together constantly in things, of\nwhich patterns they are the supposed copies; and in this reference of\nthem to the existence of things, they are false ideas:\u2014(1) When they\nput together simple ideas, which in the real existence of things have\nno union; as when to the shape and size that exist together in a horse,\nis joined in the same complex idea the power of barking like a dog:\nwhich three ideas, however put together into one in the mind, were\nnever united in nature; and this, therefore, may be called a false idea\nof a horse. (2) Ideas of substances are, in this respect, also false,\nwhen, from any collection of simple ideas that do always exist\ntogether, there is separated, by a direct negation, any other simple\nidea which is constantly joined with them. Thus, if to extension,\nsolidity, fusibility, the peculiar weightiness, and yellow colour of\ngold, any one join in his thoughts the negation of a greater degree of\nfixedness than is in lead or copper, he may be said to have a false\ncomplex idea, as well as when he joins to those other simple ones the\nidea of perfect absolute fixedness. For either way, the complex idea of\ngold being made up of such simple ones as have no union in nature, may\nbe termed false. But, if he leaves out of this his complex idea that of\nfixedness quite, without either actually joining to or separating it\nfrom the rest in his mind, it is, I think, to be looked on as an\ninadequate and imperfect idea, rather than a false one; since, though\nit contains not all the simple ideas that are united in nature, yet it\nputs none together but what do really exist together.\n19. Truth or Falsehood always supposes Affirmation or Negation.\nThough, in compliance with the ordinary way of speaking, I have shown\nin what sense and upon what ground our ideas may be sometimes called\ntrue or false; yet if we will look a little nearer into the matter, in\nall cases where any idea is called true or false, it is from some\nJUDGMENT that the mind makes, or is supposed to make, that is true or\nfalse. For truth or falsehood, being never without some affirmation or\nnegation, express or tacit, it is not to be found but where signs are\njoined or separated, according to the agreement or disagreement of the\nthings they stand for. The signs we chiefly use are either ideas or\nwords; wherewith we make either mental or verbal propositions. Truth\nlies in so joining or separating these representatives, as the things\nthey stand for do in themselves agree or disagree; and falsehood in the\ncontrary, as shall be more fully shown hereafter.\n20. Ideas in themselves neither true nor false.\nAny idea, then, which we have in our minds, whether conformable or not\nto the existence of things, or to any idea in the minds of other men,\ncannot properly for this alone be called false. For these\nrepresentations, if they have nothing in them but what is really\nexisting in things without, cannot be thought false, being exact\nrepresentations of something: nor yet if they have anything in them\ndiffering from the reality of things, can they properly be said to be\nfalse representations, or ideas of things they do not represent. But\nthe mistake and falsehood is:\n21. But are false\u20141. When judged agreeable to another Man\u2019s Idea,\nwithout being so.\nFirst, when the mind having any idea, it JUDGES and concludes it the\nsame that is in other men\u2019s minds, signified by the same name; or that\nit is conformable to the ordinary received signification or definition\nof that word, when indeed it is not: which is the most usual mistake in\nmixed modes, though other ideas also are liable to it.\n22. Secondly, When judged to agree to real Existence, when they do not.\n(2) When it having a complex idea made up of such a collection of\nsimple ones as nature never puts together, it JUDGES it to agree to a\nspecies of creatures really existing; as when it joins the weight of\ntin to the colour, fusibility, and fixedness of gold.\n23. Thirdly, When judged adequate, without being so.\n(3) When in its complex idea it has united a certain number of simple\nideas that do really exist together in some sort of creatures, but has\nalso left out others as much inseparable, it JUDGES this to be a\nperfect complete idea of a sort of things which really it is not; v.g.\nhaving joined the ideas of substance, yellow, malleable, most heavy,\nand fusible, it takes that complex idea to be the complete idea of\ngold, when yet its peculiar fixedness, and solubility in AQUA REGIA,\nare as inseparable from those other ideas, or qualities, of that body\nas they are one from another.\n24. Fourthly, When judged to represent the real Essence.\n(4) The mistake is yet greater, when I JUDGE that this complex idea\ncontains in it the real essence of any body existing; when at least it\ncontains but some few of those properties which flow from its real\nessence and constitution. I say only some few of those properties; for\nthose properties consisting mostly in the active and passive powers it\nhas in reference to other things, all that are vulgarly known of any\none body, of which the complex idea of that kind of things is usually\nmade, are but a very few, in comparison of what a man that has several\nways tried and examined it knows of that one sort of things; and all\nthat the most expert man knows are but a few, in comparison of what are\nreally in that body, and depend on its internal or essential\nconstitution. The essence of a triangle lies in a very little compass,\nconsists in a very few ideas: three lines including a space make up\nthat essence: but the properties that flow from this essence are more\nthan can be easily known or enumerated. So I imagine it is in\nsubstances; their real essences lie in a little compass, though the\nproperties flowing from that internal constitution are endless.\n25. Ideas, when called false.\nTo conclude, a man having no notion of anything without him, but by the\nidea he has of it in his mind, (which idea he has a power to call by\nwhat name he pleases,) he may indeed make an idea neither answering the\nreason of things, nor agreeing to the idea commonly signified by other\npeople\u2019s words; but cannot make a wrong or false idea of a thing which\nis no otherwise known to him but by the idea he has of it: v.g. when I\nframe an idea of the legs, arms, and body of a man, and join to this a\nhorse\u2019s head and neck, I do not make a false idea of anything; because\nit represents nothing without me. But when I call it a MAN or TARTAR,\nand imagine it to represent some real being without me, or to be the\nsame idea that others call by the same name; in either of these cases I\nmay err. And upon this account it is that it comes to be termed a false\nidea; though indeed the falsehood lies not in the idea, but in that\ntacit mental proposition, wherein a conformity and resemblance is\nattributed to it which it has not. But yet, if, having framed such an\nidea in my mind, without thinking either that existence, or the name\nMAN or TARTAR, belongs to it, I will call it MAN or TARTAR, I may be\njustly thought fantastical in the naming; but not erroneous in my\njudgment; nor the idea any way false.\n26. More properly to be called right or wrong.\nUpon the whole matter, I think that our ideas, as they are considered\nby the mind,\u2014either in reference to the proper signification of their\nnames; or in reference to the reality of things,\u2014may very fitly be\ncalled RIGHT or WRONG ideas, according as they agree or disagree to\nthose patterns to which they are referred. But if any one had rather\ncall them true or false, it is fit he use a liberty, which every one\nhas, to call things by those names he thinks best; though, in propriety\nof speech, TRUTH or FALSEHOOD will, I think, scarce agree to them, but\nas they, some way or other, virtually contain in them some mental\nproposition. The ideas that are in a man\u2019s mind, simply considered,\ncannot be wrong; unless complex ones, wherein inconsistent parts are\njumbled together. All other ideas are in themselves right, and the\nknowledge about them right and true knowledge; but when we come to\nrefer them to anything, as to their patterns and archetypes then they\nare capable of being wrong, as far as they disagree with such\narchetypes.\nCHAPTER XXXIII.\nOF THE ASSOCIATION OF IDEAS.\n1. Something unreasonable in most Men.\nThere is scarce any one that does not observe something that seems odd\nto him, and is in itself really extravagant, in the opinions,\nreasonings, and actions of other men. The least flaw of this kind, if\nat all different from his own, every one is quick-sighted enough to\nespy in another, and will by the authority of reason forwardly condemn;\nthough he be guilty of much greater unreasonableness in his own tenets\nand conduct, which he never perceives, and will very hardly, if at all,\nbe convinced of.\n2. Not wholly from Self-love.\nThis proceeds not wholly from self-love, though that has often a great\nhand in it. Men of fair minds, and not given up to the overweening of\nself-flattery, are frequently guilty of it; and in many cases one with\namazement hears the arguings, and is astonished at the obstinacy of a\nworthy man, who yields not to the evidence of reason, though laid\nbefore him as clear as daylight.\n3. Not from Education.\nThis sort of unreasonableness is usually imputed to education and\nprejudice, and for the most part truly enough, though that reaches not\nthe bottom of the disease, nor shows distinctly enough whence it rises,\nor wherein it lies. Education is often rightly assigned for the cause,\nand prejudice is a good general name for the thing itself: but yet, I\nthink, he ought to look a little further, who would trace this sort of\nmadness to the root it springs from, and so explain it, as to show\nwhence this flaw has its original in very sober and rational minds, and\nwherein it consists.\n4. A Degree of Madness found in most Men.\nI shall be pardoned for calling it by so harsh a name as madness, when\nit is considered that opposition to reason deserves that name, and is\nreally madness; and there is scarce a man so free from it, but that if\nhe should always, on all occasions, argue or do as in some cases he\nconstantly does, would not be thought fitter for Bedlam than civil\nconversation. I do not here mean when he is under the power of an\nunruly passion, but in the steady calm course of his life. That which\nwill yet more apologize for this harsh name, and ungrateful imputation\non the greatest part of mankind, is, that, inquiring a little by the\nbye into the nature of madness, (b. ii. ch. xi., Section 13,) I found\nit to spring from the very same root, and to depend on the very same\ncause we are here speaking of. This consideration of the thing itself,\nat a time when I thought not the least on the subject which I am now\ntreating of, suggested it to me. And if this be a weakness to which all\nmen are so liable, if this be a taint which so universally infects\nmankind, the greater care should be taken to lay it open under its due\nname, thereby to excite the greater care in its prevention and cure.\n5. From a wrong Connexion of Ideas.\nSome of our ideas have a NATURAL correspondence and connexion one with\nanother: it is the office and excellency of our reason to trace these,\nand hold them together in that union and correspondence which is\nfounded in their peculiar beings. Besides this, there is another\nconnexion of ideas wholly owing to CHANCE or CUSTOM. Ideas that in\nthemselves are not all of kin, come to be so united in some men\u2019s\nminds, that it is very hard to separate them; they always keep in\ncompany, and the one no sooner at any time comes into the\nunderstanding, but its associate appears with it; and if they are more\nthan two which are thus united, the whole gang, always inseparable,\nshow themselves together.\n6. This Connexion made by custom.\nThis strong combination of ideas, not allied by nature, the mind makes\nin itself either voluntarily or by chance; and hence it comes in\ndifferent men to be very different, according to their different\ninclinations, education, interests, &c. CUSTOM settles habits of\nthinking in the understanding, as well as of determining in the will,\nand of motions in the body: all which seems to be but trains of motions\nin the animal spirits, which, once set a going, continue in the same\nsteps they have been used to; which, by often treading, are worn into a\nsmooth path, and the motion in it becomes easy, and as it were natural.\nAs far as we can comprehend thinking, thus ideas seem to be produced in\nour minds; or, if they are not, this may serve to explain their\nfollowing one another in an habitual train, when once they are put into\ntheir track, as well as it does to explain such motions of the body. A\nmusician used to any tune will find that, let it but once begin in his\nhead, the ideas of the several notes of it will follow one another\norderly in his understanding, without any care or attention, as\nregularly as his fingers move orderly over the keys of the organ to\nplay out the tune he has begun, though his unattentive thoughts be\nelsewhere a wandering. Whether the natural cause of these ideas, as\nwell as of that regular dancing of his fingers be the motion of his\nanimal spirits, I will not determine, how probable soever, by this\ninstance, it appears to be so: but this may help us a little to\nconceive of intellectual habits, and of the tying together of ideas.\n7. Some Antipathies an Effect of it.\nThat there are such associations of them made by custom, in the minds\nof most men, I think nobody will question, who has well considered\nhimself or others; and to this, perhaps, might be justly attributed\nmost of the sympathies and antipathies observable in men, which work as\nstrongly, and produce as regular effects as if they were natural; and\nare therefore called so, though they at first had no other original but\nthe accidental connexion of two ideas, which either the strength of the\nfirst impression, or future indulgence so united, that they always\nafterwards kept company together in that man\u2019s mind, as if they were\nbut one idea. I say most of the antipathies, I do not say all; for some\nof them are truly natural, depend upon our original constitution, and\nare born with us; but a great part of those which are counted natural,\nwould have been known to be from unheeded, though perhaps early,\nimpressions, or wanton fancies at first, which would have been\nacknowledged the original of them, if they had been warily observed. A\ngrown person surfeiting with honey no sooner hears the name of it, but\nhis fancy immediately carries sickness and qualms to his stomach, and\nhe cannot bear the very idea of it; other ideas of dislike, and\nsickness, and vomiting, presently accompany it, and he is disturbed;\nbut he knows from whence to date this weakness, and can tell how he got\nthis indisposition. Had this happened to him by an over-dose of honey\nwhen a child, all the same effects would have followed; but the cause\nwould have been mistaken, and the antipathy counted natural.\n8. Influence of association to be watched educating young children.\nI mention this, not out of any great necessity there is in this present\nargument to distinguish nicely between natural and acquired\nantipathies; but I take notice of it for another purpose, viz. that\nthose who have children, or the charge of their education, would think\nit worth their while diligently to watch, and carefully to prevent the\nundue connexion of ideas in the minds of young people. This is the time\nmost susceptible of lasting impressions; and though those relating to\nthe health of the body are by discreet people minded and fenced\nagainst, yet I am apt to doubt, that those which relate more peculiarly\nto the mind, and terminate in the understanding or passions, have been\nmuch less heeded than the thing deserves: nay, those relating purely to\nthe understanding, have, as I suspect, been by most men wholly\noverlooked.\n9. Wrong connexion of ideas a great Cause of Errors.\nThis wrong connexion in our minds of ideas in themselves loose and\nindependent of one another, has such an influence, and is of so great\nforce to set us awry in our actions, as well moral as natural,\npassions, reasonings, and notions themselves, that perhaps there is not\nany one thing that deserves more to be looked after.\n10. As instance.\nThe ideas of goblins and sprites have really no more to do with\ndarkness than light: yet let but a foolish maid inculcate these often\non the mind of a child, and raise them there together, possibly he\nshall never be able to separate them again so long as he lives, but\ndarkness shall ever afterwards bring with it those frightful ideas, and\nthey shall be so joined, that he can no more bear the one than the\nother.\n11. Another instance.\nA man receives a sensible injury from another, thinks on the man and\nthat action over and over, and by ruminating on them strongly, or much,\nin his mind, so cements those two ideas together, that he makes them\nalmost one; never thinks on the man, but the pain and displeasure he\nsuffered comes into his mind with it, so that he scarce distinguishes\nthem, but has as much an aversion for the one as the other. Thus\nhatreds are often begotten from slight and innocent occasions, and\nquarrels propagated and continued in the world.\n12. A third instance.\nA man has suffered pain or sickness in any place; he saw his friend die\nin such a room: though these have in nature nothing to do one with\nanother, yet when the idea of the place occurs to his mind, it brings\n(the impression being once made) that of the pain and displeasure with\nit: he confounds them in his mind, and can as little bear the one as\nthe other.\n13. Why Time cures some Disorders in the Mind, which Reason cannot\ncure.\nWhen this combination is settled, and while it lasts, it is not in the\npower of reason to help us, and relieve us from the effects of it.\nIdeas in our minds, when they are there, will operate according to\ntheir natures and circumstances. And here we see the cause why time\ncures certain affections, which reason, though in the right, and\nallowed to be so, has not power over, nor is able against them to\nprevail with those who are apt to hearken to it in other cases. The\ndeath of a child that was the daily delight of its mother\u2019s eyes, and\njoy of her soul, rends from her heart the whole comfort of her life,\nand gives her all the torment imaginable: use the consolations of\nreason in this case, and you were as good preach ease to one on the\nrack, and hope to allay, by rational discourses, the pain of his joints\ntearing asunder. Till time has by disuse separated the sense of that\nenjoyment and its loss, from the idea of the child returning to her\nmemory, all representations, though ever so reasonable, are in vain;\nand therefore some in whom the union between these ideas is never\ndissolved, spend their lives in mourning, and carry an incurable sorrow\nto their graves.\n14. Another instance of the Effect of the Association of Ideas.\nA friend of mine knew one perfectly cured of madness by a very harsh\nand offensive operation. The gentleman who was thus recovered, with\ngreat sense of gratitude and acknowledgment owned the cure all his life\nafter, as the greatest obligation he could have received; but, whatever\ngratitude and reason suggested to him, he could never bear the sight of\nthe operator: that image brought back with it the idea of that agony\nwhich he suffered from his hands, which was too mighty and intolerable\nfor him to endure.\n15. More instances.\nMany children, imputing the pain they endured at school to their books\nthey were corrected for, so join those ideas together, that a book\nbecomes their aversion, and they are never reconciled to the study and\nuse of them all their lives after; and thus reading becomes a torment\nto them, which otherwise possibly they might have made the great\npleasure of their lives. There are rooms convenient enough, that some\nmen cannot study in, and fashions of vessels, which, though ever so\nclean and commodious, they cannot drink out of, and that by reason of\nsome accidental ideas which are annexed to them, and make them\noffensive; and who is there that hath not observed some man to flag at\nthe appearance, or in the company of some certain person not otherwise\nsuperior to him, but because, having once on some occasion got the\nascendant, the idea of authority and distance goes along with that of\nthe person, and he that has been thus subjected, is not able to\nseparate them.\n16. A curious instance.\nInstances of this kind are so plentiful everywhere, that if I add one\nmore, it is only for the pleasant oddness of it. It is of a young\ngentleman, who, having learnt to dance, and that to great perfection,\nthere happened to stand an old trunk in the room where he learnt. The\nidea of this remarkable piece of household stuff had so mixed itself\nwith the turns and steps of all his dances, that though in that chamber\nhe could dance excellently well, yet it was only whilst that trunk was\nthere; nor could he perform well in any other place, unless that or\nsome such other trunk had its due position in the room. If this story\nshall be suspected to be dressed up with some comical circumstances, a\nlittle beyond precise nature, I answer for myself that I had it some\nyears since from a very sober and worthy man, upon his own knowledge,\nas I report it; and I dare say there are very few inquisitive persons\nwho read this, who have not met with accounts, if not examples, of this\nnature, that may parallel, or at least justify this.\n17. Influence of Association on intellectual Habits.\nIntellectual habits and defects this way contracted, are not less\nfrequent and powerful, though less observed. Let the ideas of being and\nmatter be strongly joined, either by education or much thought; whilst\nthese are still combined in the mind, what notions, what reasonings,\nwill there be about separate spirits? Let custom from the very\nchildhood have joined figure and shape to the idea of God, and what\nabsurdities will that mind be liable to about the Deity? Let the idea\nof infallibility be inseparably joined to any person, and these two\nconstantly together possess the mind; and then one body in two places\nat once, shall unexamined be swallowed for a certain truth, by an\nimplicit faith, whenever that imagined infallible person dictates and\ndemands assent without inquiry.\n18. Observable in the opposition between different Sects of philosophy\nand of religion.\nSome such wrong and unnatural combinations of ideas will be found to\nestablish the irreconcilable opposition between different sects of\nphilosophy and religion; for we cannot imagine every one of their\nfollowers to impose wilfully on himself, and knowingly refuse truth\noffered by plain reason. Interest, though it does a great deal in the\ncase, yet cannot be thought to work whole societies of men to so\nuniversal a perverseness, as that every one of them to a man should\nknowingly maintain falsehood: some at least must be allowed to do what\nall pretend to, i.e. to pursue truth sincerely; and therefore there\nmust be something that blinds their understandings, and makes them not\nsee the falsehood of what they embrace for real truth. That which thus\ncaptivates their reasons, and leads men of sincerity blindfold from\ncommon sense, will, when examined, be found to be what we are speaking\nof: some independent ideas, of no alliance to one another, are, by\neducation, custom, and the constant din of their party, so coupled in\ntheir minds, that they always appear there together; and they can no\nmore separate them in their thoughts than if they were but one idea,\nand they operate as if they were so. This gives sense to jargon,\ndemonstration to absurdities, and consistency to nonsense, and is the\nfoundation of the greatest, I had almost said of all the errors in the\nworld; or, if it does not reach so far, it is at least the most\ndangerous one, since, so far as it obtains, it hinders men from seeing\nand examining. When two things, in themselves disjoined, appear to the\nsight constantly united; if the eye sees these things riveted which are\nloose, where will you begin to rectify the mistakes that follow in two\nideas that they have been accustomed so to join in their minds as to\nsubstitute one for the other, and, as I am apt to think, often without\nperceiving it themselves? This, whilst they are under the deceit of it,\nmakes them incapable of conviction, and they applaud themselves as\nzealous champions for truth, when indeed they are contending for error;\nand the confusion of two different ideas, which a customary connexion\nof them in their minds hath to them made in effect but one, fills their\nheads with false views, and their reasonings with false consequences.\n19. Conclusion.\nHaving thus given an account of the original, sorts, and extent of our\nIDEAS, with several other considerations about these (I know not\nwhether I may say) instruments, or materials of our knowledge, the\nmethod I at first proposed to myself would now require that I should\nimmediately proceed to show, what use the understanding makes of them,\nand what KNOWLEDGE we have by them. This was that which, in the first\ngeneral view I had of this subject, was all that I thought I should\nhave to do: but, upon a nearer approach, I find that there is so close\na connexion between ideas and WORDS, and our abstract ideas and general\nwords have so constant a relation one to another, that it is impossible\nto speak clearly and distinctly of our knowledge, which all consists in\npropositions, without considering, first, the nature, use, and\nsignification of Language; which, therefore, must be the business of\nthe next Book.\nEND OF VOLUME I", "source": "essay_human_understanding_vol1.txt"}
