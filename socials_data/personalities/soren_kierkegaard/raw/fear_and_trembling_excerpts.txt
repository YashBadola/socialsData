PREFACE

Not only in the world of commerce but also in the world of ideas our
age is putting on a veritable clearance sale. Everything can be had
so dirt cheap that one begins to wonder whether in the end anyone
will want to make a bid.

PRELUDE

Once upon a time there was a man who as a child had heard the beautiful
story about how God tempted Abraham, and how he withstood the temptation,
kept the faith, and a second time received again a son contrary to
expectation. When the man became older, he read the same story with even
greater admiration, for life had separated what had been united in the
pious simplicity of the child. The older he became, the more frequently
his thoughts turned to that story; his enthusiasm became greater and
greater, and yet he was less and less able to understand the story. At
last he forgot everything else because of it; his soul had but one wish,
to see Abraham, one longing, to have been witness to that event.

PROBLEM I
Is there a Teleological Suspension of the Ethical?

The ethical as such is the universal, it applies to everyone, and the
same thing may be expressed from another point of view by saying that
it applies every instant. It rests immanent in itself, has nothing
without itself which is its telos, but is itself telos for everything
outside it, and when this has been incorporated by the ethical it can
go no further. Conceived immediately as physical and psychical, the
particular individual is the particular which has its telos in the
universal, and its task is to express itself constantly in it, to
abolish its particularity in order to become the universal. As soon as
the particular individual asserts himself in his particularity over
against the universal, he sins, and only by recognizing this can he
again reconcile himself with the universal.

Faith is precisely this paradox, that the individual as the particular
is higher than the universal, is justified over against it, is not
subordinate but superior—yet in such a way, be it observed, that it
is the particular individual who, after he has been subordinated as the
particular to the universal, now through the universal becomes the
individual who as the particular is superior to the universal, for the
fact that the individual as the particular stands in an absolute
relation to the absolute. This position cannot be mediated, for all
mediation comes about precisely by virtue of the universal; it is and
remains to all eternity a paradox, inaccessible to thought. And yet
faith is this paradox—or else (these are the logical deductions which
I would beg the reader to judge for himself, though I by no means
make it out to be easily understood)—or else there is no faith at all,
but Abraham is lost, and faith has never existed in the world...
