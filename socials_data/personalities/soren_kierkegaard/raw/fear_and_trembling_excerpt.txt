The ethical expression for what Abraham did is that he would murder Isaac; the religious expression is that he would sacrifice Isaac--but precisely in this contradiction is the anxiety that can make a person sleepless, and yet without this anxiety Abraham is not who he is.

Faith is precisely this paradox, that the single individual is higher than the universal, yet in such a way, be it observed, that the movement repeats itself, and that consequently the single individual, after having been in the universal, now as the single individual isolates himself as higher than the universal.

If faith does not make it a holy act to be willing to murder one's son, then let the same judgment be passed upon Abraham as upon every other man.
