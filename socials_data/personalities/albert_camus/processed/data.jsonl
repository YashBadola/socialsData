{"text": "The gods had condemned Sisyphus to ceaselessly rolling a rock to the top of a mountain, whence the stone would fall back of its own weight. They had thought with some reason that there is no more dreadful punishment than futile and hopeless labor. If one believes Homer, Sisyphus was the wisest and most prudent of mortals. According to another tradition, however, he was disposed to practice the profession of highwayman. I see no contradiction in this. Opinions differ as to the reasons why he became the futile laborer of the underworld. To begin with, he is accused of a certain levity in regard to the gods. He stole their secrets.\nI leave Sisyphus at the foot of the mountain! One always finds one's burden again. But Sisyphus teaches the higher fidelity that negates the gods and raises rocks. He too concludes that all is well. This universe henceforth without a master seems to him neither sterile nor futile. Each atom of that stone, each mineral flake of that night-filled mountain, in itself forms a world. The struggle itself toward the heights is enough to fill a man's heart. One must imagine Sisyphus happy.\nMaman died today. Or maybe yesterday; I can't be sure. I received a telegram from the home: \"Mother deceased. Funeral tomorrow. Faithfully yours.\" That doesn't mean anything. Maybe it was yesterday.\nThe only way to deal with an unfree world is to become so absolutely free that your very existence is an act of rebellion.\nEvery act of rebellion expresses a nostalgia for innocence and an appeal to the essence of being.\nIn the midst of winter, I found there was, within me, an invincible summer. And that makes me happy. For it says that no matter how hard the world pushes against me, within me, there\u2019s something stronger \u2013 something better, pushing right back.\nI opened myself to the gentle indifference of the world. Finding it so much like myself\u2014so like a brother, really\u2014I felt that I had been happy and that I was happy again.\nThe realization that life is absurd cannot be an end, but only a beginning.\nMan is the only creature who refuses to be what he is.\nFreedom is nothing but a chance to be better.\nDon't walk behind me; I may not lead. Don't walk in front of me; I may not follow. Just walk beside me and be my friend.\nNobody realizes that some people expend tremendous energy merely to be normal.\nTo be happy, we must not be too concerned with others.\nFiction is the lie through which we tell the truth.", "source": "quotes_and_excerpts.txt"}
