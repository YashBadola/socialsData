{"text": "CHAPTER I.\nVoyage of an inhabitant of the Sirius star to the planet Saturn.\nOn one of the planets that orbits the star named Sirius there lived a\nspirited young man, who I had the honor of meeting on the last voyage\nhe made to our little ant hill. He was called Micromegas[1], a\nfitting name for anyone so great. He was eight leagues tall, or\n24,000 geometric paces of five feet each.\n[1] From _micros_, small, and from _megas_, large.  B.\nCertain geometers[2], always of use to the public, will immediately\ntake up their pens, and will find that since Mr. Micromegas,\ninhabitant of the country of Sirius, is 24,000 paces tall, which is\nequivalent to 120,000 feet, and since we citizens of the earth are\nhardly five feet tall, and our sphere 9,000 leagues around; they will\nfind, I say, that it is absolutely necessary that the sphere that\nproduced him was 21,600,000 times greater in circumference than our\nlittle Earth. Nothing in nature is simpler or more orderly. The\nsovereign states of Germany or Italy, which one can traverse in a\nhalf hour, compared to the empires of Turkey, Moscow, or China, are\nonly feeble reflections of the prodigious differences that nature has\nplaced in all beings.\n[2] This is how the text reads in the first editions. Others, in\nplace of \"geometers,\" put \"algebraists.\"  B.\nHis excellency's size being as great as I have said, all our\nsculptors and all our painters will agree without protest that his\nbelt would have been 50,000 feet around, which gives him very good\nproportions.[3] His nose taking up one third of his attractive\nface, and his attractive face taking up one seventh of his attractive\nbody, it must be admitted that the nose of the Sirian is 6,333 feet\nplus a fraction; which is manifest.\n[3] I restore this sentence in accordance with the first editions.\nB.\nAs for his mind, it is one of the most cultivated that we have. He\nknows many things. He invented some of them. He was not even 250\nyears old when he studied, as is customary, at the most celebrated[4]\ncolleges of his planet, where he managed to figure out by pure\nwillpower more than 50 of Euclid's propositions. That makes 18 more\nthan Blaise Pascal, who, after having figured out 32 while screwing\naround, according to his sister's reports, later became a fairly\nmediocre geometer[5] and a very bad metaphysician. Towards his 450th\nyear, near the end of his infancy, he dissected many small insects no\nmore than 100 feet in diameter, which would evade ordinary\nmicroscopes. He wrote a very curious book about this, and it gave him\nsome income. The mufti of his country, an extremely ignorant\nworrywart, found some suspicious, rash[6], disagreeable, and\nheretical propositions in the book, smelled heresy, and pursued it\nvigorously; it was a matter of finding out whether the substantial\nform of the fleas of Sirius were of the same nature as those of the\nsnails. Micromegas gave a spirited defense; he brought in some women\nto testify in his favor; the trial lasted 220 years. Finally the\nmufti had the book condemned by jurisconsults who had not read it,\nand the author was ordered not to appear in court for 800 years[7].\n[4] In place of \"the most celebrated\" that one finds in the first\nedition, subsequent editions read \"some jesuit.\"  B.\n[5] Pascal became a very great geometer, not in the same class as\nthose that contributed to the progress of science with great\ndiscoveries, like Descartes, Newton, but certainly ranked among\nthe geometers, whose works display a genius of the first order. K.\n[6]  The edition that I believe to be original reads: \"rash,\nsmelling heresy.\" The present text is dated 1756.  B.\n[7] Mr. Voltaire had been persecuted by the theatin Boyer for\nhaving stated in his _Letters on the English_ that our souls\ndevelop at the same time as our organs, just like the souls of\nanimals.  K.\nHe was thereby dealt the minor affliction of being banished from a\ncourt that consisted of nothing but harassment and pettiness. He\nwrote an amusing song at the expense of the mufti, which the latter\nhardly noticed; and he took to voyaging from planet to planet in\norder to develop his heart and mind[8], as the saying goes. Those\nthat travel only by stage coach or sedan will probably be surprised\nlearn of the carriage of this vessel; for we, on our little pile of\nmud, can only conceive of that to which we are accustomed. Our\nvoyager was very familiar with the laws of gravity and with all the\nother attractive and repulsive forces. He utilized them so well that,\nwhether with the help of a ray of sunlight or some comet, he jumped\nfrom globe to globe like a bird vaulting itself from branch to\nbranch. He quickly spanned the Milky Way, and I am obliged to report\nthat he never saw, throughout the stars it is made up of, the\nbeautiful empyrean sky that the vicar Derham[9] boasts of having seen\nat the other end of his telescope. I do not claim that Mr. Derham has\npoor eyesight, God forbid! But Micromegas was on site, which makes\nhim a reliable witness, and I do not want to contradict anyone.\nMicromegas, after having toured around, arrived at the planet Saturn.\nAs accustomed as he was to seeing new things, he could not, upon\nseeing the smallness of the planet and its inhabitants, stop himself\nfrom smiling with the superiority that occasionally escapes the\nwisest of us. For in the end Saturn is hardly nine times bigger than\nEarth, and the citizens of this country are dwarfs, no more than a\nthousand fathoms tall, or somewhere around there. He and his men\npoked fun at them at first, like Italian musicians laughing at the\nmusic of Lully when he comes to France. But, as the Sirian had a good\nheart, he understood very quickly that a thinking being is not\nnecessarily ridiculous just because he is only 6,000 feet tall. He\ngot to know the Saturnians after their shock wore off. He built a\nstrong friendship with the secretary of the academy of Saturn, a\nspirited man who had not invented anything, to tell the truth, but\nwho understood the inventions of others very well, and who wrote some\npassable verses and carried out some complicated calculations. I will\nreport here, for the reader's satisfaction, a singular conversation\nthat Micromegas had with the secretary one day.\n[8]  See my note, page 110.  B.  [this note, in Zadig, says: \"This\nline is mostly written at the expense of Rollin, who often employs\nthese expressions in his _Treatise on Studies_. Voltaire returns\nto it often: see, in the present volume, chapter I of Micromegas,\nand in volume XXXIV, chapter XI of _The Man of Forty Crowns_,\nchapter IX of _The White Bull_ and volume XI, the second verse of\nsong VIII of _The Young Virgin_.  B.\"]\n[9] English savant, author of _Astro-Theology_, and several other\nworks that seek to prove the existence of God through detailing\nthe wonders of nature: unfortunately he and his imitators are\noften mistaken in their explanation of these wonders; they rave\nabout the wisdom that is revealed in a phenomenon, but one soon\ndiscovers that the phenomenon is completely different than they\nsupposed; so it is only their own fabrications that give them this\nimpression of wisdom. This fault, common to all works of its type,\ndiscredited them. One knows too far in advance that the author\nwill end up admiring whatever he has chosen to discuss.\nCHAPTER II.\nConversation between the inhabitant of Sirius and that of Saturn.\nAfter his excellency laid himself down to rest the secretary\napproached him.\n\"You have to admit,\" said Micromegas, \"that nature is extremely\nvaried.\"\n\"Yes,\" said the Saturnian, \"nature is like a flower bed wherein the\nflowers--\"\n\"Ugh!\" said the other, \"leave off with flower beds.\"\nThe secretary began again. \"Nature is like an assembly of blonde and\nbrown-haired girls whose jewels--\"\n\"What am I supposed to do with your brown-haired girls?\" said the\nother.\n\"Then she is like a gallery of paintings whose features--\"\n\"Certainly not!\" said the voyager. \"I say again that nature is like\nnature. Why bother looking for comparisons?\"\n\"To please you,\" replied the Secretary.\n\"I do not want to be pleased,\" answered the voyager. \"I want to be\ntaught. Tell me how many senses the men of your planet have.\"\n\"We only have 72,\" said the academic, \"and we always complain about\nit. Our imagination surpasses our needs. We find that with our 72\nsenses, our ring, our five moons, we are too restricted; and in spite\nof all our curiosity and the fairly large number of passions that\nresult from our 72 senses, we have plenty of time to get bored.\"\n\"I believe it,\" said Micromegas, \"for on our planet we have almost\n1,000 senses; and yet we still have a kind of vague feeling, a sort\nof worry, that warns us that there are even more perfect beings. I\nhave traveled a bit; and I have seen mortals that surpass us, some\nfar superior. But I have not seen any that desire only what they\ntruly need, and who need only what they indulge in. Maybe someday I\nwill happen upon a country that lacks nothing; but so far no one has\ngiven me any word of a place like that.\"\nThe Saturnian and the Sirian proceeded to wear themselves out in\nspeculating; but after a lot of very ingenious and very dubious\nreasoning, it was necessary to return to the facts.\n\"How long do you live?\" said the Sirian.\n\"Oh! For a very short time,\" replied the small man from Saturn.\n\"Same with us,\" said the Sirian. \"we always complain about it. It\nmust be a universal law of nature.\"\n\"Alas! We only live through 500 revolutions around the sun,\" said the\nSaturnian. (This translates to about 15,000 years, by our standards.)\n\"You can see yourself that this is to die almost at the moment one is\nborn; our existence is a point, our lifespan an instant, our planet\nan atom. Hardly do we begin to learn a little when death arrives,\nbefore we get any experience. As for me, I do not dare make any\nplans. I see myself as a drop of water in an immense ocean. I am\nashamed, most of all before you, of how ridiculously I figure in this\nworld.\"\nMicromegas replied, \"If you were not a philosopher, I would fear\nburdening you by telling you that our lifespan is 700 times longer\nthan yours; but you know very well when it is necessary to return\nyour body to the elements, and reanimate nature in another form,\nwhich we call death. When this moment of metamorphosis comes, to have\nlived an eternity or to have lived a day amounts to precisely the\nsame thing. I have been to countries where they live a thousand times\nlonger than we do, and they also die. But people everywhere have the\ngood sense to know their role and to thank the Author of nature. He\nhas scattered across this universe a profusion of varieties with a\nkind of admirable uniformity. For example, all the thinking beings\nare different, and all resemble one another in the gift of thought\nand desire. Matter is extended everywhere, but has different\nproperties on each planet. How many diverse properties do you count\nin yours?\"\n\"If you mean those properties,\" said the Saturnian, \"without which we\nbelieve that the planet could not subsist as it is, we count 300 of\nthem, like extension, impenetrability, mobility, gravity,\ndivisibility, and the rest.\"\n\"Apparently,\" replied the voyager, \"this small number suffices for\nwhat the Creator had in store for your dwelling. I admire his wisdom\nin everything; I see differences everywhere, but also proportion.\nYour planet is small, your inhabitants are as well. You have few\nsensations; your matter has few properties; all this is the work of\nProvidence. What color is your sun upon examination?\"\n\"A very yellowish white,\" said the Saturnian. \"And when we divide one\nof its rays, we find that it contains seven colors.\"\n\"Our sun strains at red,\" said the Sirian, \"and we have 39 primary\ncolors. There is no one sun, among those that I have gotten close to\nthat resembles it, just as there is no one face among you that is\nidentical to the others.\"\nAfter numerous questions of this nature, he learned how many\nessentially different substances are found on Saturn. He learned that\nthere were only about thirty, like God, space, matter, the beings\nwith extension that sense, the beings with extension that sense and\nthink, the thinking beings that have no extension; those that are\npenetrable, those that are not, and the rest. The Sirian, whose home\ncontained 300 and who had discovered 3,000 of them in his voyages,\nprodigiously surprised the philosopher of Saturn. Finally, after\nhaving told each other a little of what they knew and a lot of what\nthey did not know, after having reasoned over the course of a\nrevolution around the sun, they resolved to go on a small\nphilosophical voyage together.\nCHAPTER III.\nVoyage of the two inhabitants of Sirius and Saturn.\nOur two philosophers were just ready to take off into Saturn's\natmosphere with a very nice provision of mathematical instrument when\nthe ruler of Saturn, who had heard news of the departure, came in\ntears to remonstrate. She was a pretty, petite brunette who was only\n660 fathoms tall, but who compensated for this small size with many\nother charms.\n\"Cruelty!\" she cried, \"after resisting you for 1,500 years, just when\nI was beginning to come around, when I'd spent hardly a hundred[1]\nyears in your arms, you leave me to go on a voyage with a giant from\nanother world; go, you're only curious, you've never been in love: if\nyou were a true Saturnian, you would be faithful. Where are you\nrunning off to? What do you want? Our five moons are less errant than\nyou, our ring less inconsistent. It's over, I will never love anyone\never again.\"\nThe philosopher embraced her, cried with her, philosopher that he\nwas; and the woman, after swooning, went off to console herself with\nthe help of one of the dandies of the country.\n[1] The 1773 edition is the first that reads \"a hundred\"; all the\nearlier editions read: \"two hundred.\"  B.\nOur two explorers left all the same; they alighted first on the ring,\nwhich they found to be fairly flat, as conjectured by an illustrious\ninhabitant of our little sphere[2]; from there they went easily from\nmoon to moon. A comet passed by the last; they flew onto it with\ntheir servants and their instruments. When they had traveled about\none hundred fifty million leagues, they met with the satellites of\nJupiter. They stopped at Jupiter and stayed for a week, during which\ntime they learned some very wonderful secrets that would have been\nforthcoming in print if not for the inquisition, which found some of\nthe propositions to be a little harsh. But I have read the manuscript\nin the library of the illustrious archbishop of...., who with a\ngenerosity and goodness that is impossible to praise allowed me to\nsee his books. I promised him a long article in the first edition of\nMor\u00e9ri, and I will not forget his children, who give such a great\nhope of perpetuating the race of their illustrious father.\n[2] Huygens.  See volume XXVI, page 398.  B.\nBut let us now return to our travelers. Upon leaving Jupiter they\ntraversed a space of around one hundred million leagues and\napproached the planet Mars, which, as we know, is five times smaller\nthan our own; they swung by two moons that cater to this planet but\nhave escaped the notice of our astronomers. I know very well that\nFather Castel will write, perhaps even agreeably enough, against the\nexistence of these two moons; but I rely on those who reason by\nanalogy. These good philosophers know how unlikely it would be for\nMars, so far from the sun, to have gotten by with less than two\nmoons. Whatever the case may be, our explorers found it so small that\nthey feared not being able to land on it, and they passed it by like\ntwo travelers disdainful of a bad village cabaret, pressing on\ntowards a neighboring city. But the Sirian and his companion soon\nregretted it. They traveled a long time without finding anything.\nFinally they perceived a small candle, it was earth; this was a\npitiful sight to those who had just left Jupiter. Nevertheless, from\nfear of further regret, they resolved to touch down. Carried by the\ntail of a comet, and finding an aurora borealis at the ready, they\nstarted towards it, and arrived at Earth on the northern coast of the\nBaltic sea, July 5, 1737, new style.\nCHAPTER IV.\nWhat happened on planet Earth.\nAfter resting for some time they ate two mountains for lunch, which\ntheir crew fixed up pretty nicely. Then they decided to get to know\nthe small country they were in. They went first from north to south.\nThe usual stride of the Sirian and his crew was around 30,000 feet.\nThe dwarf from Saturn, who clocked in at no more than a thousand\nfathoms, trailed behind, breathing heavily. He had to make twelve\nsteps each time the other took a stride; imagine (if it is alright to\nmake such a comparison) a very small lapdog following a captain of\nthe guards of the Prussian king.\nSince our strangers moved fairly rapidly, they circumnavigated the\nglobe in 36 hours. The sun, in truth, or rather the Earth, makes a\nsimilar voyage in a day; but you have to imagine that the going is\nmuch easier when one turns on one's axis instead of walking on one's\nfeet. So there they were, back where they started, after having seen\nthe nearly imperceptible pond we call _the Mediterranean_, and the\nother little pool that, under the name _Ocean_, encircles the\nmolehill. The dwarf never got in over his knees, and the other hardly\nwet his heels. On their way they did all they could to see whether\nthe planet was inhabited or not. They crouched, laid down, felt\naround everywhere; but their eyes and their hands were not\nproportionate to the little beings that crawl here, they could not\nfeel in the least any sensation that might lead them to suspect that\nwe and our associates, the other inhabitants of this planet, have the\nhonor of existing.\nThe dwarf, who was a bit hasty sometimes, decided straightaway that\nthe planet was uninhabited. His first reason was that he had not seen\nanyone. Micromegas politely indicated that this logic was rather\nflawed: \"For,\" said he, \"you do not see with your little eyes certain\nstars of the 50th magnitude that I can perceive very distinctly. Do\nyou conclude that these stars do not exist?\"\n\"But,\" said the dwarf, \"I felt around a lot.\"\n\"But,\" answered the other, \"you have pretty weak senses.\"\n\"But,\" replied the dwarf, \"this planet is poorly constructed. It is\nso irregular and has such a ridiculous shape! Everything here seems\nto be in chaos: you see these little rivulets, none of which run in a\nstraight line, these pools of water that are neither round, nor\nsquare, nor oval, nor regular by any measure; all these little pointy\nspecks scattered across the earth that grate on my feet? (This was in\nreference to mountains.) Look at its shape again, how it is flat at\nthe poles, how it clumsily revolves around the sun in a way that\nnecessarily eliminates the climates of the poles? To tell the truth,\nwhat really makes me think it is uninhabited is that it seems that no\none of good sense would want to stay.\"\n\"Well,\" said Micromegas, \"maybe the inhabitants of this planet are\nnot of good sense! But in the end it looks like this may be for a\nreason. Everything appears irregular to you here, you say, because\neverything on Saturn and Jupiter is drawn in straight lines. This\nmight be the[1] reason that you are a bit puzzled here. Have I not\ntold you that I have continually noticed variety in my travels?\"\n[1] All the editions that precede those of Kehl read: \"It might be\nfor this\"  B.\nThe Saturnian responded to all these points. The dispute might never\nhave finished if it were not for Micromegas who, getting worked up,\nhad the good luck to break the thread of his diamond necklace. The\ndiamonds fell; they were pretty little carats of fairly irregular\nsize, of which the largest weighed four hundred pounds and the\nsmallest fifty. The dwarf recaptured some of them; bending down for a\nbetter look, he perceived that these diamonds were cut with the help\nof an excellent microscope. So he took out a small microscope of 160\nfeet in diameter and put it up to his eye; and Micromegas took up one\nof 2,005 feet in diameter. They were excellent; but neither one of\nthem could see anything right away and had to adjust them. Finally\nthe Saturnian saw something elusive that moved in the shallow waters\nof the Baltic sea; it was a whale. He carefully picked it up with his\nlittle finger and, resting it on the nail of his thumb, showed it to\nthe Sirian, who began laughing for a second time at the ludicrously\nsmall scale of the things on our planet. The Saturnian, persuaded\nthat our world was inhabited, figured very quickly that it was\ninhabited only by whales; and as he was very good at reasoning, he\nwas determined to infer the origin and evolution of such a small\natom; whether it had ideas, a will, liberty. Micromegas was confused.\nHe examined the animal very patiently and found no reason to believe\nthat a soul was lodged in it. The two voyagers were therefore\ninclined to believe that there is no spirit in our home, when with\nthe help of the microscope they perceived something as large as a\nwhale floating on the Baltic Sea. We know that a flock of\nphilosophers was at this time returning from the Arctic Circle, where\nthey had made some observations, which no one had dared make up to\nthen. The gazettes claimed that their vessel ran aground on the coast\nof Bothnia, and that they were having a lot of difficulty setting\nthings straight; but the world never shows its cards. I am going to\ntell how it really happened, artlessly and without bias; which is no\nsmall thing for an historian.\nCHAPTER V.\nExperiments and reasonings of the two voyagers.\nMicromegas slowly reached his hand towards the place where the object\nhad appeared, extended two fingers, and withdrew them for fear of\nbeing mistaken, then opened and closed them, and skillfully seized\nthe vessel that carried these fellows, putting it on his fingernail\nwithout pressing it too hard for fear of crushing it.\n\"Here is a very different animal from the first,\" said the dwarf from\nSaturn.\nThe Sirian put the so-called animal in the palm of his hand. The\npassengers and the crew, who believed themselves to have been lifted\nup by a hurricane, and who thought they were on some sort of boulder,\nscurried around; the sailors took the barrels of wine, threw them\noverboard onto Micromegas hand, and followed after. The geometers\ntook their quadrants, their sextants, two Lappland girls[1], and\ndescended onto the Sirian's fingers. They made so much fuss that he\nfinally felt something move, tickling his fingers. It was a steel-tipped\nbaton being pressed into his index finger. He judged, by this\ntickling, that it had been ejected from some small animal that he was\nholding; but he did not suspect anything else at first. The\nmicroscope, which could barely distinguish a whale from a boat, could\nnot capture anything as elusive as a man. I do not claim to outrage\nanyone's vanity, but I am obliged to ask that important men make an\nobservation here. Taking the size of a man to be about five feet, the\nfigure we strike on Earth is like that struck by an animal of about\nsix hundred thousandths[2] the height of a flea on a ball five feet\naround. Imagine something that can hold the Earth in its hands, and\nwhich has organs in proportion to ours--and it may very well be that\nthere are such things--conceive, I beg of you, what these things\nwould think of the battles that allow a vanquisher to take a village\nonly to lose it later.\n[1] See the notes to the speech in verse, \"On Moderation\" (Volume\nXII), and those of \"Russia to Paris\" (Volume XIV).  K.\n[2] The edition that I take to be original reads \"sixty\nthousandths.\"  B.\nI do not doubt that if ever some captain of some troop of imposing\ngrenadiers reads this work he will increase the size of the hats of\nhis troops by at least two imposing feet. But I warn him that it will\nhave been done in vain; that he and his will never grow any larger\nthan infinitely small.\nWhat marvelous skill it must have taken for our philosopher from\nSirius to perceive the atoms I have just spoken of. When Leuwenhoek\nand Hartso\u00ebker tinkered with the first or thought they saw the grains\nthat make us up, they did not by any means make such an astonishing\ndiscovery. What pleasure Micromegas felt at seeing these little\nmachines move, at examining all their scurrying, at following them in\ntheir enterprises! how he cried out! with what joy he placed one of\nhis microscopes in the hands of his traveling companion!\n\"I see them,\" they said at the same time, \"look how they are carrying\nloads, stooping, getting up again.\" They spoke like that, hands\ntrembling from the pleasure of seeing such new objects, and from fear\nof losing them. The Saturnian, passing from an excess of incredulity\nto an excess of credulity, thought he saw them mating.\n\"Ah!\" he said. \"I have caught nature in the act\"[1]. But he was\nfooled by appearances, which happens only too often, whether one is\nusing a microscope or not.\n[1] _j'ai pris la nature sur le fait_. A happy, good-natured turn\nof phrase expressed by Fontenelle upon making some observations of\nnatural history.  K.\nCHAPTER VI.\nWhat happened to them among men.\nMicromegas, a much better observer than his dwarf, clearly saw that\nthe atoms were speaking to each other, and pointed this out to his\ncompanion, who, ashamed of being mistaken about them reproducing, did\nnot want to believe that such a species could communicate. He had the\ngift of language as well as the Sirian. He could not hear the atoms\ntalk, and he supposed that they did not speak. Moreover, how could\nthese impossibly small beings have vocal organs, and what would they\nhave to say? To speak, one must think, more or less; but if they\nthink, they must therefore have the equivalent of a soul. But to\nattribute the equivalent of a soul to this species seemed absurd to\nhim.\n\"But,\" said the Sirian, \"you believed right away that they made love.\nDo you believe that one can make love without thinking and without\nuttering one word, or at least without making oneself heard? Do you\nsuppose as well that it is more difficult to produce an argument than\nan infant? Both appear to be great mysteries to me.\"\n\"I do not dare believe or deny it,\" said the dwarf. \"I have no more\nopinions. We must try to examine these insects and reason after.\"\n\"That is very well said,\" echoed Micromegas, and he briskly took out\na pair of scissors with which he cut his fingernails, and from the\nparings of his thumbnail he improvised a kind of speaking-trumpet,\nlike a vast funnel, and put the end up to his ear. The circumference\nof the funnel enveloped the vessel and the entire crew. The weakest\nvoice entered into the circular fibers of the nails in such a way\nthat, thanks to his industriousness, the philosopher above could hear\nthe drone of our insects below perfectly. In a small number of hours\nhe was able to distinguish words, and finally to understand French.\nThe dwarf managed to do the same, though with more difficulty. The\nvoyagers' surprise redoubled each second. They heard the mites speak\nfairly intelligently. This performance of nature's seemed\ninexplicable to them. You may well believe that the Sirian and the\ndwarf burned with impatience to converse with the atoms. The dwarf\nfeared that his thunderous voice, and assuredly Micromegas, would\ndeafen the mites without being understood. They had to diminish its\nforce. They placed toothpicks in their mouths, whose tapered ends\nfell around the ship. The Sirian put the dwarf on his knees and the\nship with its crew on a fingernail. He lowered his head and spoke\nsoftly. Finally, relying on these precautions and many others, he\nbegan his speech like so:\n\"Invisible insects, that the hand of the Creator has caused to spring\nup in the abyss of the infinitely small, I thank him for allowing me\nto uncover these seemingly impenetrable secrets. Perhaps those at my\ncourt would not deign to give you audience, but I mistrust no one,\nand I offer you my protection.\"\nIf anyone has ever been surprised, it was the people who heard these\nwords. They could not figure out where they were coming from. The\nchaplain of the vessel recited the exorcism prayers, the sailors\nswore, and the philosophers of the vessel constructed systems; but no\nmatter what systems they came up with, they could not figure out who\nwas talking. The dwarf from Saturn, who had a softer voice than\nMicromegas, told them in a few words what species they were dealing\nwith. He told them about the voyage from Saturn, brought them up to\nspeed on what Mr. Micromegas was, and after lamenting how small they\nwere, asked them if they had always been in this miserable state so\nnear nothingness, what they were doing on a globe that appeared to\nbelong to whales, whether they were happy, if they reproduced, if\nthey had a soul, and a hundred other questions of this nature.\nA reasoner among the troop, more daring than the others, and shocked\nthat someone might doubt his soul, observed the interlocutor with\nsight-vanes pointed at a quarter circle from two different stations,\nand at the third spoke thusly: \"You believe then, Sir, that because\nyou are a thousand fathoms tall from head to toe, that you are a--\"\n\"A thousand fathoms!\" cried the dwarf. \"Good heavens! How could he\nknow my height? A thousand fathoms! You cannot mistake him for a\nflea. This atom just measured me! He is a surveyor, he knows my size;\nand I, who can only see him through a microscope, I still do not know\nhis!\"\n\"Yes, I measured you,\" said the physician, \"and I will measure your\nlarge companion as well.\" The proposition was accepted, his\nexcellency laid down flat; for were he to stay upright his head would\nhave been among the clouds. Our philosophers planted a great shaft on\nhim, in a place that doctor Swift would have named, but that I will\nrestrain myself from calling by its name, out of respect for the\nladies. Next, by a series of triangles linked together, they\nconcluded that what they saw was in effect a young man of 120,000\nfeet[1].\n[1]The edition I believe to be original reads, \"a beautiful\nyoung ... of 120,000 feet.\"  B.\nSo Micromegas delivered these words: \"I see more than ever that one\nmust not judge anything by its apparent size. Oh God! you who have\ngiven intelligence to substance that appears contemptible. The\ninfinitely small costs you as little as the infinitely large; and if\nit is possible that there are such small beings as these, there may\njust as well be a spirit bigger than those of the superb animals that\nI have seen in the heavens, whose feet alone would cover this\nplanet.\"\nOne of the philosophers responded that he could certainly imagine\nthat there are intelligent beings much smaller than man. He\nrecounted, not every fabulous thing Virgil says about bees, but what\nSwammerdam discovered, and what R\u00e9aumur has anatomized. He explained\nfinally that there are animals that are to bees what bees are to man,\nwhat the Sirian himself was for the vast animals he had spoken of,\nand what these large animals are to other substances before which\nthey looked like atoms. Little by little the conversation became\ninteresting, and Micromegas spoke thusly:\nCHAPTER VII.\nConversation with the men.\n\"Oh intelligent atoms, in which the Eternal Being desired to make\nmanifest his skill and his power, you must, no doubt, taste pure joys\non your planet; for having so little matter, and appearing to be\nentirely spirit, you must live out your life thinking and loving, the\nveritable life of the mind. Nowhere have I seen true bliss, but it is\nhere, without a doubt.\"\nAt this all the philosophers shook their heads, and one of them, more\nfrank than the others, avowed that if one excepts a small number of\ninhabitants held in poor regard, all the rest are an assembly of mad,\nvicious, and wretched people. \"We have more substance than is\nnecessary,\" he said, \"to do evil, if evil comes from substance; and\ntoo much spirit, if evil comes from spirit. Did you know, for\nexample, that as I am speaking with you[1], there are 100,000 madmen\nof our species wearing hats, killing 100,000 other animals wearing\nturbans, or being massacred by them, and that we have used almost\nsurface of the Earth for this purpose since time immemorial?\"\n[1] We saw, at the end of chapter III, that the story occurs in\n1737. Voltaire is referring to the war between the Turks and the\nRussians, from 1736 to 1739.  B.\nThe Sirian shuddered, and asked the reason for these horrible\nquarrels between such puny animals.\n\"It is a matter,\" said the philosopher, \"of some piles of mud as big\nas your heel[2]. It is not that any of these millions of men that\nslit each other's throats care about this pile of mud. It is only a\nmatter of determining if it should belong to a certain man who we\ncall 'Sultan,' or to another who we call, for whatever reason,\n'Czar.' Neither one has ever seen nor will ever see the little piece\nof Earth, and almost none of these animals that mutually kill\nthemselves have ever seen the animal for which they kill.\"\n[2] Crimea, which all the same was not reunited with Russia until\n1783.  B.\n\"Oh! Cruel fate!\" cried the Sirian with indignation, \"who could\nconceive of this excess of maniacal rage! It makes me want to take\nthree steps and crush this whole anthill of ridiculous assassins.\"\n\"Do not waste your time,\" someone responded, \"they are working\ntowards ruin quickly enough. Know that after ten years only one\nhundredth of these scoundrels will be here. Know that even if they\nhave not drawn swords, hunger, fatigue, or intemperance will overtake\nthem. Furthermore, it is not they that should be punished, it is\nthose sedentary barbarians who from the depths of their offices\norder, while they are digesting their last meal, the massacre of a\nmillion men, and who subsequently give solemn thanks to God.\"\nThe voyager was moved with pity for the small human race, where he\nwas discovering such surprising contrasts.\n\"Since you are amongst the small number of wise men,\" he told these\nsirs, \"and since apparently you do not kill anyone for money, tell\nme, I beg of you, what occupies your time.\"\n\"We dissect flies,\" said the philosopher, \"we measure lines, we\ngather figures; we agree with each other on two or three points that\nwe do not understand.\"\nIt suddenly took the Sirian and the Saturnian's fancy to question\nthese thinking atoms, to learn what it was they agreed on.\n\"What do you measure,\" said the Saturnian, \"from the Dog Star to the\ngreat star of the Gemini?\"\nThey responded all at once, \"thirty-two and a half degrees.\"\n\"What do you measure from here to the moon?\"\n\"60 radii of the Earth even.\"\n\"How much does your air weigh?\"\nHe thought he had caught them[3], but they all told him that air\nweighed around 900 times less than an identical volume of the purest\nwater, and 19,000 times less than a gold ducat. The little dwarf from\nSaturn, surprised at their responses, was tempted to accuse of\nwitchcraft the same people he had refused a soul fifteen minutes\nearlier.\n[3] The edition I believe to be original reads \"put them off\" in\nplace of \"caught them.\"\nFinally Micromegas said to them, \"Since you know what is exterior to\nyou so well, you must know what is interior even better. Tell me what\nyour soul is, and how you form ideas.\" The philosophers spoke all at\nonce as before, but they were of different views. The oldest cited\nAristotle, another pronounced the name of Descartes; this one here,\nMalebranche; another Leibnitz; another Locke. An old peripatetic\nspoke up with confidence: \"The soul is an entelechy, and a reason\ngives it the power to be what it is.\" This is what Aristotle\nexpressly declares, page 633 of the Louvre edition. He cited the\npassage[4].\n[4] Here is the passage such as it is transcribed in the edition\ndated 1750: \"Entele'xeia' tis esi kai' lo'gos to\u00fb dy'namin\ne'xontos toude' ei'nai.\"\nThis passage of Aristotle, _On the Soul_, book II, chapter II, is\ntranslated thusly by Casaubon: _Anima quaedam perfectio et actus\nac ratio est quod potentiam habet ut ejusmodi sit_.  B.\n\"I do not understand Greek very well,\" said the giant.\n\"Neither do I,\" said the philosophical mite.\n\"Why then,\" the Sirian retorted, \"are you citing some man named\nAristotle in the Greek?\"\n\"Because,\" replied the savant, \"one should always cite what one does\nnot understand at all in the language one understands the least.\"\nThe Cartesian took the floor and said: \"The soul is a pure spirit\nthat has received in the belly of its mother all metaphysical ideas,\nand which, leaving that place, is obliged to go to school, and to\nlearn all over again what it already knew, and will not know again.\"\n\"It is not worth the trouble,\" responded the animal with the height\nof eight leagues, \"for your soul to be so knowledgeable in its\nmother's stomach, only to be so ignorant when you have hair on your\nchin. But what do you understand by the mind?\"\n\"You are asking me?\" said the reasoner. \"I have no idea. We say that\nit is not matter--\"\n\"But do you at least know what matter is?\"\n\"Certainly,\" replied the man. \"For example this stone is grey, has\nsuch and such a form, has three dimensions, is heavy and divisible.\"\n\"Well!\" said the Sirian, \"this thing that appears to you to be\ndivisible, heavy, and grey, will you tell me what it is? You see some\nattributes, but behind those, are you familiar with that?\n\"No,\" said the other.\n\"--So you do not know what matter is.\"\nSo Micromegas, addressing another sage that he held on a thumb, asked\nwhat his soul was, and what it did.\n\"Nothing at all,\" said the Malebranchist philosopher[5]. \"God does\neverything for me. I see everything in him, I do everything in him;\nit is he who does everything that I get mixed up in.\"\n[5] See the opuscule entitled \"All in God\" in _Miscellaneous_\n(1796).\n\"It would be just as well not to exist,\" retorted the sage of Sirius.\n\"And you, my friend,\" he said to a Leibnitzian who was there, \"what\nis your soul?\"\n\"It is,\" answered the Leibnitzian, \"the hand of a clock that tells\nthe time while my body rings out. Or, if you like, it is my soul that\nrings out while my body tells the time, or my soul is the mirror of\nthe universe, and my body is the border of the mirror. All that is\nclear.\"\nA small partisan of Locke was nearby, and when he was finally given\nthe floor: \"I do not know,\" said he, \"how I think, but I know that I\nhave only ever thought through my senses. That there are immaterial\nand intelligent substances I do not doubt, but that it is impossible\nfor God to communicate thought to matter I doubt very much. I revere\nthe eternal power. It is not my place to limit it. I affirm nothing,\nand content myself with believing that many more things are possible\nthan one would think.\"\nThe animal from Sirius smiled. He did not find this the least bit\nsage, while the dwarf from Saturn would have kissed the sectarian of\nLocke were it not for the extreme disproportion. But there was,\nunfortunately, a little animalcule in a square hat who interrupted\nall the other animalcule philosophers. He said that he knew the\nsecret: that everything would be found in the _Summa_ of Saint\nThomas. He looked the two celestial inhabitants up and down. He\nargued that their people, their worlds, their suns, their stars, had\nall been made uniquely for mankind. At this speech, our two voyagers\nnearly fell over with that inextinguishable laughter which, according\nto Homer[6], is shared with the gods. Their shoulders and their\nstomachs heaved up and down, and in these convulsions the vessel that\nthe Sirian had on his nail fell into one of the Saturnian's trouser\npockets. These two good men searched for it a long time, found it\nfinally, and tidied it up neatly. The Sirian resumed his discussion\nwith the little mites. He spoke to them with great kindness, although\nin the depths of his heart he was a little angry that the infinitely\nsmall had an almost infinitely great pride. He promised to make them\na beautiful philosophical book[7], written very small for their\nusage, and said that in this book they would see the point of\neverything. Indeed, he gave them this book before leaving. It was\ntaken to the academy of science in Paris, but when the ancient[8]\nsecretary opened it, he saw nothing but blank pages. \"Ah!\" he said,\n\"I suspected as much.\"\n[6] Illiad, I, 599.  B.\n[7] The edition that I believe to be original, and the one dated\n1750, reads, \"philosophical book, that would teach them of\nadmirable things, and show them the goodness of things.\"\n[8] Although this scene occurs in 1737, as one saw in pages 177 to\n188, one could assign the epithet of \"old\" to Fontenelle, who was\n80 at that point, and who died 20 years later. In 1740 he resigned\nfrom his position as perpetual secretary.\nEND OF THE HISTORY OF MICROMEGAS.", "source": "micromegas.txt"}
{"text": "LETTER I.--ON THE QUAKERS\nI was of opinion that the doctrine and history of so extraordinary a\npeople were worthy the attention of the curious.  To acquaint myself with\nthem I made a visit to one of the most eminent Quakers in England, who,\nafter having traded thirty years, had the wisdom to prescribe limits to\nhis fortune and to his desires, and was settled in a little solitude not\nfar from London.  Being come into it, I perceived a small but regularly\nbuilt house, vastly neat, but without the least pomp of furniture.  The\nQuaker who owned it was a hale, ruddy-complexioned old man, who had never\nbeen afflicted with sickness because he had always been insensible to\npassions, and a perfect stranger to intemperance.  I never in my life saw\na more noble or a more engaging aspect than his.  He was dressed like\nthose of his persuasion, in a plain coat without pleats in the sides, or\nbuttons on the pockets and sleeves; and had on a beaver, the brims of\nwhich were horizontal like those of our clergy.  He did not uncover\nhimself when I appeared, and advanced towards me without once stooping\nhis body; but there appeared more politeness in the open, humane air of\nhis countenance, than in the custom of drawing one leg behind the other,\nand taking that from the head which is made to cover it.  \"Friend,\" says\nhe to me, \"I perceive thou art a stranger, but if I can do anything for\nthee, only tell me.\"  \"Sir,\" said I to him, bending forwards and\nadvancing, as is usual with us, one leg towards him, \"I flatter myself\nthat my just curiosity will not give you the least offence, and that\nyou'll do me the honour to inform me of the particulars of your\nreligion.\"  \"The people of thy country,\" replied the Quaker, \"are too\nfull of their bows and compliments, but I never yet met with one of them\nwho had so much curiosity as thyself.  Come in, and let us first dine\ntogether.\"  I still continued to make some very unseasonable ceremonies,\nit not being easy to disengage one's self at once from habits we have\nbeen long used to; and after taking part in a frugal meal, which began\nand ended with a prayer to God, I began to question my courteous host.  I\nopened with that which good Catholics have more than once made to\nHuguenots.  \"My dear sir,\" said I, \"were you ever baptised?\"  \"I never\nwas,\" replied the Quaker, \"nor any of my brethren.\"  \"Zounds!\" say I to\nhim, \"you are not Christians, then.\"  \"Friend,\" replies the old man in a\nsoft tone of voice, \"swear not; we are Christians, and endeavour to be\ngood Christians, but we are not of opinion that the sprinkling water on a\nchild's head makes him a Christian.\"  \"Heavens!\" say I, shocked at his\nimpiety, \"you have then forgot that Christ was baptised by St. John.\"\n\"Friend,\" replies the mild Quaker once again, \"swear not; Christ indeed\nwas baptised by John, but He himself never baptised anyone.  We are the\ndisciples of Christ, not of John.\"  I pitied very much the sincerity of\nmy worthy Quaker, and was absolutely for forcing him to get himself\nchristened.  \"Were that all,\" replied he very gravely, \"we would submit\ncheerfully to baptism, purely in compliance with thy weakness, for we\ndon't condemn any person who uses it; but then we think that those who\nprofess a religion of so holy, so spiritual a nature as that of Christ,\nought to abstain to the utmost of their power from the Jewish\nceremonies.\"  \"O unaccountable!\" say I: \"what! baptism a Jewish\nceremony?\"  \"Yes, my friend,\" says he, \"so truly Jewish, that a great\nmany Jews use the baptism of John to this day.  Look into ancient\nauthors, and thou wilt find that John only revived this practice; and\nthat it had been used by the Hebrews, long before his time, in like\nmanner as the Mahometans imitated the Ishmaelites in their pilgrimages to\nMecca.  Jesus indeed submitted to the baptism of John, as He had suffered\nHimself to be circumcised; but circumcision and the washing with water\nought to be abolished by the baptism of Christ, that baptism of the\nSpirit, that ablution of the soul, which is the salvation of mankind.\nThus the forerunner said, 'I indeed baptise you with water unto\nrepentance; but He that cometh after me is mightier than I, whose shoes I\nam not worthy to bear: he shall baptise you with the Holy Ghost and with\nfire.'  Likewise Paul, the great apostle of the Gentiles, writes as\nfollows to the Corinthians, 'Christ sent me not to baptise, but to preach\nthe Gospel;' and indeed Paul never baptised but two persons with water,\nand that very much against his inclinations.  He circumcised his disciple\nTimothy, and the other disciples likewise circumcised all who were\nwilling to submit to that carnal ordinance.  But art thou circumcised?\"\nadded he.  \"I have not the honour to be so,\" say I.  \"Well, friend,\"\ncontinues the Quaker, \"thou art a Christian without being circumcised,\nand I am one without being baptised.\"  Thus did this pious man make a\nwrong but very specious application of four or five texts of Scripture\nwhich seemed to favour the tenets of his sect; but at the same time\nforgot very sincerely an hundred texts which made directly against them.\nI had more sense than to contest with him, since there is no possibility\nof convincing an enthusiast.  A man should never pretend to inform a\nlover of his mistress's faults, no more than one who is at law, of the\nbadness of his cause; nor attempt to win over a fanatic by strength of\nreasoning.  Accordingly I waived the subject.\n\"Well,\" said I to him, \"what sort of a communion have you?\"  \"We have\nnone like that thou hintest at among us,\" replied he.  \"How! no\ncommunion?\" said I.  \"Only that spiritual one,\" replied he, \"of hearts.\"\nHe then began again to throw out his texts of Scripture; and preached a\nmost eloquent sermon against that ordinance.  He harangued in a tone as\nthough he had been inspired, to prove that the sacraments were merely of\nhuman invention, and that the word \"sacrament\" was not once mentioned in\nthe Gospel.  \"Excuse,\" said he, \"my ignorance, for I have not employed a\nhundredth part of the arguments which might be brought to prove the truth\nof our religion, but these thou thyself mayest peruse in the Exposition\nof our Faith written by Robert Barclay.  It is one of the best pieces\nthat ever was penned by man; and as our adversaries confess it to be of\ndangerous tendency, the arguments in it must necessarily be very\nconvincing.\"  I promised to peruse this piece, and my Quaker imagined he\nhad already made a convert of me.  He afterwards gave me an account in\nfew words of some singularities which make this sect the contempt of\nothers.  \"Confess,\" said he, \"that it was very difficult for thee to\nrefrain from laughter, when I answered all thy civilities without\nuncovering my head, and at the same time said 'thee' and 'thou' to thee.\nHowever, thou appearest to me too well read not to know that in Christ's\ntime no nation was so ridiculous as to put the plural number for the\nsingular.  Augustus Caesar himself was spoken to in such phrases as\nthese: 'I love thee,' 'I beseech thee,' 'I thank thee;' but he did not\nallow any person to call him 'Domine,' sir.  It was not till many ages\nafter that men would have the word 'you,' as though they were double,\ninstead of 'thou' employed in speaking to them; and usurped the\nflattering titles of lordship, of eminence, and of holiness, which mere\nworms bestow on other worms by assuring them that they are with a most\nprofound respect, and an infamous falsehood, their most obedient humble\nservants.  It is to secure ourselves more strongly from such a shameless\ntraffic of lies and flattery, that we 'thee' and 'thou' a king with the\nsame freedom as we do a beggar, and salute no person; we owing nothing to\nmankind but charity, and to the laws respect and obedience.\n\"Our apparel is also somewhat different from that of others, and this\npurely, that it may be a perpetual warning to us not to imitate them.\nOthers wear the badges and marks of their several dignities, and we those\nof Christian humility.  We fly from all assemblies of pleasure, from\ndiversions of every kind, and from places where gaming is practised; and\nindeed our case would be very deplorable, should we fill with such\nlevities as those I have mentioned the heart which ought to be the\nhabitation of God.  We never swear, not even in a court of justice, being\nof opinion that the most holy name of God ought not to be prostituted in\nthe miserable contests betwixt man and man.  When we are obliged to\nappear before a magistrate upon other people's account (for law-suits are\nunknown among the Friends), we give evidence to the truth by sealing it\nwith our yea or nay; and the judges believe us on our bare affirmation,\nwhilst so many other Christians forswear themselves on the holy Gospels.\nWe never war or fight in any case; but it is not that we are afraid, for\nso far from shuddering at the thoughts of death, we on the contrary bless\nthe moment which unites us with the Being of Beings; but the reason of\nour not using the outward sword is, that we are neither wolves, tigers,\nnor mastiffs, but men and Christians.  Our God, who has commanded us to\nlove our enemies, and to suffer without repining, would certainly not\npermit us to cross the seas, merely because murderers clothed in scarlet,\nand wearing caps two foot high, enlist citizens by a noise made with two\nlittle sticks on an ass's skin extended.  And when, after a victory is\ngained, the whole city of London is illuminated; when the sky is in a\nblaze with fireworks, and a noise is heard in the air, of thanksgivings,\nof bells, of organs, and of the cannon, we groan in silence, and are\ndeeply affected with sadness of spirit and brokenness of heart, for the\nsad havoc which is the occasion of those public rejoicings.\"\nLETTER II.--ON THE QUAKERS\nSuch was the substance of the conversation I had with this very singular\nperson; but I was greatly surprised to see him come the Sunday following\nand take me with him to the Quakers' meeting.  There are several of these\nin London, but that which he carried me to stands near the famous pillar\ncalled The Monument.  The brethren were already assembled at my entering\nit with my guide.  There might be about four hundred men and three\nhundred women in the meeting.  The women hid their faces behind their\nfans, and the men were covered with their broad-brimmed hats.  All were\nseated, and the silence was universal.  I passed through them, but did\nnot perceive so much as one lift up his eyes to look at me.  This silence\nlasted a quarter of an hour, when at last one of them rose up, took off\nhis hat, and, after making a variety of wry faces and groaning in a most\nlamentable manner, he, partly from his nose and partly from his mouth,\nthrew out a strange, confused jumble of words (borrowed, as he imagined,\nfrom the Gospel) which neither himself nor any of his hearers understood.\nWhen this distorter had ended his beautiful soliloquy, and that the\nstupid, but greatly edified, congregation were separated, I asked my\nfriend how it was possible for the judicious part of their assembly to\nsuffer such a babbling?  \"We are obliged,\" says he, \"to suffer it,\nbecause no one knows when a man rises up to hold forth whether he will be\nmoved by the Spirit or by folly.  In this doubt and uncertainty we listen\npatiently to everyone; we even allow our women to hold forth.  Two or\nthree of these are often inspired at one and the same time, and it is\nthen that a most charming noise is heard in the Lord's house.\"  \"You\nhave, then, no priests?\" say I to him.  \"No, no, friend,\" replies the\nQuaker, \"to our great happiness.\"  Then opening one of the Friends'\nbooks, as he called it, he read the following words in an emphatic\ntone:--\"'God forbid we should presume to ordain anyone to receive the\nHoly Spirit on the Lord's Day to the prejudice of the rest of the\nbrethren.'  Thanks to the Almighty, we are the only people upon earth\nthat have no priests.  Wouldst thou deprive us of so happy a distinction?\nWhy should we abandon our babe to mercenary nurses, when we ourselves\nhave milk enough for it?  These mercenary creatures would soon domineer\nin our houses and destroy both the mother and the babe.  God has said,\n'Freely you have received, freely give.'  Shall we, after these words,\ncheapen, as it were, the Gospel, sell the Holy Ghost, and make of an\nassembly of Christians a mere shop of traders?  We don't pay a set of men\nclothed in black to assist our poor, to bury our dead, or to preach to\nthe brethren.  These offices are all of too tender a nature for us ever\nto entrust them to others.\"  \"But how is it possible for you,\" said I,\nwith some warmth, \"to know whether your discourse is really inspired by\nthe Almighty?\"  \"Whosoever,\" says he, \"shall implore Christ to enlighten\nhim, and shall publish the Gospel truths he may feel inwardly, such an\none may be assured that he is inspired by the Lord.\"  He then poured\nforth a numberless multitude of Scripture texts which proved, as he\nimagined, that there is no such thing as Christianity without an\nimmediate revelation, and added these remarkable words: \"When thou movest\none of thy limbs, is it moved by thy own power?  Certainly not; for this\nlimb is often sensible to involuntary motions.  Consequently he who\ncreated thy body gives motion to this earthly tabernacle.  And are the\nseveral ideas of which thy soul receives the impression formed by\nthyself?  Much less are they, since these pour in upon thy mind whether\nthou wilt or no; consequently thou receivest thy ideas from Him who\ncreated thy soul.  But as He leaves thy affections at full liberty, He\ngives thy mind such ideas as thy affections may deserve; if thou livest\nin God, thou actest, thou thinkest in God.  After this thou needest only\nbut open thine eyes to that light which enlightens all mankind, and it is\nthen thou wilt perceive the truth, and make others perceive it.\"  \"Why,\nthis,\" said I, \"is Malebranche's doctrine to a tittle.\"  \"I am acquainted\nwith thy Malebranche,\" said he; \"he had something of the Friend in him,\nbut was not enough so.\"  These are the most considerable particulars I\nlearnt concerning the doctrine of the Quakers.  In my next letter I shall\nacquaint you with their history, which you will find more singular than\ntheir opinions.\nLETTER III.--ON THE QUAKERS\nYou have already heard that the Quakers date from Christ, who, according\nto them, was the first Quaker.  Religion, say these, was corrupted a\nlittle after His death, and remained in that state of corruption about\nsixteen hundred years.  But there were always a few Quakers concealed in\nthe world, who carefully preserved the sacred fire, which was\nextinguished in all but themselves, until at last this light spread\nitself in England in 1642.\nIt was at the time when Great Britain was torn to pieces by the intestine\nwars which three or four sects had raised in the name of God, that one\nGeorge Fox, born in Leicestershire, and son to a silk-weaver, took it\ninto his head to preach, and, as he pretended, with all the requisites of\na true apostle--that is, without being able either to read or write.  He\nwas about twenty-five years of age, irreproachable in his life and\nconduct, and a holy madman.  He was equipped in leather from head to\nfoot, and travelled from one village to another, exclaiming against war\nand the clergy.  Had his invectives been levelled against the soldiery\nonly he would have been safe enough, but he inveighed against\necclesiastics.  Fox was seized at Derby, and being carried before a\njustice of peace, he did not once offer to pull off his leathern hat,\nupon which an officer gave him a great box of the ear, and cried to him,\n\"Don't you know you are to appear uncovered before his worship?\"  Fox\npresented his other cheek to the officer, and begged him to give him\nanother box for God's sake.  The justice would have had him sworn before\nhe asked him any questions.  \"Know, friend,\" says Fox to him, \"that I\nnever swear.\"  The justice, observing he \"thee'd\" and \"thou'd\" him, sent\nhim to the House of Correction, in Derby, with orders that he should be\nwhipped there.  Fox praised the Lord all the way he went to the House of\nCorrection, where the justice's order was executed with the utmost\nseverity.  The men who whipped this enthusiast were greatly surprised to\nhear him beseech them to give him a few more lashes for the good of his\nsoul.  There was no need of entreating these people; the lashes were\nrepeated, for which Fox thanked them very cordially, and began to preach.\nAt first the spectators fell a-laughing, but they afterwards listened to\nhim; and as enthusiasm is an epidemical distemper, many were persuaded,\nand those who scourged him became his first disciples.  Being set at\nliberty, he ran up and down the country with a dozen proselytes at his\nheels, still declaiming against the clergy, and was whipped from time to\ntime.  Being one day set in the pillory, he harangued the crowd in so\nstrong and moving a manner, that fifty of the auditors became his\nconverts, and he won the rest so much in his favour that, his head being\nfreed tumultuously from the hole where it was fastened, the populace went\nand searched for the Church of England clergyman who had been chiefly\ninstrumental in bringing him to this punishment, and set him on the same\npillory where Fox had stood.\nFox was bold enough to convert some of Oliver Cromwell's soldiers, who\nthereupon quitted the service and refused to take the oaths.  Oliver,\nhaving as great a contempt for a sect which would not allow its members\nto fight, as Sixtus Quintus had for another sect, _Dove non si chiamava_,\nbegan to persecute these new converts.  The prisons were crowded with\nthem, but persecution seldom has any other effect than to increase the\nnumber of proselytes.  These came, therefore, from their confinement more\nstrongly confirmed in the principles they had imbibed, and followed by\ntheir gaolers, whom they had brought over to their belief.  But the\ncircumstances which contributed chiefly to the spreading of this sect\nwere as follows:--Fox thought himself inspired, and consequently was of\nopinion that he must speak in a manner different from the rest of\nmankind.  He thereupon began to writhe his body, to screw up his face, to\nhold in his breath, and to exhale it in a forcible manner, insomuch that\nthe priestess of the Pythian god at Delphos could not have acted her part\nto better advantage.  Inspiration soon became so habitual to him that he\ncould scarce deliver himself in any other manner.  This was the first\ngift he communicated to his disciples.  These aped very sincerely their\nmaster's several grimaces, and shook in every limb the instant the fit of\ninspiration came upon them, whence they were called Quakers.  The vulgar\nattempted to mimic them; they trembled, they spake through the nose, they\nquaked and fancied themselves inspired by the Holy Ghost.  The only thing\nnow wanting was a few miracles, and accordingly they wrought some.\nFox, this modern patriarch, spoke thus to a justice of peace before a\nlarge assembly of people: \"Friend, take care what thou dost; God will\nsoon punish thee for persecuting His saints.\"  This magistrate, being one\nwho besotted himself every day with bad beer and brandy, died of an\napoplexy two days after, the moment he had signed a _mittimus_ for\nimprisoning some Quakers.  The sudden death with which this justice was\nseized was not ascribed to his intemperance, but was universally looked\nupon as the effect of the holy man's predictions; so that this accident\nmade more converts to Quakerism than a thousand sermons and as many\nshaking fits could have done.  Oliver, finding them increase daily, was\ndesirous of bringing them over to his party, and for that purpose\nattempted to bribe them by money.  However, they were incorruptible,\nwhich made him one day declare that this religion was the only one he had\never met with that had resisted the charms of gold.\nThe Quakers were several times persecuted under Charles II.; not upon a\nreligious account, but for refusing to pay the tithes, for \"theeing\" and\n\"thouing\" the magistrates, and for refusing to take the oaths enacted by\nthe laws.\nAt last Robert Barclay, a native of Scotland, presented to the King, in\n1675, his \"Apology for the Quakers,\" a work as well drawn up as the\nsubject could possibly admit.  The dedication to Charles II. is not\nfilled with mean, flattering encomiums, but abounds with bold touches in\nfavour of truth and with the wisest counsels.  \"Thou hast tasted,\" says\nhe to the King at the close of his epistle dedicatory, \"of prosperity and\nadversity; thou knowest what it is to be banished thy native country; to\nbe overruled as well as to rule and sit upon the throne; and, being\noppressed, thou hast reason to know how hateful the Oppressor is both to\nGod and man.  If, after all these warnings and advertisements, thou dost\nnot turn unto the Lord with all thy heart, but forget Him who remembered\nthee in thy distress, and give up thyself to follow lust and vanity,\nsurely great will be thy condemnation.\n\"Against which snare, as well as the temptation of those that may or do\nfeed thee and prompt thee to evil, the most excellent and prevalent\nremedy will be, to apply thyself to that light of Christ which shineth in\nthy conscience, which neither can nor will flatter thee nor suffer thee\nto be at ease in thy sins, but doth and will deal plainly and faithfully\nwith thee, as those that are followers thereof have plainly done.--Thy\nfaithful friend and subject, Robert Barclay.\"\nA more surprising circumstance is, that this epistle, written by a\nprivate man of no figure, was so happy in its effects, as to put a stop\nto the persecution.\nLETTER IV.--ON THE QUAKERS\nAbout this time arose the illustrious William Penn, who established the\npower of the Quakers in America, and would have made them appear\nvenerable in the eyes of the Europeans, were it possible for mankind to\nrespect virtue when revealed in a ridiculous light.  He was the only son\nof Vice-Admiral Penn, favourite of the Duke of York, afterwards King\nJames II.\nWilliam Penn, at twenty years of age, happening to meet with a Quaker in\nCork, whom he had known at Oxford, this man made a proselyte of him; and\nWilliam being a sprightly youth, and naturally eloquent, having a winning\naspect, and a very engaging carriage, he soon gained over some of his\nintimates.  He carried matters so far, that he formed by insensible\ndegrees a society of young Quakers, who met at his house; so that he was\nat the head of a sect when a little above twenty.\nBeing returned, after his leaving Cork, to the Vice-Admiral his father,\ninstead of falling upon his knees to ask his blessing, he went up to him\nwith his hat on, and said, \"Friend, I am very glad to see thee in good\nhealth.\"  The Vice-Admiral imagined his son to be crazy, but soon finding\nhe was turned Quaker, he employed all the methods that prudence could\nsuggest to engage him to behave and act like other people.  The youth\nmade no other answer to his father, than by exhorting him to turn Quaker\nalso.  At last his father confined himself to this single request, viz.,\n\"that he should wait upon the King and the Duke of York with his hat\nunder his arm, and should not 'thee' and 'thou' them.\"  William answered,\n\"that he could not do these things, for conscience' sake,\" which\nexasperated his father to such a degree, that he turned him out of doors.\nYoung Pen gave God thanks for permitting him to suffer so early in His\ncause, after which he went into the city, where he held forth, and made a\ngreat number of converts.\nThe Church of England clergy found their congregations dwindle away\ndaily; and Penn being young, handsome, and of a graceful stature, the\ncourt as well as the city ladies flocked very devoutly to his meeting.\nThe patriarch, George Fox, hearing of his great reputation, came to\nLondon (though the journey was very long) purely to see and converse with\nhim.  Both resolved to go upon missions into foreign countries, and\naccordingly they embarked for Holland, after having left labourers\nsufficient to take care of the London vineyard.\nTheir labours were crowned with success in Amsterdam, but a circumstance\nwhich reflected the greatest honour on them, and at the same time put\ntheir humility to the greatest trial, was the reception they met with\nfrom Elizabeth, the Princess Palatine, aunt to George I. of Great\nBritain, a lady conspicuous for her genius and knowledge, and to whom\nDescartes had dedicated his Philosophical Romance.\nShe was then retired to the Hague, where she received these Friends, for\nso the Quakers were at that time called in Holland.  This princess had\nseveral conferences with them in her palace, and she at last entertained\nso favourable an opinion of Quakerism, that they confessed she was not\nfar from the kingdom of heaven.  The Friends sowed likewise the good seed\nin Germany, but reaped very little fruit; for the mode of \"theeing\" and\n\"thouing\" was not approved of in a country where a man is perpetually\nobliged to employ the titles of \"highness\" and \"excellency.\"  William\nPenn returned soon to England upon hearing of his father's sickness, in\norder to see him before he died.  The Vice-Admiral was reconciled to his\nson, and though of a different persuasion, embraced him tenderly.  William\nmade a fruitless exhortation to his father not to receive the sacrament,\nbut to die a Quaker, and the good old man entreated his son William to\nwear buttons on his sleeves, and a crape hatband in his beaver, but all\nto no purpose.\nWilliam Penn inherited very large possessions, part of which consisted in\nCrown debts due to the Vice-Admiral for sums he had advanced for the sea\nservice.  No moneys were at that time more insecure than those owing from\nthe king.  Penn was obliged to go more than once, and \"thee\" and \"thou\"\nKing Charles and his Ministers, in order to recover the debt; and at\nlast, instead of specie, the Government invested him with the right and\nsovereignty of a province of America, to the south of Maryland.  Thus was\na Quaker raised to sovereign power.  Penn set sail for his new dominions\nwith two ships freighted with Quakers, who followed his fortune.  The\ncountry was then called Pennsylvania from William Penn, who there founded\nPhiladelphia, now the most flourishing city in that country.  The first\nstep he took was to enter into an alliance with his American neighbours,\nand this is the only treaty between those people and the Christians that\nwas not ratified by an oath, and was never infringed.  The new sovereign\nwas at the same time the legislator of Pennsylvania, and enacted very\nwise and prudent laws, none of which have ever been changed since his\ntime.  The first is, to injure no person upon a religious account, and to\nconsider as brethren all those who believe in one God.\nHe had no sooner settled his government, but several American merchants\ncame and peopled this colony.  The natives of the country, instead of\nflying into the woods, cultivated by insensible degrees a friendship with\nthe peaceable Quakers.  They loved these foreigners as much as they\ndetested the other Christians who had conquered and laid waste America.\nIn a little time a great number of these savages (falsely so called),\ncharmed with the mild and gentle disposition of their neighbours, came in\ncrowds to William Penn, and besought him to admit them into the number of\nhis vassals.  It was very rare and uncommon for a sovereign to be\n\"thee'd\" and \"thou'd\" by the meanest of his subjects, who never took\ntheir hats off when they came into his presence; and as singular for a\nGovernment to be without one priest in it, and for a people to be without\narms, either offensive or defensive; for a body of citizens to be\nabsolutely undistinguished but by the public employments, and for\nneighbours not to entertain the least jealousy one against the other.\nWilliam Penn might glory in having brought down upon earth the so much\nboasted golden age, which in all probability never existed but in\nPennsylvania.  He returned to England to settle some affairs relating to\nhis new dominions.  After the death of King Charles II., King James, who\nhad loved the father, indulged the same affection to the son, and no\nlonger considered him as an obscure sectary, but as a very great man.  The\nking's politics on this occasion agreed with his inclinations.  He was\ndesirous of pleasing the Quakers by annulling the laws made against\nNonconformists, in order to have an opportunity, by this universal\ntoleration, of establishing the Romish religion.  All the sectarists in\nEngland saw the snare that was laid for them, but did not give into it;\nthey never failing to unite when the Romish religion, their common enemy,\nis to be opposed.  But Penn did not think himself bound in any manner to\nrenounce his principles, merely to favour Protestants to whom he was\nodious, in opposition to a king who loved him.  He had established a\nuniversal toleration with regard to conscience in America, and would not\nhave it thought that he intended to destroy it in Europe, for which\nreason he adhered so inviolably to King James, that a report prevailed\nuniversally of his being a Jesuit.  This calumny affected him very\nstrongly, and he was obliged to justify himself in print.  However, the\nunfortunate King James II., in whom, as in most princes of the Stuart\nfamily, grandeur and weakness were equally blended, and who, like them,\nas much overdid some things as he was short in others, lost his kingdom\nin a manner that is hardly to be accounted for.\nAll the English sectarists accepted from William III, and his Parliament\nthe toleration and indulgence which they had refused when offered by King\nJames.  It was then the Quakers began to enjoy, by virtue of the laws,\nthe several privileges they possess at this time.  Penn having at last\nseen Quakerism firmly established in his native country, went back to\nPennsylvania.  His own people and the Americans received him with tears\nof joy, as though he had been a father who was returned to visit his\nchildren.  All the laws had been religiously observed in his absence, a\ncircumstance in which no legislator had ever been happy but himself.\nAfter having resided some years in Pennsylvania he left it, but with\ngreat reluctance, in order to return to England, there to solicit some\nmatters in favour of the commerce of Pennsylvania.  But he never saw it\nagain, he dying in Ruscombe, in Berkshire, in 1718.\nI am not able to guess what fate Quakerism may have in America, but I\nperceive it dwindles away daily in England.  In all countries where\nliberty of conscience is allowed, the established religion will at last\nswallow up all the rest.  Quakers are disqualified from being members of\nParliament; nor can they enjoy any post or preferment, because an oath\nmust always be taken on these occasions, and they never swear.  They are\ntherefore reduced to the necessity of subsisting upon traffic.  Their\nchildren, whom the industry of their parents has enriched, are desirous\nof enjoying honours, of wearing buttons and ruffles; and quite ashamed of\nbeing called Quakers they become converts to the Church of England,\nmerely to be in the fashion.\nLETTER V.--ON THE CHURCH OF ENGLAND\nEngland is properly the country of sectarists.  _Multae sunt mansiones in\ndomo patris mei_ (in my Father's house are many mansions).  An\nEnglishman, as one to whom liberty is natural, may go to heaven his own\nway.\nNevertheless, though every one is permitted to serve God in whatever mode\nor fashion he thinks proper, yet their true religion, that in which a man\nmakes his fortune, is the sect of Episcopalians or Churchmen, called the\nChurch of England, or simply the Church, by way of eminence.  No person\ncan possess an employment either in England or Ireland unless he be\nranked among the faithful, that is, professes himself a member of the\nChurch of England.  This reason (which carries mathematical evidence with\nit) has converted such numbers of Dissenters of all persuasions, that not\na twentieth part of the nation is out of the pale of the Established\nChurch.  The English clergy have retained a great number of the Romish\nceremonies, and especially that of receiving, with a most scrupulous\nattention, their tithes.  They also have the pious ambition to aim at\nsuperiority.\nMoreover, they inspire very religiously their flock with a holy zeal\nagainst Dissenters of all denominations.  This zeal was pretty violent\nunder the Tories in the four last years of Queen Anne; but was productive\nof no greater mischief than the breaking the windows of some\nmeeting-houses and the demolishing of a few of them.  For religious rage\nceased in England with the civil wars, and was no more under Queen Anne\nthan the hollow noise of a sea whose billows still heaved, though so long\nafter the storm when the Whigs and Tories laid waste their native\ncountry, in the same manner as the Guelphs and Ghibelins formerly did\ntheirs.  It was absolutely necessary for both parties to call in religion\non this occasion; the Tories declared for Episcopacy, and the Whigs, as\nsome imagined, were for abolishing it; however, after these had got the\nupper hand, they contented themselves with only abridging it.\nAt the time when the Earl of Oxford and the Lord Bolingbroke used to\ndrink healths to the Tories, the Church of England considered those\nnoblemen as the defenders of its holy privileges.  The lower House of\nConvocation (a kind of House of Commons) composed wholly of the clergy,\nwas in some credit at that time; at least the members of it had the\nliberty to meet, to dispute on ecclesiastical matters, to sentence\nimpious books from time to time to the flames, that is, books written\nagainst themselves.  The Ministry which is now composed of Whigs does not\nso much as allow those gentlemen to assemble, so that they are at this\ntime reduced (in the obscurity of their respective parishes) to the\nmelancholy occupation of praying for the prosperity of the Government\nwhose tranquillity they would willingly disturb.  With regard to the\nbishops, who are twenty-six in all, they still have seats in the House of\nLords in spite of the Whigs, because the ancient abuse of considering\nthem as barons subsists to this day.  There is a clause, however, in the\noath which the Government requires from these gentlemen, that puts their\nChristian patience to a very great trial, viz., that they shall be of the\nChurch of England as by law established.  There are few bishops, deans,\nor other dignitaries, but imagine they are so _jure divino_; it is\nconsequently a great mortification to them to be obliged to confess that\nthey owe their dignity to a pitiful law enacted by a set of profane\nlaymen.  A learned monk (Father Courayer) wrote a book lately to prove\nthe validity and succession of English ordinations.  This book was forbid\nin France, but do you believe that the English Ministry were pleased with\nit?  Far from it.  Those wicked Whigs don't care a straw whether the\nepiscopal succession among them hath been interrupted or not, or whether\nBishop Parker was consecrated (as it is pretended) in a tavern or a\nchurch; for these Whigs are much better pleased that the Bishops should\nderive their authority from the Parliament than from the Apostles.  The\nLord Bolingbroke observed that this notion of divine right would only\nmake so many tyrants in lawn sleeves, but that the laws made so many\ncitizens.\nWith regard to the morals of the English clergy, they are more regular\nthan those of France, and for this reason.  All the clergy (a very few\nexcepted) are educated in the Universities of Oxford or Cambridge, far\nfrom the depravity and corruption which reign in the capital.  They are\nnot called to dignities till very late, at a time of life when men are\nsensible of no other passion but avarice, that is, when their ambition\ncraves a supply.  Employments are here bestowed both in the Church and\nthe army, as a reward for long services; and we never see youngsters made\nbishops or colonels immediately upon their laying aside the academical\ngown; and besides most of the clergy are married.  The stiff and awkward\nair contracted by them at the University, and the little familiarity the\nmen of this country have with the ladies, commonly oblige a bishop to\nconfine himself to, and rest contented with, his own.  Clergymen\nsometimes take a glass at the tavern, custom giving them a sanction on\nthis occasion; and if they fuddle themselves it is in a very serious\nmanner, and without giving the least scandal.\nThat fable-mixed kind of mortal (not to be defined), who is neither of\nthe clergy nor of the laity; in a word, the thing called _Abbe_ in\nFrance; is a species quite unknown in England.  All the clergy here are\nvery much upon the reserve, and most of them pedants.  When these are\ntold that in France young fellows famous for their dissoluteness, and\nraised to the highest dignities of the Church by female intrigues,\naddress the fair publicly in an amorous way, amuse themselves in writing\ntender love songs, entertain their friends very splendidly every night at\ntheir own houses, and after the banquet is ended withdraw to invoke the\nassistance of the Holy Ghost, and call themselves boldly the successors\nof the Apostles, they bless God for their being Protestants.  But these\nare shameless heretics, who deserve to be blown hence through the flames\nto old Nick, as Rabelais says, and for this reason I do not trouble\nmyself about them.\nLETTER VI.--ON THE PRESBYTERIANS\nThe Church of England is confined almost to the kingdom whence it\nreceived its name, and to Ireland, for Presbyterianism is the established\nreligion in Scotland.  This Presbyterianism is directly the same with\nCalvinism, as it was established in France, and is now professed at\nGeneva.  As the priests of this sect receive but very inconsiderable\nstipends from their churches, and consequently cannot emulate the\nsplendid luxury of bishops, they exclaim very naturally against honours\nwhich they can never attain to.  Figure to yourself the haughty Diogenes\ntrampling under foot the pride of Plato.  The Scotch Presbyterians are\nnot very unlike that proud though tattered reasoner.  Diogenes did not\nuse Alexander half so impertinently as these treated King Charles II.;\nfor when they took up arms in his cause in opposition to Oliver, who had\ndeceived them, they forced that poor monarch to undergo the hearing of\nthree or four sermons every day, would not suffer him to play, reduced\nhim to a state of penitence and mortification, so that Charles soon grew\nsick of these pedants, and accordingly eloped from them with as much joy\nas a youth does from school.\nA Church of England minister appears as another Cato in presence of a\njuvenile, sprightly French graduate, who bawls for a whole morning\ntogether in the divinity schools, and hums a song in chorus with ladies\nin the evening; but this Cato is a very spark when before a Scotch\nPresbyterian.  The latter affects a serious gait, puts on a sour look,\nwears a vastly broad-brimmed hat and a long cloak over a very short coat,\npreaches through the nose, and gives the name of the whore of Babylon to\nall churches where the ministers are so fortunate as to enjoy an annual\nrevenue of five or six thousand pounds, and where the people are weak\nenough to suffer this, and to give them the titles of my lord, your\nlordship, or your eminence.\nThese gentlemen, who have also some churches in England, introduced there\nthe mode of grave and severe exhortations.  To them is owing the\nsanctification of Sunday in the three kingdoms.  People are there\nforbidden to work or take any recreation on that day, in which the\nseverity is twice as great as that of the Romish Church.  No operas,\nplays, or concerts are allowed in London on Sundays, and even cards are\nso expressly forbidden that none but persons of quality, and those we\ncall the genteel, play on that day; the rest of the nation go either to\nchurch, to the tavern, or to see their mistresses.\nThough the Episcopal and Presbyterian sects are the two prevailing ones\nin Great Britain, yet all others are very welcome to come and settle in\nit, and live very sociably together, though most of their preachers hate\none another almost as cordially as a Jansenist damns a Jesuit.\nTake a view of the Royal Exchange in London, a place more venerable than\nmany courts of justice, where the representatives of all nations meet for\nthe benefit of mankind.  There the Jew, the Mahometan, and the Christian\ntransact together, as though they all professed the same religion, and\ngive the name of infidel to none but bankrupts.  There the Presbyterian\nconfides in the Anabaptist, and the Churchman depends on the Quaker's\nword.\nIf one religion only were allowed in England, the Government would very\npossibly become arbitrary; if there were but two, the people would cut\none another's throats; but as there are such a multitude, they all live\nhappy and in peace.\nLETTER VII.--ON THE SOCINIANS, OR ARIANS, OR ANTITRINITARIANS\nThere is a little sect here composed of clergymen, and of a few very\nlearned persons among the laity, who, though they do not call themselves\nArians or Socinians, do yet dissent entirely from St. Athanasius with\nregard to their notions of the Trinity, and declare very frankly that the\nFather is greater than the Son.\nDo you remember what is related of a certain orthodox bishop, who, in\norder to convince an emperor of the reality of consubstantiation, put his\nhand under the chin of the monarch's son, and took him by the nose in\npresence of his sacred majesty?  The emperor was going to order his\nattendants to throw the bishop out of the window, when the good old man\ngave him this handsome and convincing reason: \"Since your majesty,\" says\nhe, \"is angry when your son has not due respect shown him, what\npunishment do you think will God the Father inflict on those who refuse\nHis Son Jesus the titles due to Him?\"  The persons I just now mentioned\ndeclare that the holy bishop took a very wrong step, that his argument\nwas inconclusive, and that the emperor should have answered him thus:\n\"Know that there are two ways by which men may be wanting in respect to\nme--first, in not doing honour sufficient to my son; and, secondly, in\npaying him the same honour as to me.\"\nBe this as it will, the principles of Arius begin to revive, not only in\nEngland, but in Holland and Poland.  The celebrated Sir Isaac Newton\nhonoured this opinion so far as to countenance it.  This philosopher\nthought that the Unitarians argued more mathematically than we do.  But\nthe most sanguine stickler for Arianism is the illustrious Dr. Clark.\nThis man is rigidly virtuous, and of a mild disposition, is more fond of\nhis tenets than desirous of propagating them, and absorbed so entirely in\nproblems and calculations that he is a mere reasoning machine.\nIt is he who wrote a book which is much esteemed and little understood,\non the existence of God, and another, more intelligible, but pretty much\ncontemned, on the truth of the Christian religion.\nHe never engaged in scholastic disputes, which our friend calls venerable\ntrifles.  He only published a work containing all the testimonies of the\nprimitive ages for and against the Unitarians, and leaves to the reader\nthe counting of the voices and the liberty of forming a judgment.  This\nbook won the doctor a great number of partisans, and lost him the See of\nCanterbury; but, in my humble opinion, he was out in his calculation, and\nhad better have been Primate of all England than merely an Arian parson.\nYou see that opinions are subject to revolutions as well as empires.\nArianism, after having triumphed during three centuries, and been forgot\ntwelve, rises at last out of its own ashes; but it has chosen a very\nimproper season to make its appearance in, the present age being quite\ncloyed with disputes and sects.  The members of this sect are, besides,\ntoo few to be indulged the liberty of holding public assemblies, which,\nhowever, they will, doubtless, be permitted to do in case they spread\nconsiderably.  But people are now so very cold with respect to all things\nof this kind, that there is little probability any new religion, or old\none, that may be revived, will meet with favour.  Is it not whimsical\nenough that Luther, Calvin, and Zuinglius, all of them wretched authors,\nshould have founded sects which are now spread over a great part of\nEurope, that Mahomet, though so ignorant, should have given a religion to\nAsia and Africa, and that Sir Isaac Newton, Dr. Clark, Mr. Locke, Mr. Le\nClerc, etc., the greatest philosophers, as well as the ablest writers of\ntheir ages, should scarcely have been able to raise a little flock, which\neven decreases daily.\nThis it is to be born at a proper period of time.  Were Cardinal de Retz\nto return again into the world, neither his eloquence nor his intrigues\nwould draw together ten women in Paris.\nWere Oliver Cromwell, he who beheaded his sovereign, and seized upon the\nkingly dignity, to rise from the dead, he would be a wealthy City trader,\nand no more.\nLETTER VIII.--ON THE PARLIAMENT\nThe members of the English Parliament are fond of comparing themselves to\nthe old Romans.\nNot long since Mr. Shippen opened a speech in the House of Commons with\nthese words, \"The majesty of the people of England would be wounded.\"  The\nsingularity of the expression occasioned a loud laugh; but this\ngentleman, so far from being disconcerted, repeated the same words with a\nresolute tone of voice, and the laugh ceased.  In my opinion, the majesty\nof the people of England has nothing in common with that of the people of\nRome, much less is there any affinity between their Governments.  There\nis in London a senate, some of the members whereof are accused (doubtless\nvery unjustly) of selling their voices on certain occasions, as was done\nin Rome; this is the only resemblance.  Besides, the two nations appear\nto me quite opposite in character, with regard both to good and evil.  The\nRomans never knew the dreadful folly of religious wars, an abomination\nreserved for devout preachers of patience and humility.  Marius and\nSylla, Caesar and Pompey, Anthony and Augustus, did not draw their swords\nand set the world in a blaze merely to determine whether the flamen\nshould wear his shirt over his robe, or his robe over his shirt, or\nwhether the sacred chickens should eat and drink, or eat only, in order\nto take the augury.  The English have hanged one another by law, and cut\none another to pieces in pitched battles, for quarrels of as trifling a\nnature.  The sects of the Episcopalians and Presbyterians quite\ndistracted these very serious heads for a time.  But I fancy they will\nhardly ever be so silly again, they seeming to be grown wiser at their\nown expense; and I do not perceive the least inclination in them to\nmurder one another merely about syllogisms, as some zealots among them\nonce did.\nBut here follows a more essential difference between Rome and England,\nwhich gives the advantage entirely to the latter--viz., that the civil\nwars of Rome ended in slavery, and those of the English in liberty.  The\nEnglish are the only people upon earth who have been able to prescribe\nlimits to the power of kings by resisting them; and who, by a series of\nstruggles, have at last established that wise Government where the Prince\nis all-powerful to do good, and, at the same time, is restrained from\ncommitting evil; where the nobles are great without insolence, though\nthere are no vassals; and where the people share in the Government\nwithout confusion.\nThe House of Lords and that of the Commons divide the legislative power\nunder the king, but the Romans had no such balance.  The patricians and\nplebeians in Rome were perpetually at variance, and there was no\nintermediate power to reconcile them.  The Roman senate, who were so\nunjustly, so criminally proud as not to suffer the plebeians to share\nwith them in anything, could find no other artifice to keep the latter\nout of the administration than by employing them in foreign wars.  They\nconsidered the plebeians as a wild beast, whom it behoved them to let\nloose upon their neighbours, for fear they should devour their masters.\nThus the greatest defect in the Government of the Romans raised them to\nbe conquerors.  By being unhappy at home, they triumphed over and\npossessed themselves of the world, till at last their divisions sunk them\nto slavery.\nThe Government of England will never rise to so exalted a pitch of glory,\nnor will its end be so fatal.  The English are not fired with the\nsplendid folly of making conquests, but would only prevent their\nneighbours from conquering.  They are not only jealous of their own\nliberty, but even of that of other nations.  The English were exasperated\nagainst Louis XIV. for no other reason but because he was ambitious, and\ndeclared war against him merely out of levity, not from any interested\nmotives.\nThe English have doubtless purchased their liberties at a very high\nprice, and waded through seas of blood to drown the idol of arbitrary\npower.  Other nations have been involved in as great calamities, and have\nshed as much blood; but then the blood they spilt in defence of their\nliberties only enslaved them the more.\nThat which rises to a revolution in England is no more than a sedition in\nother countries.  A city in Spain, in Barbary, or in Turkey, takes up\narms in defence of its privileges, when immediately it is stormed by\nmercenary troops, it is punished by executioners, and the rest of the\nnation kiss the chains they are loaded with.  The French are of opinion\nthat the government of this island is more tempestuous than the sea which\nsurrounds it, which indeed is true; but then it is never so but when the\nking raises the storm--when he attempts to seize the ship of which he is\nonly the chief pilot.  The civil wars of France lasted longer, were more\ncruel, and productive of greater evils than those of England; but none of\nthese civil wars had a wise and prudent liberty for their object.\nIn the detestable reigns of Charles IX. and Henry III. the whole affair\nwas only whether the people should be slaves to the Guises.  With regard\nto the last war of Paris, it deserves only to be hooted at.  Methinks I\nsee a crowd of schoolboys rising up in arms against their master, and\nafterwards whipped for it.  Cardinal de Retz, who was witty and brave\n(but to no purpose), rebellious without a cause, factious without design,\nand head of a defenceless party, caballed for caballing sake, and seemed\nto foment the civil war merely out of diversion.  The Parliament did not\nknow what he intended, nor what he did not intend.  He levied troops by\nAct of Parliament, and the next moment cashiered them.  He threatened, he\nbegged pardon; he set a price upon Cardinal Mazarin's head, and\nafterwards congratulated him in a public manner.  Our civil wars under\nCharles VI. were bloody and cruel, those of the League execrable, and\nthat of the Frondeurs ridiculous.\nThat for which the French chiefly reproach the English nation is the\nmurder of King Charles I., whom his subjects treated exactly as he would\nhave treated them had his reign been prosperous.  After all, consider on\none side Charles I., defeated in a pitched battle, imprisoned, tried,\nsentenced to die in Westminster Hall, and then beheaded.  And on the\nother, the Emperor Henry VII., poisoned by his chaplain at his receiving\nthe Sacrament; Henry III. stabbed by a monk; thirty assassinations\nprojected against Henry IV., several of them put in execution, and the\nlast bereaving that great monarch of his life.  Weigh, I say, all these\nwicked attempts, and then judge.\nLETTER IX.--ON THE GOVERNMENT\nThat mixture in the English Government, that harmony between King, Lords,\nand commons, did not always subsist.  England was enslaved for a long\nseries of years by the Romans, the Saxons, the Danes, and the French\nsuccessively.  William the Conqueror particularly, ruled them with a rod\nof iron.  He disposed as absolutely of the lives and fortunes of his\nconquered subjects as an eastern monarch; and forbade, upon pain of\ndeath, the English either fire or candle in their houses after eight\no'clock; whether was this to prevent their nocturnal meetings, or only to\ntry, by an odd and whimsical prohibition, how far it was possible for one\nman to extend his power over his fellow-creatures.  It is true, indeed,\nthat the English had Parliaments before and after William the Conqueror,\nand they boast of them, as though these assemblies then called\nParliaments, composed of ecclesiastical tyrants and of plunderers\nentitled barons, had been the guardians of the public liberty and\nhappiness.\nThe barbarians who came from the shores of the Baltic, and settled in the\nrest of Europe, brought with them the form of government called States or\nParliaments, about which so much noise is made, and which are so little\nunderstood.  Kings, indeed, were not absolute in those days; but then the\npeople were more wretched upon that very account, and more completely\nenslaved.  The chiefs of these savages, who had laid waste France, Italy,\nSpain, and England, made themselves monarchs.  Their generals divided\namong themselves the several countries they had conquered, whence sprung\nthose margraves, those peers, those barons, those petty tyrants, who\noften contested with their sovereigns for the spoils of whole nations.\nThese were birds of prey fighting with an eagle for doves whose blood the\nvictorious was to suck.  Every nation, instead of being governed by one\nmaster, was trampled upon by a hundred tyrants.  The priests soon played\na part among them.  Before this it had been the fate of the Gauls, the\nGermans, and the Britons, to be always governed by their Druids and the\nchiefs of their villages, an ancient kind of barons, not so tyrannical as\ntheir successors.  These Druids pretended to be mediators between God and\nman.  They enacted laws, they fulminated their excommunications, and\nsentenced to death.  The bishops succeeded, by insensible degrees, to\ntheir temporal authority in the Goth and Vandal government.  The popes\nset themselves at their head, and armed with their briefs, their bulls,\nand reinforced by monks, they made even kings tremble, deposed and\nassassinated them at pleasure, and employed every artifice to draw into\ntheir own purses moneys from all parts of Europe.  The weak Ina, one of\nthe tyrants of the Saxon Heptarchy in England, was the first monarch who\nsubmitted, in his pilgrimage to Rome, to pay St. Peter's penny\n(equivalent very near to a French crown) for every house in his\ndominions.  The whole island soon followed his example; England became\ninsensibly one of the Pope's provinces, and the Holy Father used to send\nfrom time to time his legates thither to levy exorbitant taxes.  At last\nKing John delivered up by a public instrument the kingdom of England to\nthe Pope, who had excommunicated him; but the barons, not finding their\naccount in this resignation, dethroned the wretched King John and seated\nLouis, father to St. Louis, King of France, in his place.  However, they\nwere soon weary of their new monarch, and accordingly obliged him to\nreturn to France.\nWhilst that the barons, the bishops, and the popes, all laid waste\nEngland, where all were for ruling the most numerous, the most useful,\neven the most virtuous, and consequently the most venerable part of\nmankind, consisting of those who study the laws and the sciences, of\ntraders, of artificers, in a word, of all who were not tyrants--that is,\nthose who are called the people: these, I say, were by them looked upon\nas so many animals beneath the dignity of the human species.  The Commons\nin those ages were far from sharing in the government, they being\nvillains or peasants, whose labour, whose blood, were the property of\ntheir masters who entitled themselves the nobility.  The major part of\nmen in Europe were at that time what they are to this day in several\nparts of the world--they were villains or bondsmen of lords--that is, a\nkind of cattle bought and sold with the land.  Many ages passed away\nbefore justice could be done to human nature--before mankind were\nconscious that it was abominable for many to sow, and but few reap.  And\nwas not France very happy, when the power and authority of those petty\nrobbers was abolished by the lawful authority of kings and of the people?\nHappily, in the violent shocks which the divisions between kings and the\nnobles gave to empires, the chains of nations were more or less heavy.\nLiberty in England sprang from the quarrels of tyrants.  The barons\nforced King John and King Henry III. to grant the famous Magna Charta,\nthe chief design of which was indeed to make kings dependent on the\nLords; but then the rest of the nation were a little favoured in it, in\norder that they might join on proper occasions with their pretended\nmasters.  This great Charter, which is considered as the sacred origin of\nthe English liberties, shows in itself how little liberty was known.\nThe title alone proves that the king thought he had a just right to be\nabsolute; and that the barons, and even the clergy, forced him to give up\nthe pretended right, for no other reason but because they were the most\npowerful.\nMagna Charta begins in this style: \"We grant, of our own free will, the\nfollowing privileges to the archbishops, bishops, priors, and barons of\nour kingdom,\" etc.\nThe House of Commons is not once mentioned in the articles of this\nCharter--a proof that it did not yet exist, or that it existed without\npower.  Mention is therein made, by name, of the freemen of England--a\nmelancholy proof that some were not so.  It appears, by Article XXXII.,\nthat these pretended freemen owed service to their lords.  Such a liberty\nas this was not many removes from slavery.\nBy Article XXI., the king ordains that his officers shall not\nhenceforward seize upon, unless they pay for them, the horses and carts\nof freemen.  The people considered this ordinance as a real liberty,\nthough it was a greater tyranny.  Henry VII., that happy usurper and\ngreat politician, who pretended to love the barons, though he in reality\nhated and feared them, got their lands alienated.  By this means the\nvillains, afterwards acquiring riches by their industry, purchased the\nestates and country seats of the illustrious peers who had ruined\nthemselves by their folly and extravagance, and all the lands got by\ninsensible degrees into other hands.\nThe power of the House of Commons increased every day.  The families of\nthe ancient peers were at last extinct; and as peers only are properly\nnoble in England, there would be no such thing in strictness of law as\nnobility in that island, had not the kings created new barons from time\nto time, and preserved the body of peers, once a terror to them, to\noppose them to the Commons, since become so formidable.\nAll these new peers who compose the Higher House receive nothing but\ntheir titles from the king, and very few of them have estates in those\nplaces whence they take their titles.  One shall be Duke of D-, though he\nhas not a foot of land in Dorsetshire; and another is Earl of a village,\nthough he scarce knows where it is situated.  The peers have power, but\nit is only in the Parliament House.\nThere is no such thing here as _haute_, _moyenne_, and _basse\njustice_--that is, a power to judge in all matters civil and criminal;\nnor a right or privilege of hunting in the grounds of a citizen, who at\nthe same time is not permitted to fire a gun in his own field.\nNo one is exempted in this country from paying certain taxes because he\nis a nobleman or a priest.  All duties and taxes are settled by the House\nof Commons, whose power is greater than that of the Peers, though\ninferior to it in dignity.  The spiritual as well as temporal Lords have\nthe liberty to reject a Money Bill brought in by the Commons; but they\nare not allowed to alter anything in it, and must either pass or throw it\nout without restriction.  When the Bill has passed the Lords and is\nsigned by the king, then the whole nation pays, every man in proportion\nto his revenue or estate, not according to his title, which would be\nabsurd.  There is no such thing as an arbitrary subsidy or poll-tax, but\na real tax on the lands, of all which an estimate was made in the reign\nof the famous King William III.\nThe land-tax continues still upon the same foot, though the revenue of\nthe lands is increased.  Thus no one is tyrannised over, and every one is\neasy.  The feet of the peasants are not bruised by wooden shoes; they eat\nwhite bread, are well clothed, and are not afraid of increasing their\nstock of cattle, nor of tiling their houses, from any apprehension that\ntheir taxes will be raised the year following.  The annual income of the\nestates of a great many commoners in England amounts to two hundred\nthousand livres, and yet these do not think it beneath them to plough the\nlands which enrich them, and on which they enjoy their liberty.\nLETTER X.--ON TRADE\nAs trade enriched the citizens in England, so it contributed to their\nfreedom, and this freedom on the other side extended their commerce,\nwhence arose the grandeur of the State.  Trade raised by insensible\ndegrees the naval power, which gives the English a superiority over the\nseas, and they now are masters of very near two hundred ships of war.\nPosterity will very probably be surprised to hear that an island whose\nonly produce is a little lead, tin, fuller's-earth, and coarse wool,\nshould become so powerful by its commerce, as to be able to send, in\n1723, three fleets at the same time to three different and far distanced\nparts of the globe.  One before Gibraltar, conquered and still possessed\nby the English; a second to Portobello, to dispossess the King of Spain\nof the treasures of the West Indies; and a third into the Baltic, to\nprevent the Northern Powers from coming to an engagement.\nAt the time when Louis XIV. made all Italy tremble, and that his armies,\nwhich had already possessed themselves of Savoy and Piedmont, were upon\nthe point of taking Turin; Prince Eugene was obliged to march from the\nmiddle of Germany in order to succour Savoy.  Having no money, without\nwhich cities cannot be either taken or defended, he addressed himself to\nsome English merchants.  These, at an hour and half's warning, lent him\nfive millions, whereby he was enabled to deliver Turin, and to beat the\nFrench; after which he wrote the following short letter to the persons\nwho had disbursed him the above-mentioned sums: \"Gentlemen, I have\nreceived your money, and flatter myself that I have laid it out to your\nsatisfaction.\"  Such a circumstance as this raises a just pride in an\nEnglish merchant, and makes him presume (not without some reason) to\ncompare himself to a Roman citizen; and, indeed, a peer's brother does\nnot think traffic beneath him.  When the Lord Townshend was Minister of\nState, a brother of his was content to be a City merchant; and at the\ntime that the Earl of Oxford governed Great Britain, a younger brother\nwas no more than a factor in Aleppo, where he chose to live, and where he\ndied.  This custom, which begins, however, to be laid aside, appears\nmonstrous to Germans, vainly puffed up with their extraction.  These\nthink it morally impossible that the son of an English peer should be no\nmore than a rich and powerful citizen, for all are princes in Germany.\nThere have been thirty highnesses of the same name, all whose patrimony\nconsisted only in their escutcheons and their pride.\nIn France the title of marquis is given gratis to any one who will accept\nof it; and whosoever arrives at Paris from the midst of the most remote\nprovinces with money in his purse, and a name terminating in _ac_ or\n_ille_, may strut about, and cry, \"Such a man as I!  A man of my rank and\nfigure!\" and may look down upon a trader with sovereign contempt; whilst\nthe trader on the other side, by thus often hearing his profession\ntreated so disdainfully, is fool enough to blush at it.  However, I need\nnot say which is most useful to a nation; a lord, powdered in the tip of\nthe mode, who knows exactly at what o'clock the king rises and goes to\nbed, and who gives himself airs of grandeur and state, at the same time\nthat he is acting the slave in the ante-chamber of a prime minister; or a\nmerchant, who enriches his country, despatches orders from his counting-\nhouse to Surat and Grand Cairo, and contributes to the well-being of the\nworld.\nLETTER XI.--ON INOCULATION\nIt is inadvertently affirmed in the Christian countries of Europe that\nthe English are fools and madmen.  Fools, because they give their\nchildren the small-pox to prevent their catching it; and madmen, because\nthey wantonly communicate a certain and dreadful distemper to their\nchildren, merely to prevent an uncertain evil.  The English, on the other\nside, call the rest of the Europeans cowardly and unnatural.  Cowardly,\nbecause they are afraid of putting their children to a little pain;\nunnatural, because they expose them to die one time or other of the small-\npox.  But that the reader may be able to judge whether the English or\nthose who differ from them in opinion are in the right, here follows the\nhistory of the famed inoculation, which is mentioned with so much dread\nin France.\nThe Circassian women have, from time immemorial, communicated the small-\npox to their children when not above six months old by making an incision\nin the arm, and by putting into this incision a pustule, taken carefully\nfrom the body of another child.  This pustule produces the same effect in\nthe arm it is laid in as yeast in a piece of dough; it ferments, and\ndiffuses through the whole mass of blood the qualities with which it is\nimpregnated.  The pustules of the child in whom the artificial small-pox\nhas been thus inoculated are employed to communicate the same distemper\nto others.  There is an almost perpetual circulation of it in Circassia;\nand when unhappily the small-pox has quite left the country, the\ninhabitants of it are in as great trouble and perplexity as other nations\nwhen their harvest has fallen short.\nThe circumstance that introduced a custom in Circassia, which appears so\nsingular to others, is nevertheless a cause common to all nations, I mean\nmaternal tenderness and interest.\nThe Circassians are poor, and their daughters are beautiful, and indeed,\nit is in them they chiefly trade.  They furnish with beauties the\nseraglios of the Turkish Sultan, of the Persian Sophy, and of all those\nwho are wealthy enough to purchase and maintain such precious\nmerchandise.  These maidens are very honourably and virtuously instructed\nto fondle and caress men; are taught dances of a very polite and\neffeminate kind; and how to heighten by the most voluptuous artifices the\npleasures of their disdainful masters for whom they are designed.  These\nunhappy creatures repeat their lesson to their mothers, in the same\nmanner as little girls among us repeat their catechism without\nunderstanding one word they say.\nNow it often happened that, after a father and mother had taken the\nutmost care of the education of their children, they were frustrated of\nall their hopes in an instant.  The small-pox getting into the family,\none daughter died of it, another lost an eye, a third had a great nose at\nher recovery, and the unhappy parents were completely ruined.  Even,\nfrequently, when the small-pox became epidemical, trade was suspended for\nseveral years, which thinned very considerably the seraglios of Persia\nand Turkey.\nA trading nation is always watchful over its own interests, and grasps at\nevery discovery that may be of advantage to its commerce.  The\nCircassians observed that scarce one person in a thousand was ever\nattacked by a small-pox of a violent kind.  That some, indeed, had this\ndistemper very favourably three or four times, but never twice so as to\nprove fatal; in a word, that no one ever had it in a violent degree twice\nin his life.  They observed farther, that when the small-pox is of the\nmilder sort, and the pustules have only a tender, delicate skin to break\nthrough, they never leave the least scar in the face.  From these natural\nobservations they concluded, that in case an infant of six months or a\nyear old should have a milder sort of small-pox, he would not die of it,\nwould not be marked, nor be ever afflicted with it again.\nIn order, therefore, to preserve the life and beauty of their children,\nthe only thing remaining was to give them the small-pox in their infant\nyears.  This they did by inoculating in the body of a child a pustule\ntaken from the most regular and at the same time the most favourable sort\nof small-pox that could be procured.\nThe experiment could not possibly fail.  The Turks, who are people of\ngood sense, soon adopted this custom, insomuch that at this time there is\nnot a bassa in Constantinople but communicates the small-pox to his\nchildren of both sexes immediately upon their being weaned.\nSome pretend that the Circassians borrowed this custom anciently from the\nArabians; but we shall leave the clearing up of this point of history to\nsome learned Benedictine, who will not fail to compile a great many\nfolios on this subject, with the several proofs or authorities.  All I\nhave to say upon it is that, in the beginning of the reign of King George\nI., the Lady Wortley Montague, a woman of as fine a genius, and endued\nwith as great a strength of mind, as any of her sex in the British\nKingdoms, being with her husband, who was ambassador at the Porte, made\nno scruple to communicate the small-pox to an infant of which she was\ndelivered in Constantinople.  The chaplain represented to his lady, but\nto no purpose, that this was an unchristian operation, and therefore that\nit could succeed with none but infidels.  However, it had the most happy\neffect upon the son of the Lady Wortley Montague, who, at her return to\nEngland, communicated the experiment to the Princess of Wales, now Queen\nof England.  It must be confessed that this princess, abstracted from her\ncrown and titles, was born to encourage the whole circle of arts, and to\ndo good to mankind.  She appears as an amiable philosopher on the throne,\nhaving never let slip one opportunity of improving the great talents she\nreceived from Nature, nor of exerting her beneficence.  It is she who,\nbeing informed that a daughter of Milton was living, but in miserable\ncircumstances, immediately sent her a considerable present.  It is she\nwho protects the learned Father Courayer.  It is she who condescended to\nattempt a reconciliation between Dr. Clark and Mr. Leibnitz.  The moment\nthis princess heard of inoculation, she caused an experiment of it to be\nmade on four criminals sentenced to die, and by that means preserved\ntheir lives doubly; for she not only saved them from the gallows, but by\nmeans of this artificial small-pox prevented their ever having that\ndistemper in a natural way, with which they would very probably have been\nattacked one time or other, and might have died of in a more advanced\nage.\nThe princess being assured of the usefulness of this operation, caused\nher own children to be inoculated.  A great part of the kingdom followed\nher example, and since that time ten thousand children, at least, of\npersons of condition owe in this manner their lives to her Majesty and to\nthe Lady Wortley Montague; and as many of the fair sex are obliged to\nthem for their beauty.\nUpon a general calculation, threescore persons in every hundred have the\nsmall-pox.  Of these threescore, twenty die of it in the most favourable\nseason of life, and as many more wear the disagreeable remains of it in\ntheir faces so long as they live.  Thus, a fifth part of mankind either\ndie or are disfigured by this distemper.  But it does not prove fatal to\nso much as one among those who are inoculated in Turkey or in England,\nunless the patient be infirm, or would have died had not the experiment\nbeen made upon him.  Besides, no one is disfigured, no one has the small-\npox a second time, if the inoculation was perfect.  It is therefore\ncertain, that had the lady of some French ambassador brought this secret\nfrom Constantinople to Paris, the nation would have been for ever obliged\nto her.  Then the Duke de Villequier, father to the Duke d'Aumont, who\nenjoys the most vigorous constitution, and is the healthiest man in\nFrance, would not have been cut off in the flower of his age.\nThe Prince of Soubise, happy in the finest flush of health, would not\nhave been snatched away at five-and-twenty, nor the Dauphin, grandfather\nto Louis XV., have been laid in his grave in his fiftieth year.  Twenty\nthousand persons whom the small-pox swept away at Paris in 1723 would\nhave been alive at this time.  But are not the French fond of life, and\nis beauty so inconsiderable an advantage as to be disregarded by the\nladies?  It must be confessed that we are an odd kind of people.  Perhaps\nour nation will imitate ten years hence this practice of the English, if\nthe clergy and the physicians will but give them leave to do it; or\npossibly our countrymen may introduce inoculation three months hence in\nFrance out of mere whim, in case the English should discontinue it\nthrough fickleness.\nI am informed that the Chinese have practised inoculation these hundred\nyears, a circumstance that argues very much in its favour, since they are\nthought to be the wisest and best governed people in the world.  The\nChinese, indeed, do not communicate this distemper by inoculation, but at\nthe nose, in the same manner as we take snuff.  This is a more agreeable\nway, but then it produces the like effects; and proves at the same time\nthat had inoculation been practised in France it would have saved the\nlives of thousands.\nLETTER XII.--ON THE LORD BACON\nNot long since the trite and frivolous question following was debated in\na very polite and learned company, viz., Who was the greatest man, Caesar,\nAlexander, Tamerlane, Cromwell, &c.?\nSomebody answered that Sir Isaac Newton excelled them all.  The\ngentleman's assertion was very just; for if true greatness consists in\nhaving received from heaven a mighty genius, and in having employed it to\nenlighten our own mind and that of others, a man like Sir Isaac Newton,\nwhose equal is hardly found in a thousand years, is the truly great man.\nAnd those politicians and conquerors (and all ages produce some) were\ngenerally so many illustrious wicked men.  That man claims our respect\nwho commands over the minds of the rest of the world by the force of\ntruth, not those who enslave their fellow-creatures: he who is acquainted\nwith the universe, not they who deface it.\nSince, therefore, you desire me to give you an account of the famous\npersonages whom England has given birth to, I shall begin with Lord\nBacon, Mr. Locke, Sir Isaac Newton, &c.  Afterwards the warriors and\nMinisters of State shall come in their order.\nI must begin with the celebrated Viscount Verulam, known in Europe by the\nname of Bacon, which was that of his family.  His father had been Lord\nKeeper, and himself was a great many years Lord Chancellor under King\nJames I.  Nevertheless, amidst the intrigues of a Court, and the affairs\nof his exalted employment, which alone were enough to engross his whole\ntime, he yet found so much leisure for study as to make himself a great\nphilosopher, a good historian, and an elegant writer; and a still more\nsurprising circumstance is that he lived in an age in which the art of\nwriting justly and elegantly was little known, much less true philosophy.\nLord Bacon, as is the fate of man, was more esteemed after his death than\nin his lifetime.  His enemies were in the British Court, and his admirers\nwere foreigners.\nWhen the Marquis d'Effiat attended in England upon the Princess Henrietta\nMaria, daughter to Henry IV., whom King Charles I. had married, that\nMinister went and visited the Lord Bacon, who, being at that time sick in\nhis bed, received him with the curtains shut close.  \"You resemble the\nangels,\" says the Marquis to him; \"we hear those beings spoken of\nperpetually, and we believe them superior to men, but are never allowed\nthe consolation to see them.\"\nYou know that this great man was accused of a crime very unbecoming a\nphilosopher: I mean bribery and extortion.  You know that he was\nsentenced by the House of Lords to pay a fine of about four hundred\nthousand French livres, to lose his peerage and his dignity of\nChancellor; but in the present age the English revere his memory to such\na degree, that they will scarce allow him to have been guilty.  In case\nyou should ask what are my thoughts on this head, I shall answer you in\nthe words which I heard the Lord Bolingbroke use on another occasion.\nSeveral gentlemen were speaking, in his company, of the avarice with\nwhich the late Duke of Marlborough had been charged, some examples\nwhereof being given, the Lord Bolingbroke was appealed to (who, having\nbeen in the opposite party, might perhaps, without the imputation of\nindecency, have been allowed to clear up that matter): \"He was so great a\nman,\" replied his lordship, \"that I have forgot his vices.\"\nI shall therefore confine myself to those things which so justly gained\nLord Bacon the esteem of all Europe.\nThe most singular and the best of all his pieces is that which, at this\ntime, is the most useless and the least read, I mean his _Novum\nScientiarum Organum_.  This is the scaffold with which the new philosophy\nwas raised; and when the edifice was built, part of it at least, the\nscaffold was no longer of service.\nThe Lord Bacon was not yet acquainted with Nature, but then he knew, and\npointed out, the several paths that lead to it.  He had despised in his\nyounger years the thing called philosophy in the Universities, and did\nall that lay in his power to prevent those societies of men instituted to\nimprove human reason from depraving it by their quiddities, their horrors\nof the vacuum, their substantial forms, and all those impertinent terms\nwhich not only ignorance had rendered venerable, but which had been made\nsacred by their being ridiculously blended with religion.\nHe is the father of experimental philosophy.  It must, indeed, be\nconfessed that very surprising secrets had been found out before his\ntime--the sea-compass, printing, engraving on copper plates,\noil-painting, looking-glasses; the art of restoring, in some measure, old\nmen to their sight by spectacles; gunpowder, &c., had been discovered.  A\nnew world had been fought for, found, and conquered.  Would not one\nsuppose that these sublime discoveries had been made by the greatest\nphilosophers, and in ages much more enlightened than the present?  But it\nwas far otherwise; all these great changes happened in the most stupid\nand barbarous times.  Chance only gave birth to most of those inventions;\nand it is very probable that what is called chance contributed very much\nto the discovery of America; at least, it has been always thought that\nChristopher Columbus undertook his voyage merely on the relation of a\ncaptain of a ship which a storm had driven as far westward as the\nCaribbean Islands.  Be this as it will, men had sailed round the world,\nand could destroy cities by an artificial thunder more dreadful than the\nreal one; but, then, they were not acquainted with the circulation of the\nblood, the weight of the air, the laws of motion, light, the number of\nour planets, &c.  And a man who maintained a thesis on Aristotle's\n\"Categories,\" on the universals _a parte rei_, or such-like nonsense, was\nlooked upon as a prodigy.\nThe most astonishing, the most useful inventions, are not those which\nreflect the greatest honour on the human mind.  It is to a mechanical\ninstinct, which is found in many men, and not to true philosophy, that\nmost arts owe their origin.\nThe discovery of fire, the art of making bread, of melting and preparing\nmetals, of building houses, and the invention of the shuttle, are\ninfinitely more beneficial to mankind than printing or the sea-compass:\nand yet these arts were invented by uncultivated, savage men.\nWhat a prodigious use the Greeks and Romans made afterwards of mechanics!\nNevertheless, they believed that there were crystal heavens, that the\nstars were small lamps which sometimes fell into the sea, and one of\ntheir greatest philosophers, after long researches, found that the stars\nwere so many flints which had been detached from the earth.\nIn a word, no one before the Lord Bacon was acquainted with experimental\nphilosophy, nor with the several physical experiments which have been\nmade since his time.  Scarce one of them but is hinted at in his work,\nand he himself had made several.  He made a kind of pneumatic engine, by\nwhich he guessed the elasticity of the air.  He approached, on all sides\nas it were, to the discovery of its weight, and had very near attained\nit, but some time after Torricelli seized upon this truth.  In a little\ntime experimental philosophy began to be cultivated on a sudden in most\nparts of Europe.  It was a hidden treasure which the Lord Bacon had some\nnotion of, and which all the philosophers, encouraged by his promises,\nendeavoured to dig up.\nBut that which surprised me most was to read in his work, in express\nterms, the new attraction, the invention of which is ascribed to Sir\nIsaac Newton.\nWe must search, says Lord Bacon, whether there may not be a kind of\nmagnetic power which operates between the earth and heavy bodies, between\nthe moon and the ocean, between the planets, &c.  In another place he\nsays either heavy bodies must be carried towards the centre of the earth,\nor must be reciprocally attracted by it; and in the latter case it is\nevident that the nearer bodies, in their falling, draw towards the earth,\nthe stronger they will attract one another.  We must, says he, make an\nexperiment to see whether the same clock will go faster on the top of a\nmountain or at the bottom of a mine; whether the strength of the weights\ndecreases on the mountain and increases in the mine.  It is probable that\nthe earth has a true attractive power.\nThis forerunner in philosophy was also an elegant writer, an historian,\nand a wit.\nHis moral essays are greatly esteemed, but they were drawn up in the view\nof instructing rather than of pleasing; and, as they are not a satire\nupon mankind, like Rochefoucauld's \"Maxims,\" nor written upon a sceptical\nplan, like Montaigne's \"Essays,\" they are not so much read as those two\ningenious authors.\nHis History of Henry VII. was looked upon as a masterpiece, but how is it\npossible that some persons can presume to compare so little a work with\nthe history of our illustrious Thuanus?\nSpeaking about the famous impostor Perkin, son to a converted Jew, who\nassumed boldly the name and title of Richard IV., King of England, at the\ninstigation of the Duchess of Burgundy, and who disputed the crown with\nHenry VII., the Lord Bacon writes as follows:--\n\"At this time the King began again to be haunted with sprites, by the\nmagic and curious arts of the Lady Margaret, who raised up the ghost of\nRichard, Duke of York, second son to King Edward IV., to walk and vex the\nKing.\n\"After such time as she (Margaret of Burgundy) thought he (Perkin\nWarbeck) was perfect in his lesson, she began to cast with herself from\nwhat coast this blazing star should first appear, and at what time it\nmust be upon the horizon of Ireland; for there had the like meteor strong\ninfluence before.\"\nMethinks our sagacious Thuanus does not give in to such fustian, which\nformerly was looked upon as sublime, but in this age is justly called\nnonsense.\nLETTER XIII.--ON MR. LOCKE\nPerhaps no man ever had a more judicious or more methodical genius, or\nwas a more acute logician than Mr. Locke, and yet he was not deeply\nskilled in the mathematics.  This great man could never subject himself\nto the tedious fatigue of calculations, nor to the dry pursuit of\nmathematical truths, which do not at first present any sensible objects\nto the mind; and no one has given better proofs than he, that it is\npossible for a man to have a geometrical head without the assistance of\ngeometry.  Before his time, several great philosophers had declared, in\nthe most positive terms, what the soul of man is; but as these absolutely\nknew nothing about it, they might very well be allowed to differ entirely\nin opinion from one another.\nIn Greece, the infant seat of arts and of errors, and where the grandeur\nas well as folly of the human mind went such prodigious lengths, the\npeople used to reason about the soul in the very same manner as we do.\nThe divine Anaxagoras, in whose honour an altar was erected for his\nhaving taught mankind that the sun was greater than Peloponnesus, that\nsnow was black, and that the heavens were of stone, affirmed that the\nsoul was an aerial spirit, but at the same time immortal.  Diogenes (not\nhe who was a cynical philosopher after having coined base money) declared\nthat the soul was a portion of the substance of God: an idea which we\nmust confess was very sublime.  Epicurus maintained that it was composed\nof parts in the same manner as the body.\nAristotle, who has been explained a thousand ways, because he is\nunintelligible, was of opinion, according to some of his disciples, that\nthe understanding in all men is one and the same substance.\nThe divine Plato, master of the divine Aristotle,--and the divine\nSocrates, master of the divine Plato--used to say that the soul was\ncorporeal and eternal.  No doubt but the demon of Socrates had instructed\nhim in the nature of it.  Some people, indeed, pretend that a man who\nboasted his being attended by a familiar genius must infallibly be either\na knave or a madman, but this kind of people are seldom satisfied with\nanything but reason.\nWith regard to the Fathers of the Church, several in the primitive ages\nbelieved that the soul was human, and the angels and God corporeal.  Men\nnaturally improve upon every system.  St. Bernard, as Father Mabillon\nconfesses, taught that the soul after death does not see God in the\ncelestial regions, but converses with Christ's human nature only.\nHowever, he was not believed this time on his bare word; the adventure of\nthe crusade having a little sunk the credit of his oracles.  Afterwards a\nthousand schoolmen arose, such as the Irrefragable Doctor, the Subtile\nDoctor, the Angelic Doctor, the Seraphic Doctor, and the Cherubic Doctor,\nwho were all sure that they had a very clear and distinct idea of the\nsoul, and yet wrote in such a manner, that one would conclude they were\nresolved no one should understand a word in their writings.  Our\nDescartes, born to discover the errors of antiquity, and at the same time\nto substitute his own, and hurried away by that systematic spirit which\nthrows a cloud over the minds of the greatest men, thought he had\ndemonstrated that the soul is the same thing as thought, in the same\nmanner as matter, in his opinion, is the same as extension.  He asserted,\nthat man thinks eternally, and that the soul, at its coming into the\nbody, is informed with the whole series of metaphysical notions: knowing\nGod, infinite space, possessing all abstract ideas--in a word, completely\nendued with the most sublime lights, which it unhappily forgets at its\nissuing from the womb.\nFather Malebranche, in his sublime illusions, not only admitted innate\nideas, but did not doubt of our living wholly in God, and that God is, as\nit were, our soul.\nSuch a multitude of reasoners having written the romance of the soul, a\nsage at last arose, who gave, with an air of the greatest modesty, the\nhistory of it.  Mr. Locke has displayed the human soul in the same manner\nas an excellent anatomist explains the springs of the human body.  He\neverywhere takes the light of physics for his guide.  He sometimes\npresumes to speak affirmatively, but then he presumes also to doubt.\nInstead of concluding at once what we know not, he examines gradually\nwhat we would know.  He takes an infant at the instant of his birth; he\ntraces, step by step, the progress of his understanding; examines what\nthings he has in common with beasts, and what he possesses above them.\nAbove all, he consults himself: the being conscious that he himself\nthinks.\n\"I shall leave,\" says he, \"to those who know more of this matter than\nmyself, the examining whether the soul exists before or after the\norganisation of our bodies.  But I confess that it is my lot to be\nanimated with one of those heavy souls which do not think always; and I\nam even so unhappy as not to conceive that it is more necessary the soul\nshould think perpetually than that bodies should be for ever in motion.\"\nWith regard to myself, I shall boast that I have the honour to be as\nstupid in this particular as Mr. Locke.  No one shall ever make me\nbelieve that I think always: and I am as little inclined as he could be\nto fancy that some weeks after I was conceived I was a very learned soul;\nknowing at that time a thousand things which I forgot at my birth; and\npossessing when in the womb (though to no manner of purpose) knowledge\nwhich I lost the instant I had occasion for it; and which I have never\nsince been able to recover perfectly.\nMr. Locke, after having destroyed innate ideas; after having fully\nrenounced the vanity of believing that we think always; after having laid\ndown, from the most solid principles, that ideas enter the mind through\nthe senses; having examined our simple and complex ideas; having traced\nthe human mind through its several operations; having shown that all the\nlanguages in the world are imperfect, and the great abuse that is made of\nwords every moment, he at last comes to consider the extent or rather the\nnarrow limits of human knowledge.  It was in this chapter he presumed to\nadvance, but very modestly, the following words: \"We shall, perhaps,\nnever be capable of knowing whether a being, purely material, thinks or\nnot.\"  This sage assertion was, by more divines than one, looked upon as\na scandalous declaration that the soul is material and mortal.  Some\nEnglishmen, devout after their way, sounded an alarm.  The superstitious\nare the same in society as cowards in an army; they themselves are seized\nwith a panic fear, and communicate it to others.  It was loudly exclaimed\nthat Mr. Locke intended to destroy religion; nevertheless, religion had\nnothing to do in the affair, it being a question purely philosophical,\naltogether independent of faith and revelation.  Mr. Locke's opponents\nneeded but to examine, calmly and impartially, whether the declaring that\nmatter can think, implies a contradiction; and whether God is able to\ncommunicate thought to matter.  But divines are too apt to begin their\ndeclarations with saying that God is offended when people differ from\nthem in opinion; in which they too much resemble the bad poets, who used\nto declare publicly that Boileau spake irreverently of Louis XIV.,\nbecause he ridiculed their stupid productions.  Bishop Stillingfleet got\nthe reputation of a calm and unprejudiced divine because he did not\nexpressly make use of injurious terms in his dispute with Mr. Locke.  That\ndivine entered the lists against him, but was defeated; for he argued as\na schoolman, and Locke as a philosopher, who was perfectly acquainted\nwith the strong as well as the weak side of the human mind, and who\nfought with weapons whose temper he knew.  If I might presume to give my\nopinion on so delicate a subject after Mr. Locke, I would say, that men\nhave long disputed on the nature and the immortality of the soul.  With\nregard to its immortality, it is impossible to give a demonstration of\nit, since its nature is still the subject of controversy; which, however,\nmust be thoroughly understood before a person can be able to determine\nwhether it be immortal or not.  Human reason is so little able, merely by\nits own strength, to demonstrate the immortality of the soul, that it was\nabsolutely necessary religion should reveal it to us.  It is of advantage\nto society in general, that mankind should believe the soul to be\nimmortal; faith commands us to do this; nothing more is required, and the\nmatter is cleared up at once.  But it is otherwise with respect to its\nnature; it is of little importance to religion, which only requires the\nsoul to be virtuous, whatever substance it may be made of.  It is a clock\nwhich is given us to regulate, but the artist has not told us of what\nmaterials the spring of this chock is composed.\nI am a body, and, I think, that's all I know of the matter.  Shall I\nascribe to an unknown cause, what I can so easily impute to the only\nsecond cause I am acquainted with?  Here all the school philosophers\ninterrupt me with their arguments, and declare that there is only\nextension and solidity in bodies, and that there they can have nothing\nbut motion and figure.  Now motion, figure, extension and solidity cannot\nform a thought, and consequently the soul cannot be matter.  All this so\noften repeated mighty series of reasoning, amounts to no more than this:\nI am absolutely ignorant what matter is; I guess, but imperfectly, some\nproperties of it; now I absolutely cannot tell whether these properties\nmay be joined to thought.  As I therefore know nothing, I maintain\npositively that matter cannot think.  In this manner do the schools\nreason.\nMr. Locke addressed these gentlemen in the candid, sincere manner\nfollowing: At least confess yourselves to be as ignorant as I.  Neither\nyour imaginations nor mine are able to comprehend in what manner a body\nis susceptible of ideas; and do you conceive better in what manner a\nsubstance, of what kind soever, is susceptible of them?  As you cannot\ncomprehend either matter or spirit, why will you presume to assert\nanything?\nThe superstitious man comes afterwards and declares, that all those must\nbe burnt for the good of their souls, who so much as suspect that it is\npossible for the body to think without any foreign assistance.  But what\nwould these people say should they themselves be proved irreligious?  And\nindeed, what man can presume to assert, without being guilty at the same\ntime of the greatest impiety, that it is impossible for the Creator to\nform matter with thought and sensation?  Consider only, I beg you, what a\ndilemma you bring yourselves into, you who confine in this manner the\npower of the Creator.  Beasts have the same organs, the same sensations,\nthe same perceptions as we; they have memory, and combine certain ideas.\nIn case it was not in the power of God to animate matter, and inform it\nwith sensation, the consequence would be, either that beasts are mere\nmachines, or that they have a spiritual soul.\nMethinks it is clearly evident that beasts cannot be mere machines, which\nI prove thus.  God has given to them the very same organs of sensation as\nto us: if therefore they have no sensation, God has created a useless\nthing; now according to your own confession God does nothing in vain; He\ntherefore did not create so many organs of sensation, merely for them to\nbe uninformed with this faculty; consequently beasts are not mere\nmachines.  Beasts, according to your assertion, cannot be animated with a\nspiritual soul; you will, therefore, in spite of yourself, be reduced to\nthis only assertion, viz., that God has endued the organs of beasts, who\nare mere matter, with the faculties of sensation and perception, which\nyou call instinct in them.  But why may not God, if He pleases,\ncommunicate to our more delicate organs, that faculty of feeling,\nperceiving, and thinking, which we call human reason?  To whatever side\nyou turn, you are forced to acknowledge your own ignorance, and the\nboundless power of the Creator.  Exclaim therefore no more against the\nsage, the modest philosophy of Mr. Locke, which so far from interfering\nwith religion, would be of use to demonstrate the truth of it, in case\nreligion wanted any such support.  For what philosophy can be of a more\nreligious nature than that, which affirming nothing but what it conceives\nclearly, and conscious of its own weakness, declares that we must always\nhave recourse to God in our examining of the first principles?\nBesides, we must not be apprehensive that any philosophical opinion will\never prejudice the religion of a country.  Though our demonstrations\nclash directly with our mysteries, that is nothing to the purpose, for\nthe latter are not less revered upon that account by our Christian\nphilosophers, who know very well that the objects of reason and those of\nfaith are of a very different nature.  Philosophers will never form a\nreligious sect, the reason of which is, their writings are not calculated\nfor the vulgar, and they themselves are free from enthusiasm.  If we\ndivide mankind into twenty parts, it will be found that nineteen of these\nconsist of persons employed in manual labour, who will never know that\nsuch a man as Mr. Locke existed.  In the remaining twentieth part how few\nare readers?  And among such as are so, twenty amuse themselves with\nromances to one who studies philosophy.  The thinking part of mankind is\nconfined to a very small number, and these will never disturb the peace\nand tranquillity of the world.\nNeither Montaigne, Locke, Bayle, Spinoza, Hobbes, the Lord Shaftesbury,\nCollins, nor Toland lighted up the firebrand of discord in their\ncountries; this has generally been the work of divines, who being at\nfirst puffed up with the ambition of becoming chiefs of a sect, soon grew\nvery desirous of being at the head of a party.  But what do I say?  All\nthe works of the modern philosophers put together will never make so much\nnoise as even the dispute which arose among the Franciscans, merely about\nthe fashion of their sleeves and of their cowls.\nLETTER XIV.--ON DESCARTES AND SIR ISAAC NEWTON\nA Frenchman who arrives in London, will find philosophy, like everything\nelse, very much changed there.  He had left the world a plenum, and he\nnow finds it a vacuum.  At Paris the universe is seen composed of\nvortices of subtile matter; but nothing like it is seen in London.  In\nFrance, it is the pressure of the moon that causes the tides; but in\nEngland it is the sea that gravitates towards the moon; so that when you\nthink that the moon should make it flood with us, those gentlemen fancy\nit should be ebb, which very unluckily cannot be proved.  For to be able\nto do this, it is necessary the moon and the tides should have been\ninquired into at the very instant of the creation.\nYou will observe farther, that the sun, which in France is said to have\nnothing to do in the affair, comes in here for very near a quarter of its\nassistance.  According to your Cartesians, everything is performed by an\nimpulsion, of which we have very little notion; and according to Sir\nIsaac Newton, it is by an attraction, the cause of which is as much\nunknown to us.  At Paris you imagine that the earth is shaped like a\nmelon, or of an oblique figure; at London it has an oblate one.  A\nCartesian declares that light exists in the air; but a Newtonian asserts\nthat it comes from the sun in six minutes and a half.  The several\noperations of your chemistry are performed by acids, alkalies and subtile\nmatter; but attraction prevails even in chemistry among the English.\nThe very essence of things is totally changed.  You neither are agreed\nupon the definition of the soul, nor on that of matter.  Descartes, as I\nobserved in my last, maintains that the soul is the same thing with\nthought, and Mr. Locke has given a pretty good proof of the contrary.\nDescartes asserts farther, that extension alone constitutes matter, but\nSir Isaac adds solidity to it.\nHow furiously contradictory are these opinions!\n\"Non nostrum inter vos tantas componere lites.\"\nVIRGIL, Eclog. III.\n\"'Tis not for us to end such great disputes.\"\nThis famous Newton, this destroyer of the Cartesian system, died in\nMarch, anno 1727.  His countrymen honoured him in his lifetime, and\ninterred him as though he had been a king who had made his people happy.\nThe English read with the highest satisfaction, and translated into their\ntongue, the Elogium of Sir Isaac Newton, which M. de Fontenelle spoke in\nthe Academy of Sciences.  M. de Fontenelle presides as judge over\nphilosophers; and the English expected his decision, as a solemn\ndeclaration of the superiority of the English philosophy over that of the\nFrench.  But when it was found that this gentleman had compared Descartes\nto Sir Isaac, the whole Royal Society in London rose up in arms.  So far\nfrom acquiescing with M. Fontenelle's judgment, they criticised his\ndiscourse.  And even several (who, however, were not the ablest\nphilosophers in that body) were offended at the comparison; and for no\nother reason but because Descartes was a Frenchman.\nIt must be confessed that these two great men differed very much in\nconduct, in fortune, and in philosophy.\nNature had indulged Descartes with a shining and strong imagination,\nwhence he became a very singular person both in private life and in his\nmanner of reasoning.  This imagination could not conceal itself even in\nhis philosophical works, which are everywhere adorned with very shining,\ningenious metaphors and figures.  Nature had almost made him a poet; and\nindeed he wrote a piece of poetry for the entertainment of Christina,\nQueen of Sweden, which however was suppressed in honour to his memory.\nHe embraced a military life for some time, and afterwards becoming a\ncomplete philosopher, he did not think the passion of love derogatory to\nhis character.  He had by his mistress a daughter called Froncine, who\ndied young, and was very much regretted by him.  Thus he experienced\nevery passion incident to mankind.\nHe was a long time of opinion that it would be necessary for him to fly\nfrom the society of his fellow creatures, and especially from his native\ncountry, in order to enjoy the happiness of cultivating his philosophical\nstudies in full liberty.\nDescartes was very right, for his contemporaries were not knowing enough\nto improve and enlighten his understanding, and were capable of little\nelse than of giving him uneasiness.\nHe left France purely to go in search of truth, which was then persecuted\nby the wretched philosophy of the schools.  However, he found that reason\nwas as much disguised and depraved in the universities of Holland, into\nwhich he withdrew, as in his own country.  For at the time that the\nFrench condemned the only propositions of his philosophy which were true,\nhe was persecuted by the pretended philosophers of Holland, who\nunderstood him no better; and who, having a nearer view of his glory,\nhated his person the more, so that he was obliged to leave Utrecht.\nDescartes was injuriously accused of being an atheist, the last refuge of\nreligious scandal: and he who had employed all the sagacity and\npenetration of his genius, in searching for new proofs of the existence\nof a God, was suspected to believe there was no such Being.\nSuch a persecution from all sides, must necessarily suppose a most\nexalted merit as well as a very distinguished reputation, and indeed he\npossessed both.  Reason at that time darted a ray upon the world through\nthe gloom of the schools, and the prejudices of popular superstition.  At\nlast his name spread so universally, that the French were desirous of\nbringing him back into his native country by rewards, and accordingly\noffered him an annual pension of a thousand crowns.  Upon these hopes\nDescartes returned to France; paid the fees of his patent, which was sold\nat that time, but no pension was settled upon him.  Thus disappointed, he\nreturned to his solitude in North Holland, where he again pursued the\nstudy of philosophy, whilst the great Galileo, at fourscore years of age,\nwas groaning in the prisons of the Inquisition, only for having\ndemonstrated the earth's motion.\nAt last Descartes was snatched from the world in the flower of his age at\nStockholm.  His death was owing to a bad regimen, and he expired in the\nmidst of some literati who were his enemies, and under the hands of a\nphysician to whom he was odious.\nThe progress of Sir Isaac Newton's life was quite different.  He lived\nhappy, and very much honoured in his native country, to the age of\nfourscore and five years.\nIt was his peculiar felicity, not only to be born in a country of\nliberty, but in an age when all scholastic impertinences were banished\nfrom the world.  Reason alone was cultivated, and mankind could only be\nhis pupil, not his enemy.\nOne very singular difference in the lives of these two great men is, that\nSir Isaac, during the long course of years he enjoyed, was never sensible\nto any passion, was not subject to the common frailties of mankind, nor\never had any commerce with women--a circumstance which was assured me by\nthe physician and surgeon who attended him in his last moments.\nWe may admire Sir Isaac Newton on this occasion, but then we must not\ncensure Descartes.\nThe opinion that generally prevails in England with regard to these new\nphilosophers is, that the latter was a dreamer, and the former a sage.\nVery few people in England read Descartes, whose works indeed are now\nuseless.  On the other side, but a small number peruse those of Sir\nIsaac, because to do this the student must be deeply skilled in the\nmathematics, otherwise those works will be unintelligible to him.  But\nnotwithstanding this, these great men are the subject of everyone's\ndiscourse.  Sir Isaac Newton is allowed every advantage, whilst Descartes\nis not indulged a single one.  According to some, it is to the former\nthat we owe the discovery of a vacuum, that the air is a heavy body, and\nthe invention of telescopes.  In a word, Sir Isaac Newton is here as the\nHercules of fabulous story, to whom the ignorant ascribed all the feats\nof ancient heroes.\nIn a critique that was made in London on Mr. de Fontenelle's discourse,\nthe writer presumed to assert that Descartes was not a great\ngeometrician.  Those who make such a declaration may justly be reproached\nwith flying in their master's face.  Descartes extended the limits of\ngeometry as far beyond the place where he found them, as Sir Isaac did\nafter him.  The former first taught the method of expressing curves by\nequations.  This geometry which, thanks to him for it, is now grown\ncommon, was so abstruse in his time, that not so much as one professor\nwould undertake to explain it; and Schotten in Holland, and Format in\nFrance, were the only men who understood it.\nHe applied this geometrical and inventive genius to dioptrics, which,\nwhen treated of by him, became a new art.  And if he was mistaken in some\nthings, the reason of that is, a man who discovers a new tract of land\ncannot at once know all the properties of the soil.  Those who come after\nhim, and make these lands fruitful, are at least obliged to him for the\ndiscovery.  I will not deny but that there are innumerable errors in the\nrest of Descartes' works.\nGeometry was a guide he himself had in some measure fashioned, which\nwould have conducted him safely through the several paths of natural\nphilosophy.  Nevertheless, he at last abandoned this guide, and gave\nentirely into the humour of forming hypotheses; and then philosophy was\nno more than an ingenious romance, fit only to amuse the ignorant.  He\nwas mistaken in the nature of the soul, in the proofs of the existence of\na God, in matter, in the laws of motion, and in the nature of light.  He\nadmitted innate ideas, he invented new elements, he created a world; he\nmade man according to his own fancy; and it is justly said, that the man\nof Descartes is, in fact, that of Descartes only, very different from the\nreal one.\nHe pushed his metaphysical errors so far, as to declare that two and two\nmake four for no other reason but because God would have it so.  However,\nit will not be making him too great a compliment if we affirm that he was\nvaluable even in his mistakes.  He deceived himself; but then it was at\nleast in a methodical way.  He destroyed all the absurd chimeras with\nwhich youth had been infatuated for two thousand years.  He taught his\ncontemporaries how to reason, and enabled them to employ his own weapons\nagainst himself.  If Descartes did not pay in good money, he however did\ngreat service in crying down that of a base alloy.\nI indeed believe that very few will presume to compare his philosophy in\nany respect with that of Sir Isaac Newton.  The former is an essay, the\nlatter a masterpiece.  But then the man who first brought us to the path\nof truth, was perhaps as great a genius as he who afterwards conducted us\nthrough it.\nDescartes gave sight to the blind.  These saw the errors of antiquity and\nof the sciences.  The path he struck out is since become boundless.\nRohault's little work was, during some years, a complete system of\nphysics; but now all the Transactions of the several academies in Europe\nput together do not form so much as the beginning of a system.  In\nfathoming this abyss no bottom has been found.  We are now to examine\nwhat discoveries Sir Isaac Newton has made in it.\nLETTER XV.--ON ATTRACTION\nThe discoveries which gained Sir Isaac Newton so universal a reputation,\nrelate to the system of the world, to light, to geometrical infinities;\nand, lastly, to chronology, with which he used to amuse himself after the\nfatigue of his severer studies.\nI will now acquaint you (without prolixity if possible) with the few\nthings I have been able to comprehend of all these sublime ideas.  With\nregard to the system of our world, disputes were a long time maintained,\non the cause that turns the planets, and keeps them in their orbits: and\non those causes which make all bodies here below descend towards the\nsurface of the earth.\nThe system of Descartes, explained and improved since his time, seemed to\ngive a plausible reason for all those phenomena; and this reason seemed\nmore just, as it is simple and intelligible to all capacities.  But in\nphilosophy, a student ought to doubt of the things he fancies he\nunderstands too easily, as much as of those he does not understand.\nGravity, the falling of accelerated bodies on the earth, the revolution\nof the planets in their orbits, their rotations round their axis, all\nthis is mere motion.  Now motion cannot perhaps be conceived any\notherwise than by impulsion; therefore all those bodies must be impelled.\nBut by what are they impelled?  All space is full, it therefore is filled\nwith a very subtile matter, since this is imperceptible to us; this\nmatter goes from west to east, since all the planets are carried from\nwest to east.  Thus from hypothesis to hypothesis, from one appearance to\nanother, philosophers have imagined a vast whirlpool of subtile matter,\nin which the planets are carried round the sun: they also have created\nanother particular vortex which floats in the great one, and which turns\ndaily round the planets.  When all this is done, it is pretended that\ngravity depends on this diurnal motion; for, say these, the velocity of\nthe subtile matter that turns round our little vortex, must be seventeen\ntimes more rapid than that of the earth; or, in case its velocity is\nseventeen times greater than that of the earth, its centrifugal force\nmust be vastly greater, and consequently impel all bodies towards the\nearth.  This is the cause of gravity, according to the Cartesian system.\nBut the theorist, before he calculated the centrifugal force and velocity\nof the subtile matter, should first have been certain that it existed.\nSir Isaac Newton, seems to have destroyed all these great and little\nvortices, both that which carries the planets round the sun, as well as\nthe other which supposes every planet to turn on its own axis.\nFirst, with regard to the pretended little vortex of the earth, it is\ndemonstrated that it must lose its motion by insensible degrees; it is\ndemonstrated, that if the earth swims in a fluid, its density must be\nequal to that of the earth; and in case its density be the same, all the\nbodies we endeavour to move must meet with an insuperable resistance.\nWith regard to the great vortices, they are still more chimerical, and it\nis impossible to make them agree with Kepler's law, the truth of which\nhas been demonstrated.  Sir Isaac shows, that the revolution of the fluid\nin which Jupiter is supposed to be carried, is not the same with regard\nto the revolution of the fluid of the earth, as the revolution of Jupiter\nwith respect to that of the earth.  He proves, that as the planets make\ntheir revolutions in ellipses, and consequently being at a much greater\ndistance one from the other in their Aphelia, and a little nearer in\ntheir Perihelia; the earth's velocity, for instance, ought to be greater\nwhen it is nearer Venus and Mars, because the fluid that carries it\nalong, being then more pressed, ought to have a greater motion; and yet\nit is even then that the earth's motion is slower.\nHe proves that there is no such thing as a celestial matter which goes\nfrom west to east since the comets traverse those spaces, sometimes from\neast to west, and at other times from north to south.\nIn fine, the better to resolve, if possible, every difficulty, he proves,\nand even by experiments, that it is impossible there should be a plenum;\nand brings back the vacuum, which Aristotle and Descartes had banished\nfrom the world.\nHaving by these and several other arguments destroyed the Cartesian\nvortices, he despaired of ever being able to discover whether there is a\nsecret principle in nature which, at the same time, is the cause of the\nmotion of all celestial bodies, and that of gravity on the earth.  But\nbeing retired in 1666, upon account of the Plague, to a solitude near\nCambridge; as he was walking one day in his garden, and saw some fruits\nfall from a tree, he fell into a profound meditation on that gravity, the\ncause of which had so long been sought, but in vain, by all the\nphilosophers, whilst the vulgar think there is nothing mysterious in it.\nHe said to himself; that from what height soever in our hemisphere, those\nbodies might descend, their fall would certainly be in the progression\ndiscovered by Galileo; and the spaces they run through would be as the\nsquare of the times.  Why may not this power which causes heavy bodies to\ndescend, and is the same without any sensible diminution at the remotest\ndistance from the centre of the earth, or on the summits of the highest\nmountains, why, said Sir Isaac, may not this power extend as high as the\nmoon?  And in case its influence reaches so far, is it not very probable\nthat this power retains it in its orbit, and determines its motion?  But\nin case the moon obeys this principle (whatever it be) may we not\nconclude very naturally that the rest of the planets are equally subject\nto it?  In case this power exists (which besides is proved) it must\nincrease in an inverse ratio of the squares of the distances.  All,\ntherefore, that remains is, to examine how far a heavy body, which should\nfall upon the earth from a moderate height, would go; and how far in the\nsame time, a body which should fall from the orbit of the moon, would\ndescend.  To find this, nothing is wanted but the measure of the earth,\nand the distance of the moon from it.\nThus Sir Isaac Newton reasoned.  But at that time the English had but a\nvery imperfect measure of our globe, and depended on the uncertain\nsupposition of mariners, who computed a degree to contain but sixty\nEnglish miles, whereas it consists in reality of near seventy.  As this\nfalse computation did not agree with the conclusions which Sir Isaac\nintended to draw from them, he laid aside this pursuit.  A half-learned\nphilosopher, remarkable only for his vanity, would have made the measure\nof the earth agree, anyhow, with his system.  Sir Isaac, however, chose\nrather to quit the researches he was then engaged in.  But after Mr.\nPicard had measured the earth exactly, by tracing that meridian which\nredounds so much to the honour of the French, Sir Isaac Newton resumed\nhis former reflections, and found his account in Mr. Picard's\ncalculation.\nA circumstance which has always appeared wonderful to me, is that such\nsublime discoveries should have been made by the sole assistance of a\nquadrant and a little arithmetic.\nThe circumference of the earth is 123,249,600 feet.  This, among other\nthings, is necessary to prove the system of attraction.\nThe instant we know the earth's circumference, and the distance of the\nmoon, we know that of the moon's orbit, and the diameter of this orbit.\nThe moon performs its revolution in that orbit in twenty-seven days,\nseven hours, forty-three minutes.  It is demonstrated, that the moon in\nits mean motion makes an hundred and fourscore and seven thousand nine\nhundred and sixty feet (of Paris) in a minute.  It is likewise\ndemonstrated, by a known theorem, that the central force which should\nmake a body fall from the height of the moon, would make its velocity no\nmore than fifteen Paris feet in a minute of time.  Now, if the law by\nwhich bodies gravitate and attract one another in an inverse ratio to the\nsquares of the distances be true, if the same power acts according to\nthat law throughout all nature, it is evident that as the earth is sixty\nsemi-diameters distant from the moon, a heavy body must necessarily fall\n(on the earth) fifteen feet in the first second, and fifty-four thousand\nfeet in the first minute.\nNow a heavy body falls, in reality, fifteen feet in the first second, and\ngoes in the first minute fifty-four thousand feet, which number is the\nsquare of sixty multiplied by fifteen.  Bodies, therefore, gravitate in\nan inverse ratio of the squares of the distances; consequently, what\ncauses gravity on earth, and keeps the moon in its orbit, is one and the\nsame power; it being demonstrated that the moon gravitates on the earth,\nwhich is the centre of its particular motion, it is demonstrated that the\nearth and the moon gravitate on the sun which is the centre of their\nannual motion.\nThe rest of the planets must be subject to this general law; and if this\nlaw exists, these planets must follow the laws which Kepler discovered.\nAll these laws, all these relations are indeed observed by the planets\nwith the utmost exactness; therefore, the power of attraction causes all\nthe planets to gravitate towards the sun, in like manner as the moon\ngravitates towards our globe.\nFinally, as in all bodies re-action is equal to action, it is certain\nthat the earth gravitates also towards the moon; and that the sun\ngravitates towards both.  That every one of the satellites of Saturn\ngravitates towards the other four, and the other four towards it; all\nfive towards Saturn, and Saturn towards all.  That it is the same with\nregard to Jupiter; and that all these globes are attracted by the sun,\nwhich is reciprocally attracted by them.\nThis power of gravitation acts proportionably to the quantity of matter\nin bodies, a truth which Sir Isaac has demonstrated by experiments.  This\nnew discovery has been of use to show that the sun (the centre of the\nplanetary system) attracts them all in a direct ratio of their quantity\nof matter combined with their nearness.  From hence Sir Isaac, rising by\ndegrees to discoveries which seemed not to be formed for the human mind,\nis bold enough to compute the quantity of matter contained in the sun and\nin every planet; and in this manner shows, from the simple laws of\nmechanics, that every celestial globe ought necessarily to be where it is\nplaced.\nHis bare principle of the laws of gravitation accounts for all the\napparent inequalities in the course of the celestial globes.  The\nvariations of the moon are a necessary consequence of those laws.\nMoreover, the reason is evidently seen why the nodes of the moon perform\ntheir revolutions in nineteen years, and those of the earth in about\ntwenty-six thousand.  The several appearances observed in the tides are\nalso a very simple effect of this attraction.  The proximity of the moon,\nwhen at the full, and when it is new, and its distance in the quadratures\nor quarters, combined with the action of the sun, exhibit a sensible\nreason why the ocean swells and sinks.\nAfter having shown by his sublime theory the course and inequalities of\nthe planets, he subjects comets to the same law.  The orbit of these\nfires (unknown for so great a series of years), which was the terror of\nmankind and the rock against which philosophy split, placed by Aristotle\nbelow the moon, and sent back by Descartes above the sphere of Saturn, is\nat last placed in its proper seat by Sir Isaac Newton.\nHe proves that comets are solid bodies which move in the sphere of the\nsun's activity, and that they describe an ellipsis so very eccentric, and\nso near to parabolas, that certain comets must take up above five hundred\nyears in their revolution.\nThe learned Dr. Halley is of opinion that the comet seen in 1680 is the\nsame which appeared in Julius Caesar's time.  This shows more than any\nother that comets are hard, opaque bodies; for it descended so near to\nthe sun, as to come within a sixth part of the diameter of this planet\nfrom it, and consequently might have contracted a degree of heat two\nthousand times stronger than that of red-hot iron; and would have been\nsoon dispersed in vapour, had it not been a firm, dense body.  The\nguessing the course of comets began then to be very much in vogue.  The\ncelebrated Bernoulli concluded by his system that the famous comet of\n1680 would appear again the 17th of May, 1719.  Not a single astronomer\nin Europe went to bed that night.  However, they needed not to have broke\ntheir rest, for the famous comet never appeared.  There is at least more\ncunning, if not more certainty, in fixing its return to so remote a\ndistance as five hundred and seventy-five years.  As to Mr. Whiston, he\naffirmed very seriously that in the time of the Deluge a comet overflowed\nthe terrestrial globe.  And he was so unreasonable as to wonder that\npeople laughed at him for making such an assertion.  The ancients were\nalmost in the same way of thinking with Mr. Whiston, and fancied that\ncomets were always the forerunners of some great calamity which was to\nbefall mankind.  Sir Isaac Newton, on the contrary, suspected that they\nare very beneficent, and that vapours exhale from them merely to nourish\nand vivify the planets, which imbibe in their course the several\nparticles the sun has detached from the comets, an opinion which, at\nleast, is more probable than the former.  But this is not all.  If this\npower of gravitation or attraction acts on all the celestial globes, it\nacts undoubtedly on the several parts of these globes.  For in case\nbodies attract one another in proportion to the quantity of matter\ncontained in them, it can only be in proportion to the quantity of their\nparts; and if this power is found in the whole, it is undoubtedly in the\nhalf; in the quarters in the eighth part, and so on in _infinitum_.\nThis is attraction, the great spring by which all Nature is moved.  Sir\nIsaac Newton, after having demonstrated the existence of this principle,\nplainly foresaw that its very name would offend; and, therefore, this\nphilosopher, in more places than one of his books, gives the reader some\ncaution about it.  He bids him beware of confounding this name with what\nthe ancients called occult qualities, but to be satisfied with knowing\nthat there is in all bodies a central force, which acts to the utmost\nlimits of the universe, according to the invariable laws of mechanics.\nIt is surprising, after the solemn protestations Sir Isaac made, that\nsuch eminent men as Mr. Sorin and Mr. de Fontenelle should have imputed\nto this great philosopher the verbal and chimerical way of reasoning of\nthe Aristotelians; Mr. Sorin in the Memoirs of the Academy of 1709, and\nMr. de Fontenelle in the very eulogium of Sir Isaac Newton.\nMost of the French (the learned and others) have repeated this reproach.\nThese are for ever crying out, \"Why did he not employ the word\n_impulsion_, which is so well understood, rather than that of\n_attraction_, which is unintelligible?\"\nSir Isaac might have answered these critics thus:--\"First, you have as\nimperfect an idea of the word impulsion as of that of attraction; and in\ncase you cannot conceive how one body tends towards the centre of another\nbody, neither can you conceive by what power one body can impel another.\n\"Secondly, I could not admit of impulsion; for to do this I must have\nknown that a celestial matter was the agent.  But so far from knowing\nthat there is any such matter, I have proved it to be merely imaginary.\n\"Thirdly, I use the word attraction for no other reason but to express an\neffect which I discovered in Nature--a certain and indisputable effect of\nan unknown principle--a quality inherent in matter, the cause of which\npersons of greater abilities than I can pretend to may, if they can, find\nout.\"\n\"What have you, then, taught us?\" will these people say further; \"and to\nwhat purpose are so many calculations to tell us what you yourself do not\ncomprehend?\"\n\"I have taught you,\" may Sir Isaac rejoin, \"that all bodies gravitate\ntowards one another in proportion to their quantity of matter; that these\ncentral forces alone keep the planets and comets in their orbits, and\ncause them to move in the proportion before set down.  I demonstrate to\nyou that it is impossible there should be any other cause which keeps the\nplanets in their orbits than that general phenomenon of gravity.  For\nheavy bodies fall on the earth according to the proportion demonstrated\nof central forces; and the planets finishing their course according to\nthese same proportions, in case there were another power that acted upon\nall those bodies, it would either increase their velocity or change their\ndirection.  Now, not one of those bodies ever has a single degree of\nmotion or velocity, or has any direction but what is demonstrated to be\nthe effect of the central forces.  Consequently it is impossible there\nshould be any other principle.\"\nGive me leave once more to introduce Sir Isaac speaking.  Shall he not be\nallowed to say? \"My case and that of the ancients is very different.\nThese saw, for instance, water ascend in pumps, and said, 'The water\nrises because it abhors a vacuum.'  But with regard to myself; I am in\nthe case of a man who should have first observed that water ascends in\npumps, but should leave others to explain the cause of this effect.  The\nanatomist, who first declared that the motion of the arm is owing to the\ncontraction of the muscles, taught mankind an indisputable truth.  But\nare they less obliged to him because he did not know the reason why the\nmuscles contract?  The cause of the elasticity of the air is unknown, but\nhe who first discovered this spring performed a very signal service to\nnatural philosophy.  The spring that I discovered was more hidden and\nmore universal, and for that very reason mankind ought to thank me the\nmore.  I have discovered a new property of matter--one of the secrets of\nthe Creator--and have calculated and discovered the effects of it.  After\nthis, shall people quarrel with me about the name I give it?\"\nVortices may be called an occult quality, because their existence was\nnever proved.  Attraction, on the contrary, is a real thing, because its\neffects are demonstrated, and the proportions of it are calculated.  The\ncause of this cause is among the _Arcana_ of the Almighty.\n\"Precedes huc, et non amplius.\"\n(Thus far shalt thou go, and no farther.)\nLETTER XVI.--ON SIR ISAAC NEWTON'S OPTICS\nThe philosophers of the last age found out a new universe; and a\ncircumstance which made its discovery more difficult was that no one had\nso much as suspected its existence.  The most sage and judicious were of\nopinion that it was a frantic rashness to dare so much as to imagine that\nit was possible to guess the laws by which the celestial bodies move and\nthe manner how light acts.  Galileo, by his astronomical discoveries,\nKepler, by his calculation, Descartes (at least, in his dioptrics), and\nSir Isaac Newton, in all his works, severally saw the mechanism of the\nsprings of the world.  The geometricians have subjected infinity to the\nlaws of calculation.  The circulation of the blood in animals, and of the\nsap in vegetables, have changed the face of Nature with regard to us.  A\nnew kind of existence has been given to bodies in the air-pump.  By the\nassistance of telescopes bodies have been brought nearer to one another.\nFinally, the several discoveries which Sir Isaac Newton has made on light\nare equal to the boldest things which the curiosity of man could expect\nafter so many philosophical novelties.\nTill Antonio de Dominis the rainbow was considered as an inexplicable\nmiracle.  This philosopher guessed that it was a necessary effect of the\nsun and rain.  Descartes gained immortal fame by his mathematical\nexplication of this so natural a phenomenon.  He calculated the\nreflections and refractions of light in drops of rain.  And his sagacity\non this occasion was at that time looked upon as next to divine.\nBut what would he have said had it been proved to him that he was\nmistaken in the nature of light; that he had not the least reason to\nmaintain that it is a globular body?  That it is false to assert that\nthis matter, spreading itself through the whole, waits only to be\nprojected forward by the sun, in order to be put in action, in like\nmanner as a long staff acts at one end when pushed forward by the other.\nThat light is certainly darted by the sun; in fine, that light is\ntransmitted from the sun to the earth in about seven minutes, though a\ncannonball, which were not to lose any of its velocity, could not go that\ndistance in less than twenty-five years.  How great would have been his\nastonishment had he been told that light does not reflect directly by\nimpinging against the solid parts of bodies, that bodies are not\ntransparent when they have large pores, and that a man should arise who\nwould demonstrate all these paradoxes, and anatomise a single ray of\nlight with more dexterity than the ablest artist dissects a human body.\nThis man is come.  Sir Isaac Newton has demonstrated to the eye, by the\nbare assistance of the prism, that light is a composition of coloured\nrays, which, being united, form white colour.  A single ray is by him\ndivided into seven, which all fall upon a piece of linen, or a sheet of\nwhite paper, in their order, one above the other, and at unequal\ndistances.  The first is red, the second orange, the third yellow, the\nfourth green, the fifth blue, the sixth indigo, the seventh a\nviolet-purple.  Each of these rays, transmitted afterwards by a hundred\nother prisms, will never change the colour it bears; in like manner, as\ngold, when completely purged from its dross, will never change afterwards\nin the crucible.  As a superabundant proof that each of these elementary\nrays has inherently in itself that which forms its colour to the eye,\ntake a small piece of yellow wood, for instance, and set it in the ray of\na red colour; this wood will instantly be tinged red.  But set it in the\nray of a green colour, it assumes a green colour, and so of all the rest.\nFrom what cause, therefore, do colours arise in Nature?  It is nothing\nbut the disposition of bodies to reflect the rays of a certain order and\nto absorb all the rest.\nWhat, then, is this secret disposition?  Sir Isaac Newton demonstrates\nthat it is nothing more than the density of the small constituent\nparticles of which a body is composed.  And how is this reflection\nperformed?  It was supposed to arise from the rebounding of the rays, in\nthe same manner as a ball on the surface of a solid body.  But this is a\nmistake, for Sir Isaac taught the astonished philosophers that bodies are\nopaque for no other reason but because their pores are large, that light\nreflects on our eyes from the very bosom of those pores, that the smaller\nthe pores of a body are the more such a body is transparent.  Thus paper,\nwhich reflects the light when dry, transmits it when oiled, because the\noil, by filling its pores, makes them much smaller.\nIt is there that examining the vast porosity of bodies, every particle\nhaving its pores, and every particle of those particles having its own,\nhe shows we are not certain that there is a cubic inch of solid matter in\nthe universe, so far are we from conceiving what matter is.  Having thus\ndivided, as it were, light into its elements, and carried the sagacity of\nhis discoveries so far as to prove the method of distinguishing compound\ncolours from such as are primitive, he shows that these elementary rays,\nseparated by the prism, are ranged in their order for no other reason but\nbecause they are refracted in that very order; and it is this property\n(unknown till he discovered it) of breaking or splitting in this\nproportion; it is this unequal refraction of rays, this power of\nrefracting the red less than the orange colour, &c., which he calls the\ndifferent refrangibility.  The most reflexible rays are the most\nrefrangible, and from hence he evinces that the same power is the cause\nboth of the reflection and refraction of light.\nBut all these wonders are merely but the opening of his discoveries.  He\nfound out the secret to see the vibrations or fits of light which come\nand go incessantly, and which either transmit light or reflect it,\naccording to the density of the parts they meet with.  He has presumed to\ncalculate the density of the particles of air necessary between two\nglasses, the one flat, the other convex on one side, set one upon the\nother, in order to operate such a transmission or reflection, or to form\nsuch and such a colour.\nFrom all these combinations he discovers the proportion in which light\nacts on bodies and bodies act on light.\nHe saw light so perfectly, that he has determined to what degree of\nperfection the art of increasing it, and of assisting our eyes by\ntelescopes, can be carried.\nDescartes, from a noble confidence that was very excusable, considering\nhow strongly he was fired at the first discoveries he made in an art\nwhich he almost first found out; Descartes, I say, hoped to discover in\nthe stars, by the assistance of telescopes, objects as small as those we\ndiscern upon the earth.\nBut Sir Isaac has shown that dioptric telescopes cannot be brought to a\ngreater perfection, because of that refraction, and of that very\nrefrangibility, which at the same time that they bring objects nearer to\nus, scatter too much the elementary rays.  He has calculated in these\nglasses the proportion of the scattering of the red and of the blue rays;\nand proceeding so far as to demonstrate things which were not supposed\neven to exist, he examines the inequalities which arise from the shape or\nfigure of the glass, and that which arises from the refrangibility.  He\nfinds that the object glass of the telescope being convex on one side and\nflat on the other, in case the flat side be turned towards the object,\nthe error which arises from the construction and position of the glass is\nabove five thousand times less than the error which arises from the\nrefrangibility; and, therefore, that the shape or figure of the glasses\nis not the cause why telescopes cannot be carried to a greater\nperfection, but arises wholly from the nature of light.\nFor this reason he invented a telescope, which discovers objects by\nreflection, and not by refraction.  Telescopes of this new kind are very\nhard to make, and their use is not easy; but, according to the English, a\nreflective telescope of but five feet has the same effect as another of a\nhundred feet in length.\nLETTER XVII.--ON INFINITES IN GEOMETRY, AND SIR ISAAC NEWTON'S CHRONOLOGY\nThe labyrinth and abyss of infinity is also a new course Sir Isaac Newton\nhas gone through, and we are obliged to him for the clue, by whose\nassistance we are enabled to trace its various windings.\nDescartes got the start of him also in this astonishing invention.  He\nadvanced with mighty steps in his geometry, and was arrived at the very\nborders of infinity, but went no farther.  Dr. Wallis, about the middle\nof the last century, was the first who reduced a fraction by a perpetual\ndivision to an infinite series.\nThe Lord Brouncker employed this series to square the hyperbola.\nMercator published a demonstration of this quadrature; much about which\ntime Sir Isaac Newton, being then twenty-three years of age, had invented\na general method, to perform on all geometrical curves what had just\nbefore been tried on the hyperbola.\nIt is to this method of subjecting everywhere infinity to algebraical\ncalculations, that the name is given of differential calculations or of\nfluxions and integral calculation.  It is the art of numbering and\nmeasuring exactly a thing whose existence cannot be conceived.\nAnd, indeed, would you not imagine that a man laughed at you who should\ndeclare that there are lines infinitely great which form an angle\ninfinitely little?\nThat a right line, which is a right line so long as it is finite, by\nchanging infinitely little its direction, becomes an infinite curve; and\nthat a curve may become infinitely less than another curve?\nThat there are infinite squares, infinite cubes, and infinites of\ninfinites, all greater than one another, and the last but one of which is\nnothing in comparison of the last?\nAll these things, which at first appear to be the utmost excess of\nfrenzy, are in reality an effort of the subtlety and extent of the human\nmind, and the art of finding truths which till then had been unknown.\nThis so bold edifice is even founded on simple ideas.  The business is to\nmeasure the diagonal of a square, to give the area of a curve, to find\nthe square root of a number, which has none in common arithmetic.  After\nall, the imagination ought not to be startled any more at so many orders\nof infinites than at the so well-known proposition, viz., that curve\nlines may always be made to pass between a circle and a tangent; or at\nthat other, namely, that matter is divisible in _infinitum_.  These two\ntruths have been demonstrated many years, and are no less\nincomprehensible than the things we have been speaking of.\nFor many years the invention of this famous calculation was denied to Sir\nIsaac Newton.  In Germany Mr. Leibnitz was considered as the inventor of\nthe differences or moments, called fluxions, and Mr. Bernouilli claimed\nthe integral calculus.  However, Sir Isaac is now thought to have first\nmade the discovery, and the other two have the glory of having once made\nthe world doubt whether it was to be ascribed to him or them.  Thus some\ncontested with Dr. Harvey the invention of the circulation of the blood,\nas others disputed with Mr. Perrault that of the circulation of the sap.\nHartsocher and Leuwenhoek disputed with each other the honour of having\nfirst seen the _vermiculi_ of which mankind are formed.  This Hartsocher\nalso contested with Huygens the invention of a new method of calculating\nthe distance of a fixed star.  It is not yet known to what philosopher we\nowe the invention of the cycloid.\nBe this as it will, it is by the help of this geometry of infinites that\nSir Isaac Newton attained to the most sublime discoveries.  I am now to\nspeak of another work, which, though more adapted to the capacity of the\nhuman mind, does nevertheless display some marks of that creative genius\nwith which Sir Isaac Newton was informed in all his researches.  The work\nI mean is a chronology of a new kind, for what province soever he\nundertook he was sure to change the ideas and opinions received by the\nrest of men.\nAccustomed to unravel and disentangle chaos, he was resolved to convey at\nleast some light into that of the fables of antiquity which are blended\nand confounded with history, and fix an uncertain chronology.  It is true\nthat there is no family, city, or nation, but endeavours to remove its\noriginal as far backward as possible.  Besides, the first historians were\nthe most negligent in setting down the eras: books were infinitely less\ncommon than they are at this time, and, consequently, authors being not\nso obnoxious to censure, they therefore imposed upon the world with\ngreater impunity; and, as it is evident that these have related a great\nnumber of fictitious particulars, it is probable enough that they also\ngave us several false eras.\nIt appeared in general to Sir Isaac that the world was five hundred years\nyounger than chronologers declare it to be.  He grounds his opinion on\nthe ordinary course of Nature, and on the observations which astronomers\nhave made.\nBy the course of Nature we here understand the time that every generation\nof men lives upon the earth.  The Egyptians first employed this vague and\nuncertain method of calculating when they began to write the beginning of\ntheir history.  These computed three hundred and forty-one generations\nfrom Menes to Sethon; and, having no fixed era, they supposed three\ngenerations to consist of a hundred years.  In this manner they computed\neleven thousand three hundred and forty years from Menes's reign to that\nof Sethon.\nThe Greeks before they counted by Olympiads followed the method of the\nEgyptians, and even gave a little more extent to generations, making each\nto consist of forty years.\nNow, here, both the Egyptians and the Greeks made an erroneous\ncomputation.  It is true, indeed, that, according to the usual course of\nNature, three generations last about a hundred and twenty years; but\nthree reigns are far from taking up so many.  It is very evident that\nmankind in general live longer than kings are found to reign, so that an\nauthor who should write a history in which there were no dates fixed, and\nshould know that nine kings had reigned over a nation; such an historian\nwould commit a great error should he allow three hundred years to these\nnine monarchs.  Every generation takes about thirty-six years; every\nreign is, one with the other, about twenty.  Thirty kings of England have\nswayed the sceptre from William the Conqueror to George I., the years of\nwhose reigns added together amount to six hundred and forty-eight years;\nwhich, being divided equally among the thirty kings, give to every one a\nreign of twenty-one years and a half very near.  Sixty-three kings of\nFrance have sat upon the throne; these have, one with another, reigned\nabout twenty years each.  This is the usual course of Nature.  The\nancients, therefore, were mistaken when they supposed the durations in\ngeneral of reigns to equal that of generations.  They, therefore, allowed\ntoo great a number of years, and consequently some years must be\nsubtracted from their computation.\nAstronomical observations seem to have lent a still greater assistance to\nour philosopher.  He appears to us stronger when he fights upon his own\nground.\nYou know that the earth, besides its annual motion which carries it round\nthe sun from west to east in the space of a year, has also a singular\nrevolution which was quite unknown till within these late years.  Its\npoles have a very slow retrograde motion from east to west, whence it\nhappens that their position every day does not correspond exactly with\nthe same point of the heavens.  This difference, which is so insensible\nin a year, becomes pretty considerable in time; and in threescore and\ntwelve years the difference is found to be of one degree, that is to say,\nthe three hundred and sixtieth part of the circumference of the whole\nheaven.  Thus after seventy-two years the colure of the vernal equinox\nwhich passed through a fixed star, corresponds with another fixed star.\nHence it is that the sun, instead of being in that part of the heavens in\nwhich the Ram was situated in the time of Hipparchus, is found to\ncorrespond with that part of the heavens in which the Bull was situated;\nand the Twins are placed where the Bull then stood.  All the signs have\nchanged their situation, and yet we still retain the same manner of\nspeaking as the ancients did.  In this age we say that the sun is in the\nRam in the spring, from the same principle of condescension that we say\nthat the sun turns round.\nHipparchus was the first among the Greeks who observed some change in the\nconstellations with regard to the equinoxes, or rather who learnt it from\nthe Egyptians.  Philosophers ascribed this motion to the stars; for in\nthose ages people were far from imagining such a revolution in the earth,\nwhich was supposed to be immovable in every respect.  They therefore\ncreated a heaven in which they fixed the several stars, and gave this\nheaven a particular motion by which it was carried towards the east,\nwhilst that all the stars seemed to perform their diurnal revolution from\neast to west.  To this error they added a second of much greater\nconsequence, by imagining that the pretended heaven of the fixed stars\nadvanced one degree eastward every hundred years.  In this manner they\nwere no less mistaken in their astronomical calculation than in their\nsystem of natural philosophy.  As for instance, an astronomer in that age\nwould have said that the vernal equinox was in the time of such and such\nan observation, in such a sign, and in such a star.  It has advanced two\ndegrees of each since the time that observation was made to the present.\nNow two degrees are equivalent to two hundred years; consequently the\nastronomer who made that observation lived just so many years before me.\nIt is certain that an astronomer who had argued in this manner would have\nmistook just fifty-four years; hence it is that the ancients, who were\ndoubly deceived, made their great year of the world, that is, the\nrevolution of the whole heavens, to consist of thirty-six thousand years.\nBut the moderns are sensible that this imaginary revolution of the heaven\nof the stars is nothing else than the revolution of the poles of the\nearth, which is performed in twenty-five thousand nine hundred years.  It\nmay be proper to observe transiently in this place, that Sir Isaac, by\ndetermining the figure of the earth, has very happily explained the cause\nof this revolution.\nAll this being laid down, the only thing remaining to settle chronology\nis to see through what star the colure of the equinoxes passes, and where\nit intersects at this time the ecliptic in the spring; and to discover\nwhether some ancient writer does not tell us in what point the ecliptic\nwas intersected in his time, by the same colure of the equinoxes.\nClemens Alexandrinus informs us, that Chiron, who went with the\nArgonauts, observed the constellations at the time of that famous\nexpedition, and fixed the vernal equinox to the middle of the Ram; the\nautumnal equinox to the middle of Libra; our summer solstice to the\nmiddle of Cancer, and our winter solstice to the middle of Capricorn.\nA long time after the expedition of the Argonauts, and a year before the\nPeloponnesian war, Methon observed that the point of the summer solstice\npassed through the eighth degree of Cancer.\nNow every sign of the zodiac contains thirty degrees.  In Chiron's time,\nthe solstice was arrived at the middle of the sign, that is to say to the\nfifteenth degree.  A year before the Peloponnesian war it was at the\neighth, and therefore it had retarded seven degrees.  A degree is\nequivalent to seventy-two years; consequently, from the beginning of the\nPeloponnesian war to the expedition of the Argonauts, there is no more\nthan an interval of seven times seventy-two years, which make five\nhundred and four years, and not seven hundred years as the Greeks\ncomputed.  Thus in comparing the position of the heavens at this time\nwith their position in that age, we find that the expedition of the\nArgonauts ought to be placed about nine hundred years before Christ, and\nnot about fourteen hundred; and consequently that the world is not so old\nby five hundred years as it was generally supposed to be.  By this\ncalculation all the eras are drawn nearer, and the several events are\nfound to have happened later than is computed.  I do not know whether\nthis ingenious system will be favourably received; and whether these\nnotions will prevail so far with the learned, as to prompt them to reform\nthe chronology of the world.  Perhaps these gentlemen would think it too\ngreat a condescension to allow one and the same man the glory of having\nimproved natural philosophy, geometry, and history.  This would be a kind\nof universal monarchy, with which the principle of self-love that is in\nman will scarce suffer him to indulge his fellow-creature; and, indeed,\nat the same time that some very great philosophers attacked Sir Isaac\nNewton's attractive principle, others fell upon his chronological system.\nTime that should discover to which of these the victory is due, may\nperhaps only leave the dispute still more undetermined.\nLETTER XVIII.--ON TRAGEDY\nThe English as well as the Spaniards were possessed of theatres at a time\nwhen the French had no more than moving, itinerant stages.  Shakspeare,\nwho was considered as the Corneille of the first-mentioned nation, was\npretty nearly contemporary with Lopez de Vega, and he created, as it\nwere, the English theatre.  Shakspeare boasted a strong fruitful genius.\nHe was natural and sublime, but had not so much as a single spark of good\ntaste, or knew one rule of the drama.  I will now hazard a random, but,\nat the same time, true reflection, which is, that the great merit of this\ndramatic poet has been the ruin of the English stage.  There are such\nbeautiful, such noble, such dreadful scenes in this writer's monstrous\nfarces, to which the name of tragedy is given, that they have always been\nexhibited with great success.  Time, which alone gives reputation to\nwriters, at last makes their very faults venerable.  Most of the\nwhimsical gigantic images of this poet, have, through length of time (it\nbeing a hundred and fifty years since they were first drawn) acquired a\nright of passing for sublime.  Most of the modern dramatic writers have\ncopied him; but the touches and descriptions which are applauded in\nShakspeare, are hissed at in these writers; and you will easily believe\nthat the veneration in which this author is held, increases in proportion\nto the contempt which is shown to the moderns.  Dramatic writers don't\nconsider that they should not imitate him; and the ill-success of\nShakspeare's imitators produces no other effect, than to make him be\nconsidered as inimitable.  You remember that in the tragedy of _Othello,\nMoor of Venice_, a most tender piece, a man strangles his wife on the\nstage, and that the poor woman, whilst she is strangling, cries aloud\nthat she dies very unjustly.  You know that in _Hamlet, Prince of\nDenmark_, two grave-diggers make a grave, and are all the time drinking,\nsinging ballads, and making humorous reflections (natural indeed enough\nto persons of their profession) on the several skulls they throw up with\ntheir spades; but a circumstance which will surprise you is, that this\nridiculous incident has been imitated.  In the reign of King Charles II.,\nwhich was that of politeness, and the Golden Age of the liberal arts;\nOtway, in his _Venice Preserved_, introduces Antonio the senator, and\nNaki, his courtesan, in the midst of the horrors of the Marquis of\nBedemar's conspiracy.  Antonio, the superannuated senator plays, in his\nmistress's presence, all the apish tricks of a lewd, impotent debauchee,\nwho is quite frantic and out of his senses.  He mimics a bull and a dog,\nand bites his mistress's legs, who kicks and whips him.  However, the\nplayers have struck these buffooneries (which indeed were calculated\nmerely for the dregs of the people) out of Otway's tragedy; but they have\nstill left in Shakspeare's _Julius Caesar_ the jokes of the Roman\nshoemakers and cobblers, who are introduced in the same scene with Brutus\nand Cassius.  You will undoubtedly complain, that those who have hitherto\ndiscoursed with you on the English stage, and especially on the\ncelebrated Shakspeare, have taken notice only of his errors; and that no\none has translated any of those strong, those forcible passages which\natone for all his faults.  But to this I will answer, that nothing is\neasier than to exhibit in prose all the silly impertinences which a poet\nmay have thrown out; but that it is a very difficult task to translate\nhis fine verses.  All your junior academical sophs, who set up for\ncensors of the eminent writers, compile whole volumes; but methinks two\npages which display some of the beauties of great geniuses, are of\ninfinitely more value than all the idle rhapsodies of those commentators;\nand I will join in opinion with all persons of good taste in declaring,\nthat greater advantage may be reaped from a dozen verses of Homer of\nVirgil, than from all the critiques put together which have been made on\nthose two great poets.\nI have ventured to translate some passages of the most celebrated English\npoets, and shall now give you one from Shakspeare.  Pardon the blemishes\nof the translation for the sake of the original; and remember always that\nwhen you see a version, you see merely a faint print of a beautiful\npicture.  I have made choice of part of the celebrated soliloquy in\n_Hamlet_, which you may remember is as follows:--\n\"To be, or not to be? that is the question!\nWhether 't is nobler in the mind to suffer\nThe slings and arrows of outrageous fortune,\nOr to take arms against a sea of troubles,\nAnd by opposing, end them?  To die! to sleep!\nNo more! and by a sleep to say we end\nThe heart-ache, and the thousand natural shocks\nThat flesh is heir to!  'Tis a consummation\nDevoutly to be wished.  To die! to sleep!\nTo sleep; perchance to dream!  O, there's the rub;\nFor in that sleep of death, what dreams may come\nWhen we have shuffled off this mortal coil,\nMust give us pause.  There's the respect\nThat makes calamity of so long life:\nFor who would bear the whips and scorns of time,\nThe oppressor's wrong, the poor man's contumely,\nThe pangs of despised love, the law's delay,\nThe insolence of office, and the spurns\nThat patient merit of the unworthy takes,\nWhen he himself might his quietus make\nWith a bare bodkin.  Who would fardels bear\nTo groan and sweat under a weary life,\nBut that the dread of something after death,\nThe undiscovered country, from whose bourn\nNo traveller returns, puzzles the will,\nAnd makes us rather bear those ills we have,\nThan fly to others that we know not of?\nThus conscience does make cowards of us all;\nAnd thus the native hue of resolution\nIs sicklied o'er with the pale cast of thought:\nAnd enterprises of great weight and moment\nWith this regard their currents turn awry,\nAnd lose the name of action--\"\nMy version of it runs thus:--\n\"Demeure, il faut choisir et passer a l'instant\nDe la vie, a la mort, ou de l'etre au neant.\nDieux cruels, s'il en est, eclairez mon courage.\nFaut-il vieillir courbe sous la main qui m'outrage,\nSupporter, ou finir mon malheur et mon sort?\nQui suis je?  Qui m'arrete! et qu'est-ce que la mort?\nC'est la fin de nos maux, c'est mon unique asile\nApres de longs transports, c'est un sommeil tranquile.\nOn s'endort, et tout meurt, mais un affreux reveil\nDoit succeder peut etre aux douceurs du sommeil!\nOn nous menace, on dit que cette courte vie,\nDe tourmens eternels est aussi-tot suivie.\nO mort! moment fatal! affreuse eternite!\nTout coeur a ton seul nom se glace epouvante.\nEh! qui pourroit sans toi supporter cette vie,\nDe nos pretres menteurs benir l'hypocrisie:\nD'une indigne maitresse encenser les erreurs,\nRamper sous un ministre, adorer ses hauteurs;\nEt montrer les langueurs de son ame abattue,\nA des amis ingrats qui detournent la vue?\nLa mort seroit trop douce en ces extremitez,\nMais le scrupule parle, et nous crie, arretez;\nIl defend a nos mains cet heureux homicide\nEt d'un heros guerrier, fait un Chretien timide,\" &c.\nDo not imagine that I have translated Shakspeare in a servile manner.  Woe\nto the writer who gives a literal version; who by rendering every word of\nhis original, by that very means enervates the sense, and extinguishes\nall the fire of it.  It is on such an occasion one may justly affirm,\nthat the letter kills, but the Spirit quickens.\nHere follows another passage copied from a celebrated tragic writer among\nthe English.  It is Dryden, a poet in the reign of Charles II.--a writer\nwhose genius was too exuberant, and not accompanied with judgment enough.\nHad he written only a tenth part of the works he left behind him, his\ncharacter would have been conspicuous in every part; but his great fault\nis his having endeavoured to be universal.\nThe passage in question is as follows:--\n\"When I consider life, 't is all a cheat,\nYet fooled by hope, men favour the deceit;\nTrust on and think, to-morrow will repay;\nTo-morrow's falser than the former day;\nLies more; and whilst it says we shall be blest\nWith some new joy, cuts off what we possessed;\nStrange cozenage! none would live past years again,\nYet all hope pleasure in what yet remain,\nAnd from the dregs of life think to receive\nWhat the first sprightly running could not give.\nI'm tired with waiting for this chymic gold,\nWhich fools us young, and beggars us when old.\"\nI shall now give you my translation:--\n\"De desseins en regrets et d'erreurs en desirs\nLes mortals insenses promenent leur folie.\nDans des malheurs presents, dans l'espoir des plaisirs\nNous ne vivons jamais, nous attendons la vie.\nDemain, demain, dit-on, va combler tous nos voeux.\nDemain vient, et nous laisse encore plus malheureux.\nQuelle est l'erreur, helas! du soin qui nous devore,\nNul de nous ne voudroit recommencer son cours.\nDe nos premiers momens nous maudissons l'aurore,\nEt de la nuit qui vient nous attendons encore,\nCe qu'ont en vain promis les plus beaux de nos jours,\" &c.\nIt is in these detached passages that the English have hitherto excelled.\nTheir dramatic pieces, most of which are barbarous and without decorum,\norder, or verisimilitude, dart such resplendent flashes through this\ngleam, as amaze and astonish.  The style is too much inflated, too\nunnatural, too closely copied from the Hebrew writers, who abound so much\nwith the Asiatic fustian.  But then it must be also confessed that the\nstilts of the figurative style, on which the English tongue is lifted up,\nraises the genius at the same time very far aloft, though with an\nirregular pace.  The first English writer who composed a regular tragedy,\nand infused a spirit of elegance through every part of it, was the\nillustrious Mr. Addison.  His \"Cato\" is a masterpiece, both with regard\nto the diction and to the beauty and harmony of the numbers.  The\ncharacter of Cato is, in my opinion, vastly superior to that of Cornelia\nin the \"Pompey\" of Corneille, for Cato is great without anything like\nfustian, and Cornelia, who besides is not a necessary character, tends\nsometimes to bombast.  Mr. Addison's Cato appears to me the greatest\ncharacter that was ever brought upon any stage, but then the rest of them\ndo not correspond to the dignity of it, and this dramatic piece, so\nexcellently well writ, is disfigured by a dull love plot, which spreads a\ncertain languor over the whole, that quite murders it.\nThe custom of introducing love at random and at any rate in the drama\npassed from Paris to London about 1660, with our ribbons and our\nperruques.  The ladies who adorn the theatrical circle there, in like\nmanner as in this city, will suffer love only to be the theme of every\nconversation.  The judicious Mr. Addison had the effeminate complaisance\nto soften the severity of his dramatic character, so as to adapt it to\nthe manners of the age, and, from an endeavour to please, quite ruined a\nmasterpiece in its kind.  Since his time the drama is become more\nregular, the audience more difficult to be pleased, and writers more\ncorrect and less bold.  I have seen some new pieces that were written\nwith great regularity, but which, at the same time, were very flat and\ninsipid.  One would think that the English had been hitherto formed to\nproduce irregular beauties only.  The shining monsters of Shakspeare give\ninfinite more delight than the judicious images of the moderns.  Hitherto\nthe poetical genius of the English resembles a tufted tree planted by the\nhand of Nature, that throws out a thousand branches at random, and\nspreads unequally, but with great vigour.  It dies if you attempt to\nforce its nature, and to lop and dress it in the same manner as the trees\nof the Garden of Marli.\nLETTER XIX.--ON COMEDY\nI am surprised that the judicious and ingenious Mr. de Muralt, who has\npublished some letters on the English and French nations, should have\nconfined himself; in treating of comedy, merely to censure Shadwell the\ncomic writer.  This author was had in pretty great contempt in Mr. de\nMuralt's time, and was not the poet of the polite part of the nation.  His\ndramatic pieces, which pleased some time in acting, were despised by all\npersons of taste, and might be compared to many plays which I have seen\nin France, that drew crowds to the playhouse, at the same time that they\nwere intolerable to read; and of which it might be said, that the whole\ncity of Paris exploded them, and yet all flocked to see them represented\non the stage.  Methinks Mr. de Muralt should have mentioned an excellent\ncomic writer (living when he was in England), I mean Mr. Wycherley, who\nwas a long time known publicly to be happy in the good graces of the most\ncelebrated mistress of King Charles II.  This gentleman, who passed his\nlife among persons of the highest distinction, was perfectly well\nacquainted with their lives and their follies, and painted them with the\nstrongest pencil, and in the truest colours.  He has drawn a misanthrope\nor man-hater, in imitation of that of Moliere.  All Wycherley's strokes\nare stronger and bolder than those of our misanthrope, but then they are\nless delicate, and the rules of decorum are not so well observed in this\nplay.  The English writer has corrected the only defect that is in\nMoliere's comedy, the thinness of the plot, which also is so disposed\nthat the characters in it do not enough raise our concern.  The English\ncomedy affects us, and the contrivance of the plot is very ingenious, but\nat the same time it is too bold for the French manners.  The fable is\nthis:--A captain of a man-of-war, who is very brave, open-hearted, and\ninflamed with a spirit of contempt for all mankind, has a prudent,\nsincere friend, whom he yet is suspicious of; and a mistress that loves\nhim with the utmost excess of passion.  The captain so far from returning\nher love, will not even condescend to look upon her, but confides\nentirely in a false friend, who is the most worthless wretch living.  At\nthe same time he has given his heart to a creature, who is the greatest\ncoquette and the most perfidious of her sex, and he is so credulous as to\nbe confident she is a Penelope, and his false friend a Cato.  He embarks\non board his ship in order to go and fight the Dutch, having left all his\nmoney, his jewels, and everything he had in the world to this virtuous\ncreature, whom at the same time he recommends to the care of his supposed\nfaithful friend.  Nevertheless the real man of honour, whom he suspects\nso unaccountably, goes on board the ship with him, and the mistress, on\nwhom he would not bestow so much as one glance, disguises herself in the\nhabit of a page, and is with him the whole voyage, without his once\nknowing that she is of a sex different from that she attempts to pass\nfor, which, by the way, is not over natural.\nThe captain having blown up his own ship in an engagement, returns to\nEngland abandoned and undone, accompanied by his page and his friend,\nwithout knowing the friendship of the one or the tender passion of the\nother.  Immediately he goes to the jewel among women, who he expected had\npreserved her fidelity to him and the treasure he had left in her hands.\nHe meets with her indeed, but married to the honest knave in whom he had\nreposed so much confidence, and finds she had acted as treacherously with\nregard to the casket he had entrusted her with.  The captain can scarce\nthink it possible that a woman of virtue and honour can act so vile a\npart; but to convince him still more of the reality of it, this very\nworthy lady falls in love with the little page, and will force him to her\nembraces.  But as it is requisite justice should be done, and that in a\ndramatic piece virtue ought to be rewarded and vice punished, it is at\nlast found that the captain takes his page's place, and lies with his\nfaithless mistress, cuckolds his treacherous friend, thrusts his sword\nthrough his body, recovers his casket, and marries his page.  You will\nobserve that this play is also larded with a petulant, litigious old\nwoman (a relation of the captain), who is the most comical character that\nwas ever brought upon the stage.\nWycherley has also copied from Moliere another play, of as singular and\nbold a cast, which is a kind of _Ecole des Femmes_, or, _School for\nMarried Women_.\nThe principal character in this comedy is one Homer, a sly fortune\nhunter, and the terror of all the City husbands.  This fellow, in order\nto play a surer game, causes a report to be spread, that in his last\nillness, the surgeons had found it necessary to have him made a eunuch.\nUpon his appearing in this noble character, all the husbands in town\nflock to him with their wives, and now poor Homer is only puzzled about\nhis choice.  However, he gives the preference particularly to a little\nfemale peasant, a very harmless, innocent creature, who enjoys a fine\nflush of health, and cuckolds her husband with a simplicity that has\ninfinitely more merit than the witty malice of the most experienced\nladies.  This play cannot indeed be called the school of good morals, but\nit is certainly the school of wit and true humour.\nSir John Vanbrugh has written several comedies, which are more humorous\nthan those of Mr. Wycherley, but not so ingenious.  Sir John was a man of\npleasure, and likewise a poet and an architect.  The general opinion is,\nthat he is as sprightly in his writings as he is heavy in his buildings.\nIt is he who raised the famous Castle of Blenheim, a ponderous and\nlasting monument of our unfortunate Battle of Hochstet.  Were the\napartments but as spacious as the walls are thick, this castle would be\ncommodious enough.  Some wag, in an epitaph he made on Sir John Vanbrugh,\nhas these lines:--\n\"Earth lie light on him, for he\nLaid many a heavy load on thee.\"\nSir John having taken a tour into France before the glorious war that\nbroke out in 1701, was thrown into the Bastille, and detained there for\nsome time, without being ever able to discover the motive which had\nprompted our ministry to indulge him with this mark of their distinction.\nHe wrote a comedy during his confinement; and a circumstance which\nappears to me very extraordinary is, that we don't meet with so much as a\nsingle satirical stroke against the country in which he had been so\ninjuriously treated.\nThe late Mr. Congreve raised the glory of comedy to a greater height than\nany English writer before or since his time.  He wrote only a few plays,\nbut they are all excellent in their kind.  The laws of the drama are\nstrictly observed in them; they abound with characters all which are\nshadowed with the utmost delicacy, and we don't meet with so much as one\nlow or coarse jest.  The language is everywhere that of men of honour,\nbut their actions are those of knaves--a proof that he was perfectly well\nacquainted with human nature, and frequented what we call polite company.\nHe was infirm and come to the verge of life when I knew him.  Mr.\nCongreve had one defect, which was his entertaining too mean an idea of\nhis first profession (that of a writer), though it was to this he owed\nhis fame and fortune.  He spoke of his works as of trifles that were\nbeneath him; and hinted to me, in our first conversation, that I should\nvisit him upon no other footing than that of a gentleman who led a life\nof plainness and simplicity.  I answered, that had he been so unfortunate\nas to be a mere gentleman, I should never have come to see him; and I was\nvery much disgusted at so unseasonable a piece of vanity.\nMr. Congreve's comedies are the most witty and regular, those of Sir John\nVanbrugh most gay and humorous, and those of Mr. Wycherley have the\ngreatest force and spirit.  It may be proper to observe that these fine\ngeniuses never spoke disadvantageously of Moliere; and that none but the\ncontemptible writers among the English have endeavoured to lessen the\ncharacter of that great comic poet.  Such Italian musicians as despise\nLully are themselves persons of no character or ability; but a Buononcini\nesteems that great artist, and does justice to his merit.\nThe English have some other good comic writers living, such as Sir\nRichard Steele and Mr. Cibber, who is an excellent player, and also Poet\nLaureate--a title which, how ridiculous soever it may be thought, is yet\nworth a thousand crowns a year (besides some considerable privileges) to\nthe person who enjoys it.  Our illustrious Corneille had not so much.\nTo conclude.  Don't desire me to descend to particulars with regard to\nthese English comedies, which I am so fond of applauding; nor to give you\na single smart saying or humorous stroke from Wycherley or Congreve.  We\ndon't laugh in rending a translation.  If you have a mind to understand\nthe English comedy, the only way to do this will be for you to go to\nEngland, to spend three years in London, to make yourself master of the\nEnglish tongue, and to frequent the playhouse every night.  I receive but\nlittle pleasure from the perusal of Aristophanes and Plautus, and for\nthis reason, because I am neither a Greek nor a Roman.  The delicacy of\nthe humour, the allusion, the _a propos_--all these are lost to a\nforeigner.\nBut it is different with respect to tragedy, this treating only of\nexalted passions and heroical follies, which the antiquated errors of\nfable or history have made sacred.  OEdipus, Electra, and such-like\ncharacters, may with as much propriety be treated of by the Spaniards,\nthe English, or us, as by the Greeks.  But true comedy is the speaking\npicture of the follies and ridiculous foibles of a nation; so that he\nonly is able to judge of the painting who is perfectly acquainted with\nthe people it represents.\nLETTER XX.--ON SUCH OF THE NOBILITY AS CULTIVATE THE BELLES LETTRES\nThere once was a time in France when the polite arts were cultivated by\npersons of the highest rank in the state.  The courtiers particularly\nwere conversant in them, although indolence, a taste for trifles, and a\npassion for intrigue, were the divinities of the country.  The Court\nmethinks at this time seems to have given into a taste quite opposite to\nthat of polite literature, but perhaps the mode of thinking may be\nrevived in a little time.  The French are of so flexible a disposition,\nmay be moulded into such a variety of shapes, that the monarch needs but\ncommand and he is immediately obeyed.  The English generally think, and\nlearning is had in greater honour among them than in our country--an\nadvantage that results naturally from the form of their government.  There\nare about eight hundred persons in England who have a right to speak in\npublic, and to support the interest of the kingdom; and near five or six\nthousand may in their turns aspire to the same honour.  The whole nation\nset themselves up as judges over these, and every man has the liberty of\npublishing his thoughts with regard to public affairs, which shows that\nall the people in general are indispensably obliged to cultivate their\nunderstandings.  In England the governments of Greece and Rome are the\nsubject of every conversation, so that every man is under a necessity of\nperusing such authors as treat of them, how disagreeable soever it may be\nto him; and this study leads naturally to that of polite literature.\nMankind in general speak well in their respective professions.  What is\nthe reason why our magistrates, our lawyers, our physicians, and a great\nnumber of the clergy, are abler scholars, have a finer taste, and more\nwit, than persons of all other professions?  The reason is, because their\ncondition of life requires a cultivated and enlightened mind, in the same\nmanner as a merchant is obliged to be acquainted with his traffic.  Not\nlong since an English nobleman, who was very young, came to see me at\nParis on his return from Italy.  He had written a poetical description of\nthat country, which, for delicacy and politeness, may vie with anything\nwe meet with in the Earl of Rochester, or in our Chaulieu, our Sarrasin,\nor Chapelle.  The translation I have given of it is so inexpressive of\nthe strength and delicate humour of the original, that I am obliged\nseriously to ask pardon of the author and of all who understand English.\nHowever, as this is the only method I have to make his lordship's verses\nknown, I shall here present you with them in our tongue:--\n\"Qu'ay je donc vu dans l'Italie?\nOrgueil, astuce, et pauvrete,\nGrands complimens, peu de bonte\nEt beaucoup de ceremonie.\n\"L'extravagante comedie\nQue souvent l'Inquisition\nVent qu'on nomme religion\nMais qu'ici nous nommons folie.\n\"La Nature en vain bienfaisante\nVent enricher ses lieux charmans,\nDes pretres la main desolante\nEtouffe ses plus beaux presens.\n\"Les monsignors, soy disant Grands,\nSeuls dans leurs palais magnifiques\nY sont d'illustres faineants,\nSans argent, et sans domestiques.\n\"Pour les petits, sans liberte,\nMartyrs du joug qui les domine,\nIls ont fait voeu de pauvrete,\nPriant Dieu par oisivete\nEt toujours jeunant par famine.\n\"Ces beaux lieux du Pape benis\nSemblent habitez par les diables;\nEt les habitans miserables\nSont damnes dans le Paradis.\"\nLETTER XXI.--ON THE EARL OF ROCHESTER AND MR. WALLER\nThe Earl of Rochester's name is universally known.  Mr. de St. Evremont\nhas made very frequent mention of him, but then he has represented this\nfamous nobleman in no other light than as the man of pleasure, as one who\nwas the idol of the fair; but, with regard to myself, I would willingly\ndescribe in him the man of genius, the great poet.  Among other pieces\nwhich display the shining imagination, his lordship only could boast he\nwrote some satires on the same subjects as those our celebrated Boileau\nmade choice of.  I do not know any better method of improving the taste\nthan to compare the productions of such great geniuses as have exercised\ntheir talent on the same subject.  Boileau declaims as follows against\nhuman reason in his \"Satire on Man:\"\n\"Cependant a le voir plein de vapeurs legeres,\nSoi-meme se bercer de ses propres chimeres,\nLui seul de la nature est la baze et l'appui,\nEt le dixieme ciel ne tourne que pour lui.\nDe tous les animaux il est ici le maitre;\nQui pourroit le nier, poursuis tu?  Moi peut-etre.\nCe maitre pretendu qui leur donne des loix,\nCe roi des animaux, combien a-t'il de rois?\"\n\"Yet, pleased with idle whimsies of his brain,\nAnd puffed with pride, this haughty thing would fain\nBe think himself the only stay and prop\nThat holds the mighty frame of Nature up.\nThe skies and stars his properties must seem,\n* * *\nOf all the creatures he's the lord, he cries.\n* * *\nAnd who is there, say you, that dares deny\nSo owned a truth?  That may be, sir, do I.\n* * *\nThis boasted monarch of the world who awes\nThe creatures here, and with his nod gives laws\nThis self-named king, who thus pretends to be\nThe lord of all, how many lords has he?\"\nOLDHAM, _a little altered_.\nThe Lord Rochester expresses himself, in his \"Satire against Man,\" in\npretty near the following manner.  But I must first desire you always to\nremember that the versions I give you from the English poets are written\nwith freedom and latitude, and that the restraint of our versification,\nand the delicacies of the French tongue, will not allow a translator to\nconvey into it the licentious impetuosity and fire of the English\nnumbers:--\n\"Cet esprit que je hais, cet esprit plein d'erreur,\nCe n'est pas ma raison, c'est la tienne, docteur.\nC'est la raison frivole, inquiete, orgueilleuse\nDes sages animaux, rivale dedaigneuse,\nQui croit entr'eux et l'Ange, occuper le milieu,\nEt pense etre ici bas l'image de son Dieu.\nVil atome imparfait, qui croit, doute, dispute\nRampe, s'eleve, tombe, et nie encore sa chute,\nQui nous dit je suis libre, en nous montrant ses fers,\nEt dont l'oeil trouble et faux, croit percer l'univers.\nAllez, reverends fous, bienheureux fanatiques,\nCompilez bien l'amas de vos riens scholastiques,\nPeres de visions, et d'enigmes sacres,\nAuteurs du labirinthe, ou vous vous egarez.\nAllez obscurement eclaircir vos misteres,\nEt courez dans l'ecole adorer vos chimeres.\nIl est d'autres erreurs, il est de ces devots\nCondamne par eux memes a l'ennui du repos.\nCe mystique encloitre, fier de son indolence\nTranquille, au sein de Dieu.  Que peut il faire?  Il pense.\nNon, tu ne penses point, miserable, tu dors:\nInutile a la terre, et mis au rang des morts.\nTon esprit enerve croupit dans la molesse.\nReveille toi, sois homme, et sors de ton ivresse.\nL'homme est ne pour agir, et tu pretens penser?\"  &c.\nThe original runs thus:--\n\"Hold mighty man, I cry all this we know,\nAnd 'tis this very reason I despise,\nThis supernatural gift that makes a mite\nThink he's the image of the Infinite;\nComparing his short life, void of all rest,\nTo the eternal and the ever blest.\nThis busy, puzzling stirrer up of doubt,\nThat frames deep mysteries, then finds them out,\nFilling, with frantic crowds of thinking fools,\nThose reverend bedlams, colleges, and schools;\nBorne on whose wings each heavy sot can pierce\nThe limits of the boundless universe.\nSo charming ointments make an old witch fly,\nAnd bear a crippled carcase through the sky.\n'Tis this exalted power, whose business lies\nIn nonsense and impossibilities.\nThis made a whimsical philosopher\nBefore the spacious world his tub prefer;\nAnd we have modern cloistered coxcombs, who\nRetire to think, 'cause they have naught to do.\nBut thoughts are given for action's government,\nWhere action ceases, thought's impertinent.\"\nWhether these ideas are true or false, it is certain they are expressed\nwith an energy and fire which form the poet.  I shall be very far from\nattempting to examine philosophically into these verses, to lay down the\npencil, and take up the rule and compass on this occasion; my only design\nin this letter being to display the genius of the English poets, and\ntherefore I shall continue in the same view.\nThe celebrated Mr. Waller has been very much talked of in France, and Mr.\nDe la Fontaine, St. Evremont, and Bayle have written his eulogium, but\nstill his name only is known.  He had much the same reputation in London\nas Voiture had in Paris, and in my opinion deserved it better.  Voiture\nwas born in an age that was just emerging from barbarity; an age that was\nstill rude and ignorant, the people of which aimed at wit, though they\nhad not the least pretensions to it, and sought for points and conceits\ninstead of sentiments.  Bristol stones are more easily found than\ndiamonds.  Voiture, born with an easy and frivolous, genius, was the\nfirst who shone in this aurora of French literature.  Had he come into\nthe world after those great geniuses who spread such a glory over the age\nof Louis XIV., he would either have been unknown, would have been\ndespised, or would have corrected his style.  Boileau applauded him, but\nit was in his first satires, at a time when the taste of that great poet\nwas not yet formed.  He was young, and in an age when persons form a\njudgment of men from their reputation, and not from their writings.\nBesides, Boileau was very partial both in his encomiums and his censures.\nHe applauded Segrais, whose works nobody reads; he abused Quinault, whose\npoetical pieces every one has got by heart; and is wholly silent upon La\nFontaine.  Waller, though a better poet than Voiture, was not yet a\nfinished poet.  The graces breathe in such of Waller's works as are writ\nin a tender strain; but then they are languid through negligence, and\noften disfigured with false thoughts.  The English had not in his time\nattained the art of correct writing.  But his serious compositions\nexhibit a strength and vigour which could not have been expected from the\nsoftness and effeminacy of his other pieces.  He wrote an elegy on Oliver\nCromwell, which, with all its faults, is nevertheless looked upon as a\nmasterpiece.  To understand this copy of verses you are to know that the\nday Oliver died was remarkable for a great storm.  His poem begins in\nthis manner:--\n\"Il n'est plus, s'en est fait, soumettons nous au sort,\nLe ciel a signale ce jour par des tempetes,\nEt la voix des tonnerres eclatant sur nos tetes\nVient d'annoncer sa mort.\n\"Par ses derniers soupirs il ebranle cet ile;\nCet ile que son bras fit trembler tant de fois,\nQuand dans le cours de ses exploits,\nIl brisoit la tete des Rois,\nEt soumettoit un peuple a son joug seul docile.\n\"Mer tu t'en es trouble; O mer tes flots emus\nSemblent dire en grondant aux plus lointains rivages\nQue l'effroi de la terre et ton maitre n'est plus.\n\"Tel au ciel autrefois s'envola Romulus,\nTel il quitta la Terre, au milieu des orages,\nTel d'un peuple guerrier il recut les homages;\nObei dans sa vie, sa mort adore,\nSon palais fut un Temple,\" &c.\n* * * * *\n\"We must resign! heaven his great soul does claim\nIn storms as loud as his immortal fame;\nHis dying groans, his last breath shakes our isle,\nAnd trees uncut fall for his funeral pile:\nAbout his palace their broad roots are tost\nInto the air; so Romulus was lost!\nNew Rome in such a tempest missed her king,\nAnd from obeying fell to worshipping.\nOn OEta's top thus Hercules lay dead,\nWith ruined oaks and pines about him spread.\nNature herself took notice of his death,\nAnd, sighing, swelled the sea with such a breath,\nThat to remotest shores the billows rolled,\nTh' approaching fate of his great ruler told.\"\nWALLER.\nIt was this elogium that gave occasion to the reply (taken notice of in\nBayle's Dictionary), which Waller made to King Charles II.  This king, to\nwhom Waller had a little before (as is usual with bards and monarchs)\npresented a copy of verses embroidered with praises, reproached the poet\nfor not writing with so much energy and fire as when he had applauded the\nUsurper (meaning Oliver).  \"Sir,\" replied Waller to the king, \"we poets\nsucceed better in fiction than in truth.\"  This answer was not so sincere\nas that which a Dutch ambassador made, who, when the same monarch\ncomplained that his masters paid less regard to him than they had done to\nCromwell.  \"Ah, sir!\" says the Ambassador, \"Oliver was quite another\nman--\"  It is not my intent to give a commentary on Waller's character,\nnor on that of any other person; for I consider men after their death in\nno other light than as they were writers, and wholly disregard everything\nelse.  I shall only observe that Waller, though born in a court, and to\nan estate of five or six thousand pounds sterling a year, was never so\nproud or so indolent as to lay aside the happy talent which Nature had\nindulged him.  The Earls of Dorset and Roscommon, the two Dukes of\nBuckingham, the Lord Halifax, and so many other noblemen, did not think\nthe reputation they obtained of very great poets and illustrious writers,\nany way derogatory to their quality.  They are more glorious for their\nworks than for their titles.  These cultivated the polite arts with as\nmuch assiduity as though they had been their whole dependence.\nThey also have made learning appear venerable in the eyes of the vulgar,\nwho have need to be led in all things by the great; and who,\nnevertheless, fashion their manners less after those of the nobility (in\nEngland I mean) than in any other country in the world.\nLETTER XXII.--ON MR. POPE AND SOME OTHER FAMOUS POETS\nI intended to treat of Mr. Prior, one of the most amiable English poets,\nwhom you saw Plenipotentiary and Envoy Extraordinary at Paris in 1712.  I\nalso designed to have given you some idea of the Lord Roscommon's and the\nLord Dorset's muse; but I find that to do this I should be obliged to\nwrite a large volume, and that, after much pains and trouble, you would\nhave but an imperfect idea of all those works.  Poetry is a kind of music\nin which a man should have some knowledge before he pretends to judge of\nit.  When I give you a translation of some passages from those foreign\npoets, I only prick down, and that imperfectly, their music; but then I\ncannot express the taste of their harmony.\nThere is one English poem especially which I should despair of ever\nmaking you understand, the title whereof is \"Hudibras.\"  The subject of\nit is the Civil War in the time of the grand rebellion, and the\nprinciples and practice of the Puritans are therein ridiculed.  It is Don\nQuixote, it is our \"Satire Menippee\" blended together.  I never found so\nmuch wit in one single book as in that, which at the same time is the\nmost difficult to be translated.  Who would believe that a work which\npaints in such lively and natural colours the several foibles and follies\nof mankind, and where we meet with more sentiments than words, should\nbaffle the endeavours of the ablest translator?  But the reason of this\nis, almost every part of it alludes to particular incidents.  The clergy\nare there made the principal object of ridicule, which is understood but\nby few among the laity.  To explain this a commentary would be requisite,\nand humour when explained is no longer humour.  Whoever sets up for a\ncommentator of smart sayings and repartees is himself a blockhead.  This\nis the reason why the works of the ingenious Dean Swift, who has been\ncalled the English Rabelais, will never be well understood in France.\nThis gentleman has the honour (in common with Rabelais) of being a\npriest, and, like him, laughs at everything; but, in my humble opinion,\nthe title of the English Rabelais which is given the dean is highly\nderogatory to his genius.  The former has interspersed his unaccountably-\nfantastic and unintelligible book with the most gay strokes of humour;\nbut which, at the same time, has a greater proportion of impertinence.  He\nhas been vastly lavish of erudition, of smut, and insipid raillery.  An\nagreeable tale of two pages is purchased at the expense of whole volumes\nof nonsense.  There are but few persons, and those of a grotesque taste,\nwho pretend to understand and to esteem this work; for, as to the rest of\nthe nation, they laugh at the pleasant and diverting touches which are\nfound in Rabelais and despise his book.  He is looked upon as the prince\nof buffoons.  The readers are vexed to think that a man who was master of\nso much wit should have made so wretched a use of it; he is an\nintoxicated philosopher who never wrote but when he was in liquor.\nDean Swift is Rabelais in his senses, and frequenting the politest\ncompany.  The former, indeed, is not so gay as the latter, but then he\npossesses all the delicacy, the justness, the choice, the good taste, in\nall which particulars our giggling rural Vicar Rabelais is wanting.  The\npoetical numbers of Dean Swift are of a singular and almost inimitable\ntaste; true humour, whether in prose or verse, seems to be his peculiar\ntalent; but whoever is desirous of understanding him perfectly must visit\nthe island in which he was born.\nIt will be much easier for you to form an idea of Mr. Pope's works.  He\nis, in my opinion, the most elegant, the most correct poet; and, at the\nsame time, the most harmonious (a circumstance which redounds very much\nto the honour of this muse) that England ever gave birth to.  He has\nmellowed the harsh sounds of the English trumpet to the soft accents of\nthe flute.  His compositions may be easily translated, because they are\nvastly clear and perspicuous; besides, most of his subjects are general,\nand relative to all nations.\nHis \"Essay on Criticism\" will soon be known in France by the translation\nwhich l'Abbe de Resnel has made of it.\nHere is an extract from his poem entitled the \"Rape of the Lock,\" which I\njust now translated with the latitude I usually take on these occasions;\nfor, once again, nothing can be more ridiculous than to translate a poet\nliterally:--\n\"Umbriel, a l'instant, vieil gnome rechigne,\nVa d'une aile pesante et d'un air renfrogne\nChercher en murmurant la caverne profonde,\nOu loin des doux raions que repand l'oeil du monde\nLa Deesse aux Vapeurs a choisi son sejour,\nLes Tristes Aquilons y sifflent a l'entour,\nEt le souffle mal sain de leur aride haleine\nY porte aux environs la fievre et la migraine.\nSur un riche sofa derriere un paravent\nLoin des flambeaux, du bruit, des parleurs et du vent,\nLa quinteuse deesse incessamment repose,\nLe coeur gros de chagrin, sans en savoir la cause.\nN'aiant pense jamais, l'esprit toujours trouble,\nL'oeil charge, le teint pale, et l'hypocondre enfle.\nLa medisante Envie, est assise aupres d'elle,\nVieil spectre feminin, decrepite pucelle,\nAvec un air devot dechirant son prochain,\nEt chansonnant les Gens l'Evangile a la main.\nSur un lit plein de fleurs negligemment panchee\nUne jeune beaute non loin d'elle est couchee,\nC'est l'Affectation qui grassaie en parlant,\nEcoute sans entendre, et lorgne en regardant.\nQui rougit sans pudeur, et rit de tout sans joie,\nDe cent maux differens pretend qu'elle est la proie;\nEt pleine de sante sous le rouge et le fard,\nSe plaint avec molesse, et se pame avec art.\"\n\"Umbriel, a dusky, melancholy sprite\nAs ever sullied the fair face of light,\nDown to the central earth, his proper scene,\nRepairs to search the gloomy cave of Spleen.\nSwift on his sooty pinions flits the gnome,\nAnd in a vapour reached the dismal dome.\nNo cheerful breeze this sullen region knows,\nThe dreaded east is all the wind that blows.\nHere, in a grotto, sheltered close from air,\nAnd screened in shades from day's detested glare,\nShe sighs for ever on her pensive bed,\nPain at her side, and Megrim at her head,\nTwo handmaids wait the throne.  Alike in place,\nBut differing far in figure and in face,\nHere stood Ill-nature, like an ancient maid,\nHer wrinkled form in black and white arrayed;\nWith store of prayers for mornings, nights, and noons,\nHer hand is filled; her bosom with lampoons.\nThere Affectation, with a sickly mien,\nShows in her cheek the roses of eighteen,\nPractised to lisp, and hang the head aside,\nFaints into airs, and languishes with pride;\nOn the rich quilt sinks with becoming woe,\nWrapt in a gown, for sickness and for show.\"\nThis extract, in the original (not in the faint translation I have given\nyou of it), may be compared to the description of _la Molesse_ (softness\nor effeminacy), in Boileau's \"Lutrin.\"\nMethinks I now have given you specimens enough from the English poets.  I\nhave made some transient mention of their philosophers, but as for good\nhistorians among them, I don't know of any; and, indeed, a Frenchman was\nforced to write their history.  Possibly the English genius, which is\neither languid or impetuous, has not yet acquired that unaffected\neloquence, that plain but majestic air which history requires.  Possibly\ntoo, the spirit of party which exhibits objects in a dim and confused\nlight may have sunk the credit of their historians.  One half of the\nnation is always at variance with the other half.  I have met with people\nwho assured me that the Duke of Marlborough was a coward, and that Mr.\nPope was a fool; just as some Jesuits in France declare Pascal to have\nbeen a man of little or no genius, and some Jansenists affirm Father\nBourdaloue to have been a mere babbler.  The Jacobites consider Mary\nQueen of Scots as a pious heroine, but those of an opposite party look\nupon her as a prostitute, an adulteress, a murderer.  Thus the English\nhave memorials of the several reigns, but no such thing as a history.\nThere is, indeed, now living, one Mr. Gordon (the public are obliged to\nhim for a translation of Tacitus), who is very capable of writing the\nhistory of his own country, but Rapin de Thoyras got the start of him.  To\nconclude, in my opinion the English have not such good historians as the\nFrench have no such thing as a real tragedy, have several delightful\ncomedies, some wonderful passages in certain of their poems, and boast of\nphilosophers that are worthy of instructing mankind.  The English have\nreaped very great benefit from the writers of our nation, and therefore\nwe ought (since they have not scrupled to be in our debt) to borrow from\nthem.  Both the English and we came after the Italians, who have been our\ninstructors in all the arts, and whom we have surpassed in some.  I\ncannot determine which of the three nations ought to be honoured with the\npalm; but happy the writer who could display their various merits.\nLETTER XXIII.--ON THE REGARD THAT OUGHT TO BE SHOWN TO MEN OF LETTERS\nNeither the English nor any other people have foundations established in\nfavour of the polite arts like those in France.  There are Universities\nin most countries, but it is in France only that we meet with so\nbeneficial an encouragement for astronomy and all parts of the\nmathematics, for physic, for researches into antiquity, for painting,\nsculpture, and architecture.  Louis XIV. has immortalised his name by\nthese several foundations, and this immortality did not cost him two\nhundred thousand livres a year.\nI must confess that one of the things I very much wonder at is, that as\nthe Parliament of Great Britain have promised a reward of 20,000 pounds\nsterling to any person who may discover the longitude, they should never\nhave once thought to imitate Louis XIV. in his munificence with regard to\nthe arts and sciences.\nMerit, indeed, meets in England with rewards of another kind, which\nredound more to the honour of the nation.  The English have so great a\nveneration for exalted talents, that a man of merit in their country is\nalways sure of making his fortune.  Mr. Addison in France would have been\nelected a member of one of the academies, and, by the credit of some\nwomen, might have obtained a yearly pension of twelve hundred livres, or\nelse might have been imprisoned in the Bastile, upon pretence that\ncertain strokes in his tragedy of _Cato_ had been discovered which\nglanced at the porter of some man in power.  Mr. Addison was raised to\nthe post of Secretary of State in England.  Sir Isaac Newton was made\nMaster of the Royal Mint.  Mr. Congreve had a considerable employment.\nMr. Prior was Plenipotentiary.  Dr. Swift is Dean of St. Patrick in\nDublin, and is more revered in Ireland than the Primate himself.  The\nreligion which Mr. Pope professes excludes him, indeed, from preferments\nof every kind, but then it did not prevent his gaining two hundred\nthousand livres by his excellent translation of Homer.  I myself saw a\nlong time in France the author of _Rhadamistus_ ready to perish for\nhunger.  And the son of one of the greatest men our country ever gave\nbirth to, and who was beginning to run the noble career which his father\nhad set him, would have been reduced to the extremes of misery had he not\nbeen patronised by Monsieur Fagon.\nBut the circumstance which mostly encourages the arts in England is the\ngreat veneration which is paid them.  The picture of the Prime Minister\nhangs over the chimney of his own closet, but I have seen that of Mr.\nPope in twenty noblemen's houses.  Sir Isaac Newton was revered in his\nlifetime, and had a due respect paid to him after his death; the greatest\nmen in the nation disputing who should have the honour of holding up his\npall.  Go into Westminster Abbey, and you will find that what raises the\nadmiration of the spectator is not the mausoleums of the English kings,\nbut the monuments which the gratitude of the nation has erected to\nperpetuate the memory of those illustrious men who contributed to its\nglory.  We view their statues in that abbey in the same manner as those\nof Sophocles, Plato, and other immortal personages were viewed in Athens;\nand I am persuaded that the bare sight of those glorious monuments has\nfired more than one breast, and been the occasion of their becoming great\nmen.\nThe English have even been reproached with paying too extravagant honours\nto mere merit, and censured for interring the celebrated actress Mrs.\nOldfield in Westminster Abbey, with almost the same pomp as Sir Isaac\nNewton.  Some pretend that the English had paid her these great funeral\nhonours, purposely to make us more strongly sensible of the barbarity and\ninjustice which they object to us, for having buried Mademoiselle Le\nCouvreur ignominiously in the fields.\nBut be assured from me, that the English were prompted by no other\nprinciple in burying Mrs. Oldfield in Westminster Abbey than their good\nsense.  They are far from being so ridiculous as to brand with infamy an\nart which has immortalised a Euripides and a Sophocles; or to exclude\nfrom the body of their citizens a set of people whose business is to set\noff with the utmost grace of speech and action those pieces which the\nnation is proud of.\nUnder the reign of Charles I. and in the beginning of the civil wars\nraised by a number of rigid fanatics, who at last were the victims to it;\na great many pieces were published against theatrical and other shows,\nwhich were attacked with the greater virulence because that monarch and\nhis queen, daughter to Henry I. of France, were passionately fond of\nthem.\nOne Mr. Prynne, a man of most furiously scrupulous principles, who would\nhave thought himself damned had he worn a cassock instead of a short\ncloak, and have been glad to see one-half of mankind cut the other to\npieces for the glory of God, and the _Propaganda Fide_; took it into his\nhead to write a most wretched satire against some pretty good comedies,\nwhich were exhibited very innocently every night before their majesties.\nHe quoted the authority of the Rabbis, and some passages from St.\nBonaventure, to prove that the OEdipus of Sophocles was the work of the\nevil spirit; that Terence was excommunicated _ipso facto_; and added,\nthat doubtless Brutus, who was a very severe Jansenist, assassinated\nJulius Caesar for no other reason but because he, who was Pontifex\nMaximus, presumed to write a tragedy the subject of which was OEdipus.\nLastly, he declared that all who frequented the theatre were\nexcommunicated, as they thereby renounced their baptism.  This was\ncasting the highest insult on the king and all the royal family; and as\nthe English loved their prince at that time, they could not bear to hear\na writer talk of excommunicating him, though they themselves afterwards\ncut his head off.  Prynne was summoned to appear before the Star Chamber;\nhis wonderful book, from which Father Le Brun stole his, was sentenced to\nbe burnt by the common hangman, and himself to lose his ears.  His trial\nis now extant.\nThe Italians are far from attempting to cast a blemish on the opera, or\nto excommunicate Signor Senesino or Signora Cuzzoni.  With regard to\nmyself, I could presume to wish that the magistrates would suppress I\nknow not what contemptible pieces written against the stage.  For when\nthe English and Italians hear that we brand with the greatest mark of\ninfamy an art in which we excel; that we excommunicate persons who\nreceive salaries from the king; that we condemn as impious a spectacle\nexhibited in convents and monasteries; that we dishonour sports in which\nLouis XIV. and Louis XV., performed as actors; that we give the title of\nthe devil's works to pieces which are received by magistrates of the most\nsevere character, and represented before a virtuous queen; when, I say,\nforeigners are told of this insolent conduct, this contempt for the royal\nauthority, and this Gothic rusticity which some presume to call Christian\nseverity, what an idea must they entertain of our nation?  And how will\nit be possible for them to conceive, either that our laws give a sanction\nto an art which is declared infamous, or that some persons dare to stamp\nwith infamy an art which receives a sanction from the laws, is rewarded\nby kings, cultivated and encouraged by the greatest men, and admired by\nwhole nations?  And that Father Le Brun's impertinent libel against the\nstage is seen in a bookseller's shop, standing the very next to the\nimmortal labours of Racine, of Corneille, of Moliere, &c.\nLETTER XXIV.--ON THE ROYAL SOCIETY AND OTHER ACADEMIES\nThe English had an Academy of Sciences many years before us, but then it\nis not under such prudent regulations as ours, the only reason of which\nvery possibly is, because it was founded before the Academy of Paris; for\nhad it been founded after, it would very probably have adopted some of\nthe sage laws of the former and improved upon others.\nTwo things, and those the most essential to man, are wanting in the Royal\nSociety of London, I mean rewards and laws.  A seat in the Academy at\nParis is a small but secure fortune to a geometrician or a chemist; but\nthis is so far from being the case at London, that the several members of\nthe Royal Society are at a continual, though indeed small expense.  Any\nman in England who declares himself a lover of the mathematics and\nnatural philosophy, and expresses an inclination to be a member of the\nRoyal Society, is immediately elected into it.  But in France it is not\nenough that a man who aspires to the honour of being a member of the\nAcademy, and of receiving the royal stipend, has a love for the sciences;\nhe must at the same time be deeply skilled in them; and is obliged to\ndispute the seat with competitors who are so much the more formidable as\nthey are fired by a principle of glory, by interest, by the difficulty\nitself; and by that inflexibility of mind which is generally found in\nthose who devote themselves to that pertinacious study, the mathematics.\nThe Academy of Sciences is prudently confined to the study of Nature,\nand, indeed, this is a field spacious enough for fifty or threescore\npersons to range in.  That of London mixes indiscriminately literature\nwith physics; but methinks the founding an academy merely for the polite\narts is more judicious, as it prevents confusion, and the joining, in\nsome measure, of heterogeneals, such as a dissertation on the\nhead-dresses of the Roman ladies with a hundred or more new curves.\nAs there is very little order and regularity in the Royal Society, and\nnot the least encouragement; and that the Academy of Paris is on a quite\ndifferent foot, it is no wonder that our transactions are drawn up in a\nmore just and beautiful manner than those of the English.  Soldiers who\nare under a regular discipline, and besides well paid, must necessarily\nat last perform more glorious achievements than others who are mere\nvolunteers.  It must indeed be confessed that the Royal Society boast\ntheir Newton, but then he did not owe his knowledge and discoveries to\nthat body; so far from it, that the latter were intelligible to very few\nof his fellow members.  A genius like that of Sir Isaac belonged to all\nthe academies in the world, because all had a thousand things to learn of\nhim.\nThe celebrated Dean Swift formed a design, in the latter end of the late\nQueen's reign, to found an academy for the English tongue upon the model\nof that of the French.  This project was promoted by the late Earl of\nOxford, Lord High Treasurer, and much more by the Lord Bolingbroke,\nSecretary of State, who had the happy talent of speaking without\npremeditation in the Parliament House with as much purity as Dean Swift\nwrote in his closet, and who would have been the ornament and protector\nof that academy.  Those only would have been chosen members of it whose\nworks will last as long as the English tongue, such as Dean Swift, Mr.\nPrior, whom we saw here invested with a public character, and whose fame\nin England is equal to that of La Fontaine in France; Mr. Pope, the\nEnglish Boileau, Mr. Congreve, who may be called their Moliere, and\nseveral other eminent persons whose names I have forgot; all these would\nhave raised the glory of that body to a great height even in its infancy.\nBut Queen Anne being snatched suddenly from the world, the Whigs were\nresolved to ruin the protectors of the intended academy, a circumstance\nthat was of the most fatal consequence to polite literature.  The members\nof this academy would have had a very great advantage over those who\nfirst formed that of the French, for Swift, Prior, Congreve, Dryden,\nPope, Addison, &c. had fixed the English tongue by their writings;\nwhereas Chapelain, Colletet, Cassaigne, Faret, Perrin, Cotin, our first\nacademicians, were a disgrace to their country; and so much ridicule is\nnow attached to their very names, that if an author of some genius in\nthis age had the misfortune to be called Chapelain or Cotin, he would be\nunder a necessity of changing his name.\nOne circumstance, to which the English Academy should especially have\nattended, is to have prescribed to themselves occupations of a quite\ndifferent kind from those with which our academicians amuse themselves.  A\nwit of this country asked me for the memoirs of the French Academy.  I\nanswered, they have no memoirs, but have printed threescore or fourscore\nvolumes in quarto of compliments.  The gentleman perused one or two of\nthem, but without being able to understand the style in which they were\nwritten, though he understood all our good authors perfectly.  \"All,\"\nsays he, \"I see in these elegant discourses is, that the member elect\nhaving assured the audience that his predecessor was a great man, that\nCardinal Richelieu was a very great man, that the Chancellor Seguier was\na pretty great man, that Louis XIV. was a more than great man, the\ndirector answers in the very same strain, and adds, that the member elect\nmay also be a sort of great man, and that himself, in quality of\ndirector, must also have some share in this greatness.\"\nThe cause why all these academical discourses have unhappily done so\nlittle honour to this body is evident enough.  _Vitium est temporis\npotius quam hominis_ (the fault is owing to the age rather than to\nparticular persons).  It grew up insensibly into a custom for every\nacademician to repeat these elogiums at his reception; it was laid down\nas a kind of law that the public should be indulged from time to time the\nsullen satisfaction of yawning over these productions.  If the reason\nshould afterwards be sought, why the greatest geniuses who have been\nincorporated into that body have sometimes made the worst speeches, I\nanswer, that it is wholly owing to a strong propension, the gentlemen in\nquestion had to shine, and to display a thread-bare, worn-out subject in\na new and uncommon light.  The necessity of saying something, the\nperplexity of having nothing to say, and a desire of being witty, are\nthree circumstances which alone are capable of making even the greatest\nwriter ridiculous.  These gentlemen, not being able to strike out any new\nthoughts, hunted after a new play of words, and delivered themselves\nwithout thinking at all: in like manner as people who should seem to chew\nwith great eagerness, and make as though they were eating, at the same\ntime that they were just starved.\nIt is a law in the French Academy, to publish all those discourses by\nwhich only they are known, but they should rather make a law never to\nprint any of them.\nBut the Academy of the _Belles Lettres_ have a more prudent and more\nuseful object, which is, to present the public with a collection of\ntransactions that abound with curious researches and critiques.  These\ntransactions are already esteemed by foreigners; and it were only to be\nwished that some subjects in them had been more thoroughly examined, and\nthat others had not been treated at all.  As, for instance, we should\nhave been very well satisfied, had they omitted I know not what\ndissertation on the prerogative of the right hand over the left; and some\nothers, which, though not published under so ridiculous a title, are yet\nwritten on subjects that are almost as frivolous and silly.\nThe Academy of Sciences, in such of their researches as are of a more\ndifficult kind and a more sensible use, embrace the knowledge of nature\nand the improvements of the arts.  We may presume that such profound,\nsuch uninterrupted pursuits as these, such exact calculations, such\nrefined discoveries, such extensive and exalted views, will, at last,\nproduce something that may prove of advantage to the universe.  Hitherto,\nas we have observed together, the most useful discoveries have been made\nin the most barbarous times.  One would conclude that the business of the\nmost enlightened ages and the most learned bodies, is, to argue and\ndebate on things which were invented by ignorant people.  We know exactly\nthe angle which the sail of a ship is to make with the keel in order to\nits sailing better; and yet Columbus discovered America without having\nthe least idea of the property of this angle: however, I am far from\ninferring from hence that we are to confine ourselves merely to a blind\npractice, but happy it were, would naturalists and geometricians unite,\nas much as possible, the practice with the theory.\nStrange, but so it is, that those things which reflect the greatest\nhonour on the human mind are frequently of the least benefit to it!  A\nman who understands the four fundamental rules of arithmetic, aided by a\nlittle good sense, shall amass prodigious wealth in trade, shall become a\nSir Peter Delme, a Sir Richard Hopkins, a Sir Gilbert Heathcote, whilst a\npoor algebraist spends his whole life in searching for astonishing\nproperties and relations in numbers, which at the same time are of no\nmanner of use, and will not acquaint him with the nature of exchanges.\nThis is very nearly the case with most of the arts: there is a certain\npoint beyond which all researches serve to no other purpose than merely\nto delight an inquisitive mind.  Those ingenious and useless truths may\nbe compared to stars which, by being placed at too great a distance,\ncannot afford us the least light.\nWith regard to the French Academy, how great a service would they do to\nliterature, to the language, and the nation, if, instead of publishing a\nset of compliments annually, they would give us new editions of the\nvaluable works written in the age of Louis XIV., purged from the several\nerrors of diction which are crept into them.  There are many of these\nerrors in Corneille and Moliere, but those in La Fontaine are very\nnumerous.  Such as could not be corrected might at least be pointed out.\nBy this means, as all the Europeans read those works, they would teach\nthem our language in its utmost purity--which, by that means, would be\nfixed to a lasting standard; and valuable French books being then printed\nat the King's expense, would prove one of the most glorious monuments the\nnation could boast.  I have been told that Boileau formerly made this\nproposal, and that it has since been revived by a gentleman eminent for\nhis genius, his fine sense, and just taste for criticism; but this\nthought has met with the fate of many other useful projects, of being\napplauded and neglected.", "source": "letters_on_england.txt"}

How can you, said the judicious OULOUG, be so partial, as to\nprefer a Set of Tales, that are no ways interesting or instructive,\nto a Work, that has a Variety of Beauties to recommend it?

I.\n_The Blind_ EYE.\nIn the Reign of King _Moabdar_, there was a young Man, a Native of\n_Babylon_, by name _Zadig_; who was not only endowed by Nature with\nan uncommon Genius, but born of illustrious Parents, who bestowed on\nhim an Education no ways inferior to his Birth. Tho' rich and young,\nhe knew how to give a Check to his Passions; he was no ways\nself-conceited; he didn't always act up to the strictest Rules of\nReason himself, and knew how to look on the Foibles of others, with\nan Eye of Indulgence. Every one was surpriz'd to find, that\nnotwithstanding he had such a Fund of Wit, he never insulted; nay,\nnever so much as rallied any of his Companions, for that Tittle\nTattle, which was so vague and empty, so noisy and confus'd; for\nthose rash Reflections, those illiterate Conclusions, and those\ninsipid Jokes; and, in short, for that Flow of unmeaning Words,\nwhich was call'd polite Conversation in _Babylon_. He had learned\nfrom the first Book of _Zoroaster_, that Self-love is like a Bladder\nfull blown, which when once prick'd, discharges a kind of petty\nTempest. _Zadig_, in particular, never boasted of his Contempt of\nthe Fair Sex, or of his Facility to make Conquests amongst them. He\nwas of a generous Spirit; insomuch, that he was not afraid of\nobliging even an ungrateful Man; strictly adhering to that wise\nMaxim of _Zoroaster_. _When you are eating, throw an Offal to the\nDogs that are under the Table, lest they should be tempted to bite\nyou._ He was as wise as he could well be wish'd; since he was fond\nof no Company, but such as were distinguish'd for Men of Sense. As\nhe was well-grounded, in all the Sciences of the antient\n_Chaldeans_, he was no Stranger to those Principles of Natural\nPhilosophy, which were then known: And understood as much of\nMetaphysics as any one in all Ages after him; that is to say, he\nknew little or nothing of the Matter. He was firmly convinc'd, that\nthe Year consisted of 365 Days and an half, tho' directly repugnant\nto the new Philosophy of the Age he liv'd in; and that the Sun was\nsituated in the Center of the Earth; And when the Chief Magi told\nhim, with an imperious Air, that he maintain'd erroneous Principles;\nand that it was an Indignity offered to the Government under which\nhe liv'd, to imagine the Sun should roll round its own Axis, and\nthat the Year consisted of twelve Months, he knew how to sit still\nand quiet, without shewing the least Tokens of Resentment or\nContempt.\nAs _Zadig_ was immensely rich, and had consequently Friends without\nNumber; and as he was a Gentleman of a robust Constitution, and\nremarkably handsome; as he was endowed with a plentiful Share of\nready and inoffensive Wit: And, in a Word, as his Heart was\nperfectly sincere and open, he imagin'd himself, in some Measure,\nqualified to be perfectly happy. For which Purpose he determin'd to\nmarry a gay young Lady (one _Semira_ by name) whose Beauty, Birth\nand Fortune, render'd her the most desirable Person in all\n_Babylon_. He had a sincere Affection for her, grounded on Honour,\nand _Semira_ conceiv'd as tender a Passion for him. They were just\nupon the critical Minute of a mutual Conjunction in the Bands of\nMatrimony, when, as they were walking Hand in Hand together towards\none of the Gates of _Babylon_, under the Shade of a Row of\nPalm-trees, that grew on the Banks of the River _Euphrates_, they\nwere beset by a Band of Ruffians, arm'd with Sabres, Bows and\nArrows. They were the Guards, it seems, of young _Orcan_ (Nephew of\na certain Minister of State) whom the Parasites, kept by his Uncle,\nhad buoy'd up with a Permission to do, with Impunity, whatever he\nthought proper. This young Rival, tho' he had none of those internal\nQualities to boast of that _Zadig_ had, yet he imagin'd himself a\nMan of more Power; and for that Reason, was perfectly outrageous to\nsee the other preferr'd before him. This Fit of Jealousy, the Result\nof mere Vanity, prompted him to think that he was deeply in Love\nwith the fair _Semira_; and fir'd with that amorous Notion, he was\ndetermin'd to take her away from _Zadig_, by Dint of Arms. The\nRavishers rush'd rudely upon her, and in the Transport of their\nRage, drew the Blood of a Beauty, the Sight of whose Charms would\nhave soften'd the very Tigers of Mount _Imaues_. The injur'd Lady\nrent the very Heavens with her Exclamations. Where's my dear\nHusband, she cried? They have torn me from the Arms of the only Man\nwhom I adore. She never reflected on the Danger to which she was\nexpos'd; her sole Concern was for her beloved _Zadig_. At the same\nTime, he defended her, like a Lover, and a Man of Integrity and\nCourage. With the Assistance only of two domestic Servants, he put\nthose Sons of Violence to Flight, and conducted _Semira_, bloody as\nshe was, and in fainting Fits, to her own House. No sooner was she\ncome to her self, but she fix'd her lovely Eyes on her Dear\nDeliverer. O _Zadig_, said she, I love thee as affectionately, as if\nI were actually thy Bride: I love thee, as the Man, to whom I owe my\nLife, and what is dearer to me, the Preservation of my Honour. No\nHeart sure could be more deeply smitten than that of _Semira_. Never\ndid the Lips of the fairest Creature living utter softer Sounds;\nnever did the most enamoured Lady breathe such tender Sentiments of\nLove and Gratitude for his signal Service; never, in short, did the\nmost affectionate Bride express such Transports of Joy for the\nfondest Husband. Her Wounds, however, were but very superficial, and\nshe was soon recover'd. _Zadig_ receiv'd a Wound that was much more\ndangerous: An unlucky Arrow had graz'd one of his Eyes, and the\nOrifice was deep. _Semira_ was incessant in her Prayers to the Gods\nthat they might restore her _Zadig_. Her Eyes were Night and Day\noverwhelm'd with Tears. She waited with Impatience for the happy\nMoment, when those of _Zadig_ might dart their Fires upon her; but\nalas! the wounded Eye grew so inflam'd and swell'd, that she was\nterrified to the last Degree. She sent as far as _Memphis_ for\n_Hermes_, the celebrated Physician there, who instantly attended his\nnew Patient with a numerous Retinue. Upon his first Visit, he\nperemptorily declared that _Zadig_ would lose his Eye; and foretold\nnot only the Day, but the very Hour when that woful Disaster would\nbefal him. Had it been, said that Great Man, his right Eye, I could\nhave administred an infallible Specific; but as it is, his\nMisfortune is beyond the Art of Man to cure. Tho' all _Babylon_\npitied the hard Case of _Zadig_, they equally stood astonish'd at\nthe profound Penetration of _Hermes_. Two Days after the Imposthume\nbroke, without any Application, and _Zadig_ soon after was perfectly\nrecover'd. _Hermes_ thereupon wrote a very long and elaborate\nTreatise, to prove that his Wound ought not to have been heal'd.\n_Zadig_, however, never thought it worth his while to peruse his\nlearned Lucubrations; but, as soon as ever he could get abroad,\ndetermin'd to pay the Lady a Visit, who had testified such uncommon\nConcern for his Welfare, and for whose Sake alone he wish'd for the\nRestoration of his Sight. _Semira_ he found had been out of Town for\nthree Days; but was inform'd, by the bye, that his intended Spouse,\nhaving conceived an implacable Aversion to a one-ey'd Man, was that\nvery Night to be married to _Orcan_. At this unexpected ill News,\npoor _Zadig_ was perfectly thunder-struck: He laid his Disappointment\nso far to Heart, that in a short Time he was become a mere Skeleton,\nand was sick almost to death for some Months afterwards. At last,\nhowever, by Dint of Reflection, he got the better of his Distemper;\nand the Acuteness of the Pain he underwent, in some Measure,\ncontributed towards his Consolation.\nSince I have met with such an unexpected Repulse, said he, from a\ncapricious Court-Lady, I am determin'd to marry some substantial\nCitizen's Daughter. He pitch'd accordingly upon _Azora_, a young\nGentlewoman extremely well-bred, an excellent Oeconomist, and one,\nwhose Parents were very rich.\nTheir Nuptials accordingly were soon after solemniz'd, and for a\nwhole Month successively, no two Turtles were ever more fond of each\nother. In Process of Time, however, he perceiv'd she was a little\nCoquettish, and too much inclin'd to think, that the handsomest\nyoung Fellows were always the most virtuous and the greatest Wits.\nCHAP. II.\n_The_ NOSE.\nOne Day _Azora_, as she was just return'd home from taking a short\nCountry airing, threw herself into a violent Passion, and swell'd\nwith Invectives. What, in God's Name, my Dear, said _Zadig_, has\nthus ruffled your Temper? What can be the Meaning of all these warm\nExclamations? Alas! said she, you would have been disgusted as much\nas I am, had you been an Eye-witness of that Scene of Female\nFalshood, as I was Yesterday. I went, you must know, to visit the\ndisconsolate Widow _Cosrou_, who has been these two Days erecting a\nMonument to the Memory of her young deceased Husband, near the Brook\nthat runs on one side of her Meadow. She made the most solemn Vow,\nin the Height of her Affliction, never to stir from that Tomb, as\nlong as ever that Rivulet took its usual Course.--Well! and wherein,\npray, said _Zadig_, is the good Woman so much to blame? Is it not an\nincontestable Mark of her superior Merit and Conjugal-Affection?\nBut, _Zadig_, said _Azora_, was you to know how her Thoughts were\nemploy'd when I made my Visit, you'd never forget or forgive her.\nPray, my dearest _Azora_, what then was she about? Why, the\nCreature, said _Azora_, was studying, to be sure, to find out Ways\nand Means to turn the Current of the River.\n_Azora_, in short, harangu'd so long, and, was so big with her\nInvectives against the young Widow, that her too affected, vain Shew\nof Virtue, gave _Zadig_ a secret Disgust.\n_Zadig_ had an intimate Friend, one _Cador_ by Name, whose Spouse\nwas perfectly honest, and had in reality a greater Regard for him,\nthan all Mankind besides: This Friend _Zadig_ made his Confident,\nand bound him to keep a Project of his entirely a Secret, by a\nPromise of some valuable Token of his Respect. _Azora_ had been\nvisiting a Female Companion for two Days together in the Country,\nand on the third was returning home: No sooner, however, was she in\nSight of the House, but the Servants ran to meet her with Tears in\ntheir Eyes, and told her, that their Master dy'd suddenly the Night\nbefore; that they durstn't carry her the doleful Tidings, but were\ngoing to bury _Zadig_ in the Sepulchre of his Ancestors, at the\nBottom of the Garden. She burst into a Flood of Tears; tore her\nHair; and vow'd to die by his Side. As soon as it was dark, young\n_Cador_ came, and begg'd the Favour of being introduc'd to the\nWidow. He was so, and they wept together very cordially. Next Day\nthe Storm was somewhat abated, and they din'd together; _Cador_\ninform'd her, that his Friend had left him the much greater Part of\nhis Effects, and gave her to understand, that he should think\nhimself the happiest Creature in the World, if she would condescend\nto be his Partner in that Demise. The Widow wept, sobb'd, and began\nto melt. More Time was spent in Supper than at Dinner. They\ndiscoursed together with a little more Freedom. _Azora_ was lavish\nof her Encomiums on _Zadig_; but then, 'twas true, she said, he had\nsome secret Infirmities to which _Cador_ was a Stranger. In the\nMidst of their Midnight Entertainment, _Cador_ all on a sudden\ncomplain'd that he was taken with a most violent pleuretic Fit, and\nwas ready to swoon away. Our Lady being extremely concern'd, and\nover-officious, flew to her Closet of Cordials, and brought down\nevery Thing she could think of that might be of Service on this\nemergent Occasion. She was extremely sorry that the famous _Hermes_\nwas gone from _Babylon_, and condescended to lay her warm Hand upon\nthe Part affected, in which he felt such an agonizing Pain. Pray\nSir, said she, in a soft, languishing Tone, are you subject to this\ntormenting Malady? Sometimes, Madam, said _Cador_, so strong, that\nthey bring me almost to Death's Door; and there is but one Thing can\ninfallibly cure me; and that is, the Application of a dead Man's\nNose to the part affected. An odd Remedy truly, said _Azora_. Not\nstranger, Madam, said he, than the Great *_Arnon's_ infallible\nApoplectic Necklaces.\n* There was at this Time in _Babylon_, a famous Doctor,\nnam'd _Arnon_, who both cur'd Apoplectic Fits, and\nprevented them from affecting his Patients, as was\nfrequently advertiz'd in the Gazettes, by a little\nnever-failing Purse that he hung round their Necks.\nThis Assurance of Success, together with _Cador's_ personal Merit,\ndetermin'd _Azora_ in his Favour. After all, said she, when my\nHusband shall be about to cross the Bridge _Tchimavar_, from this\nWorld of Yesterday, to the other, of To-morrow, will the Angel\n_Asrael_, think you, make any Scruple about his Passage, should his\nNose prove something shorter in the next Life than 'twas in this?\nShe would venture, however, and taking up a sharp Razor, repair'd to\nher Husband's Tomb; water'd it first with her Tears, and then\nintended to perform the innocent Operation, as he lay extended\nbreathless, as she thought, in his Coffin. _Zadig_ mounted in a\nMoment; secur'd his Nose with one Hand, and the Incision-Knife with\nthe other. Madam, said he, never more exclaim against the Widow\n_Cosrou_. The Scheme for cutting my Nose off was much closer laid\nthan hers of throwing the River into a new Channel.\nCHAP. III.\n_The_ DOG _and the_ HORSE.\n_Zadig_ found, by Experience, that the first thirty Days of\nMatrimony (as 'tis written in the Book of _Zend_) is Honey-Moon; but\nthe second is all Wormwood. He was oblig'd, in short, as _Azora_\ngrew such a Termagant, to sue out a Bill of Divorce, and to seek his\nConsolation for the future, in the Study of Nature. Who is happier,\nsaid he, than the Philosopher, who peruses with Understanding that\nspacious Book, which the supreme Being has laid open before his\nEyes? The Truths he discovers there, are of infinite Service to him.\nHe thereby cultivates and improves his Mind. He lives in Peace and\nTranquility all his Days; he is afraid of Nobody, and he has no\ntender, indulgent Wife to shorten his Nose for him.\nWrapped up in these Contemplations, he retir'd to a little Country\nHouse on the Banks of the _Euphrates_; there he never spent his Time\nin calculating how many Inches of Water run thro' the Arch of a\nBridge in a second of Time, or in enquiring if a Cube Line of Rain\nfalls more in the _Mouse-Month_, than in that of the _Ram_. He\nform'd no Projects for making Silk Gloves and Stockings out of\nSpiders Webbs, nor of China-Ware out of broken Glass-Bottles; but he\npry'd into the Nature and Properties of Animals and Plants, and\nsoon, by his strict and repeated Enquiries, he was capable of\ndiscerning a Thousand Variations in visible Objects, that others,\nless curious, imagin'd were all alike.\nOne Day, as he was taking a solitary Walk by the Side of a Thicket,\nhe espy'd one of the Queen's Eunuchs, with several of his\nAttendants, coming towards him, hunting about, in deep Concern, both\nhere and there, like Persons almost in Despair, and seeking, with\nImpatience, for something lost of the utmost Importance. Young Man,\nsaid the Queen's chief Eunuch, have not you seen, pray, her\nMajesty's Dog? _Zadig_ very cooly replied, you mean her Bitch, I\npresume. You say very right Sir, said the Eunuch, 'tis a\nSpaniel-Bitch indeed.--And very small said _Zadig_: She has had\nPuppies too lately; she's a little lame with her left Fore-foot, and\nhas long Ears. By your exact Description, Sir, you must doubtless\nhave seen her, said the Eunuch, almost out of Breath. But I have not\nSir, notwithstanding, neither did I know, but by you, that the Queen\never had such a favourite Bitch.\nJust at this critical Juncture, so various are the Turns of\nFortune's Wheel! the best Palfrey in all the King's Stable had broke\nloose from the Groom, and got upon the Plains of _Babylon_. The Head\nHuntsman with all his inferior Officers, were in Pursuit after him,\nwith as much Concern, as the Eunuch about the Bitch. The Head\nHuntsman address'd himself to _Zadig_, and ask'd him, whether he\nhadn't seen the King's Palfrey run by him. No Horse, said _Zadig_,\never gallop'd smoother; he is about five Foot high, his Hoofs are\nvery small; his Tail is about three Foot six Inches long; the studs\nof his Bit are of pure Gold, about 23 Carats; and his Shoes are of\nSilver, about Eleven penny Weight a-piece. What Course did he take,\npray, Sir? Whereabouts is he, said the Huntsman? I never sat Eyes on\nhim, reply'd _Zadig_, not I, neither did I ever hear before now,\nthat his Majesty had such a Palfrey.\nThe Head Huntsman, as well as the Head Eunuch, upon his answering\ntheir Interrogatories so very exactly, not doubting in the least,\nbut that _Zadig_ had clandestinely convey'd both the Bitch and the\nHorse away, secur'd him, and carried him before the grand Desterham,\nwho condemn'd him to the _Knout_, and to be confin'd for Life in\nsome remote and lonely Part of _Siberia_. No sooner had the Sentence\nbeen pronounc'd, but the Horse and Bitch were both found. The Judges\nwere in some Perplexity in this odd Affair, and yet thought it\nabsolutely necessary, as the Man was innocent, to recal their\nDecree. However, they laid a Fine upon him of Four Hundred Ounces of\nGold, for his false Declaration of his not having seen, what\ndoubtless he did: And the Fine was order'd to be deposited in Court\naccordingly: On the Payment whereof, he was permitted to bring his\nCause on to a Hearing before the grand Desterham.\nOn the Day appointed for that Purpose he open'd the Cause himself,\nin Terms to this or the like Effect.\nYe bright Stars of Justice, ye profound Abyss of universal\nKnowledge, ye Mirrors of Equity, who have in you the Solidity of\nLead, the Hardness of Steel, the Lustre of a Diamond, and the\nResemblance of the purest Gold! Since ye have condescended so far,\nas to admit of my Address to this August Assembly, I here, in the\nmost solemn Manner, swear to you by _Orosmades_, that I never saw\nthe Queen's illustrious Bitch, nor the sacred Palfrey of the King of\nKings. I'll be ingenuous, however, and declare the Truth, and\nnothing but the Truth. As I was walking by the Thicket's Side, where\nI met with her Majesty's most venerable chief Eunuch, and the King's\nmost illustrious chief Huntsman, I perceiv'd upon the Sand the\nFootsteps of an Animal, and I easily inferr'd that it must be a\nlittle one. The several small, tho' long Ridges of Land between the\nFootsteps of the Creature, gave me just Grounds to imagine it was a\nBitch whose Teats hung down; and for that Reason, I concluded she\nhad but lately pupp'd. As I observ'd likewise some other Traces, in\nsome Degree different, which seem'd to have graz'd all the Way upon\nthe Surface of the Sand, on the Side of the fore-Feet, I knew well\nenough she must have had long Ears. And forasmuch as I discern'd;\nwith some Degree of Curiosity, that the Sand was every where less\nhollow'd by one Foot in particular, than by the other three, I\nconceiv'd that the Bitch of our most august Queen was somewhat\nlamish, if I may presume to say so.\nAs to the Palfrey of the King of Kings, give me leave to inform you,\nthat as I was walking down the Lane by the Thicket-side, I took\nparticular Notice of the Prints made upon the Sand by a Horse's\nShoes; and found that their Distances were in exact Proportion; from\nthat Observation, I concluded the Palfrey gallop'd well. In the next\nPlace, the Dust of some Trees in a narrow Lane, which was but seven\nFoot broad, was here and there swept off, both on the Right and on\nthe Left, about three Feet and six Inches from the Middle of the\nRoad. For which Reason I pronounc'd the Tail of the Palfrey to be\nthree Foot and a half long, with which he had whisk'd off the Dust\non both Sides as he ran along. Again, I perceiv'd under the Trees,\nwhich form'd a Kind of Bower of five Feet high, some Leaves that had\nbeen lately fallen on the Ground, and I was sensible the Horse must\nhave shook them off; from whence I conjectur'd he was five Foot\nhigh. As to the Bits of his Bridle, I knew they must be of Gold, and\nof the Value I mention'd; for he had rubb'd the Studs upon a certain\nStone, which I knew to be a Touch-stone, by an Experiment that I had\nmade of it. To conclude, by the Prints which his Shoes had left of\nsome Flint-Stones of another Nature, I concluded his Shoes were\nSilver, and of eleven penny Weight Fineness, as I before mention'd.\nThe whole Bench of Judges stood astonish'd at the Profundity of\n_Zadig's_ nice Discernment. The News was soon carried to the King\nand the Queen. _Zadig_ was not only the whole Subject of the Court's\nConversation; but his Name was mention'd with the utmost Veneration\nin the King's Chambers, and his Privy-Council. And notwithstanding\nseveral of their Magi declar'd he ought to be burnt for a Sorcerer;\nyet the King thought proper, that the Fine he had deposited in\nCourt, should be peremptorily restor'd. The Clerk of the Court, the\nTipstaffs, and other petty Officers, waited on him in their proper\nHabit, in order to refund the four Hundred Ounces of Gold, pursuant\nto the King's express Order; modestly reserving only three Hundred\nand ninety Ounces, part thereof, to defray the Fees of the Court.\nAnd the Domesticks swarm'd about him likewise, in Hopes of some\nsmall Consideration.\n_Zadig_, upon winding up of the Bottom, was fully convinc'd, that it\nwas very dangerous to be over-wise; and was determin'd to set a\nWatch before the Door of his Lips for the future.\nAn Opportunity soon offer'd for the Trial of his Resolution. A\nPrisoner of State had just made his Escape, and pass'd under the\nWindow of _Zadig's_ House. _Zadig_ was examin'd thereupon, but was\nabsolutely dumb. However, as it was plainly prov'd upon him, that he\ndid look out of the Window at the same Time, he was sentenc'd to pay\nfive Hundred Ounces of Gold for that Misdemeanor; and moreover, was\noblig'd to thank the Court for their Indulgence; a Compliment which\nthe Magistrates of _Babylon_ expect to be paid them. Good God! said\nhe, to himself, have I not substantial Reason to complain, that my\nimpropitious Stars should direct me to walk by a Wood's-Side, where\nthe Queen's Bitch and the King's Palfrey should happen to pass by?\nHow dangerous is it to pop one's Head out of one's Window? And, in a\nWord, how difficult is it for a Man to be happy on this Side the\nGrave?\nCHAP. IV.\n_The_ ENVIOUS MAN.\nAs _Zadig_ had met with such a Series of Misfortunes, he was\ndetermin'd to ease the Weight of them by the Study of Philosophy,\nand the Conversation of select Friends. He was still possess'd of a\nlittle pretty Box in the Out-parts of _Babylon_, which was furnish'd\nin a good Taste; where every Artist was welcome, and wherein he\nenjoy'd all the rational Pleasures that a virtuous Man could well\nwish for. In the Morning, his Library was always open for the Use of\nthe Learned; at Night his Table was fill'd with the most agreeable\nCompanions; but he was soon sensible, by Experience, how dangerous\nit was to keep learned Men Company. A warm Dispute arose about a\ncertain Law of _Zoroaster_; which prohibited the Eating of Griffins:\nBut to what Purpose said some of the Company, was that Prohibition,\nsince there is no such Animal in Nature? Some again insisted that\nthere must; for otherwise _Zoroaster_ could never have been so weak\nas to give his Pupils such a Caution. _Zadig_, in order to\ncompromize the Matter, said; Gentlemen, If there are such Creatures\nin Being, let us never touch them; and if there are not, we are well\nassur'd we can't touch them; so in either Case we shall comply with\nthe Commandment.\nA learned Man at the upper End of the Table, who had compos'd\nthirteen Volumes, expatiating on every Property of the Griffin, took\nthis Affair in a very serious Light, which would greatly have\nembarrass'd _Zadig_, but for the Credit of a Magus, who was Brother\nto his Friend _Cador_. From that Day forward, _Zadig_ ever\ndistinguish'd and preferr'd good, before learned Company: He\nassociated with the most conversible Men, and the most amiable\nLadies in all _Babylon_; he made elegant Entertainments, which were\nfrequently preceded by a Concert of Musick, and enliven'd by the\nmost facetious Conversation, in which, as he had felt the Smart of\nit, he had laid aside all Thoughts of shewing his Wit, which is not\nonly the surest Proof that a Man has none, but the most infallible\nMeans to spoil all good Company.\nNeither the Choice of his Friends, nor that of his Dishes, was the\nResult of Pride or Ostentation. He took Delight in appearing to be,\nwhat he actually was, and not in seeming to be what he was not; and\nby that Means, got a greater real Character than he actually aim'd\nat.\nDirectly opposite to his House liv'd _Arimazes_, one puff'd up with\nPride, who not meeting with Success in the World, sought his Revenge\nin railing against all Mankind. Rich as he was, it was almost more\nthan he could accomplish, to procure ev'n any Parasites about him.\nTho' the rattling of the Chariots which stopp'd at _Zadig's_ Door\nwas a perfect Nuisance to him; yet the good Character which every\nBody gave him was still a higher Provocation. He would sometimes\nintrude himself upon _Zadig_, and set down at his Table without any\nInvitation; when there, he would most certainly interrupt the Mirth\nof the Company, as Harpies, they say, infect the very Carrion that\nthey eat.\n_Arimazes_ took it in his Head one Day to invite a young Lady to an\nEntertainment; but she, instead of accepting of his Offer, spent the\nEvening at _Zadig's_. Another Time, as _Zadig_ and he were chatting\ntogether at Court, a Minister of State came up to them, and invited\n_Zadig_ to Supper, but took no Notice of _Arimazes_. The most\nimplacable Aversions have frequently no better Foundations. This\nGentleman, who was call'd the _envious Man_, would have taken away\nthe Life of _Zadig_ if he could because most People distinguish'd\nhim by the Title of the _Happy Man_. \"An Opportunity of doing\nMischief, says _Zoroaster_, offers itself a hundred Times a Day; but\nthat of doing a Friend a good Office but once a Year.\"\n_Arimazes_ went one Day to _Zadig's_ House, when he was walking in\nhis Garden with two Friends, and a young Lady, to whom he said\nAbundance of fine Things, with no other Design but the innocent\nPleasure of saying them. Their Conversation turn'd on a War that the\nKing had happily put an End to, between him and his Vassal, the\nPrince of _Hyrcania_. _Zadig_ having signaliz'd himself in that\nshort War, commended his Majesty very highly, but was more lavish of\nhis Compliments on the Lady. He took out his Pocket Book, and wrote\nfour extempore Verses on that Occasion, and gave them the Lady to\nread. The Gentlemen then present begg'd to be oblig'd with a Sight\nof them, as well as the Lady, But either thro' Modesty, or rather a\nself-Consciousness that he hadn't happily succeeded, he gave them a\nflat Denial. He was sensible, that a sudden poetic Flight must prove\ninsipid to every one but the Person in whose Favour it is written,\nwhereupon he snapt the Table in two whereon the Lines were wrote,\nand threw both Pieces into a Rose-bush, where they were hunted for,\nbut to no Purpose. Soon after it happened to rain, and all the\nCompany flew into the House, but _Arimazes_. Notwithstanding the\nShower, he continued in the Garden, and never quitted it, till he\nhad found one Moiety of the Tablet, which was unfortunately broke in\nsuch a Manner, that even the half Lines were good sense, and good\nMetre, tho' very short. But what was still more remarkably\nunfortunate, they appear'd at first View, to be a severe satyr upon\nthe King: The Words were these:\n_To flagrant Crimes\nHis Crown he owes;\nTo peaceful Times\nThe worst of Foes._\nThis was the first Moment that ever _Arimazes_ was happy. He had it\nnow in his Power to ruin the most virtuous and innocent of Men. Big\nwith his execrable Joy, he flew to his Majesty with this virulent\nSatyr of _Zadig's_ under his own Hand. Not only _Zadig_, but his two\nFriends and the Lady were immediately close confin'd. His Cause was\nsoon over; for the Judges turn'd a deaf Ear to what he had to say.\nWhen Sentence of Condemnation was pass'd upon him, _Arimazes_, still\nspiteful, was heard to say, as he went out of Court, with an Air of\nContempt, that _Zadig's_ Lines were Treason indeed, but nothing\nmore. Tho' _Zadig_ didn't value himself on Account of his Genius for\nPoetry; yet he was almost distracted to find himself condemn'd for\nthe worst of Traitors, and his two Friends and the Lady lock'd up in\na Dungeon for a Crime, of which he was no ways guilty. He wasn't\npermitted to speak one Word for himself. His Pocket-Book was\nsufficient Evidence against him. So strict were the Laws of\n_Babylon_! He was carried to the Place of Execution, through a Croud\nof Spectators, who durstn't condole with him, and who flock'd about\nhim, to observe whether his Countenance chang'd, or whether he died\nwith a good Grace. His Relations were the only real Mourners; for\nthere was no Estate in Reversion for them; three Parts of his\nEffects were confiscated for the King's Use, and the fourth was\ndevoted, as a Reward, to the use of the Informer.\nJust at the Time that he was preparing himself for Death, the King's\nParrot flew from her Balcony, into _Zadig's_ Garden, and alighted on\na Rose-bush. A Peach, that had been blown down, and drove by the\nWind from an adjacent Tree, just under the Bush, was glew'd, as it\nwere, to the other Moiety of the Tablet. Away flew the Parrot with\nher Booty, and return'd to the King's Lap. The Monarch, being\nsomewhat curious, read the Words on the broken Tablet, which had no\nMeaning in them as he could perceive, but seem'd to be the broken\nParts of a Tetrastick. He was a great Admirer of Poetry; and the odd\nAdventure of his Parrot, put him upon Reflection. The Queen who\nrecollected full well the Lines that were wrote on the Fragment of\n_Zadig's_ Tablet, order'd that Part of it to be produc'd: Both the\nbroken Pieces being put together, they answered exactly the\nIndentures; and then the Verses which _Zadig_ had written, in a\nFlight of Loyalty, ran thus,\n_Tyrants are prone to flagrant Crimes;\nTo Clemency his Crown he owes;\nTo Concord and to peaceful Times,\nLove only is the worst of Foes._\nUpon this the King order'd _Zadig_ to be instantly brought before\nhim; and his two Friends and the Lady to be that Moment discharg'd.\n_Zadig_, as he stood before the King and Queen, fix'd his Eyes upon\nthe Ground, and begg'd their Majesty's Pardon for his little\nworthless, poetical Attempt. He spoke, however, with such a becoming\nGrace, and with so much Modesty and good Sense, that the King and\nthe Queen, ordered him to be brought before them once again. He was\nbrought accordingly, and he pleas'd them still more and more. In\nshort, they gave him all the immense Estate of _Arimazes_, who had\nso unjustly accus'd him; but _Zadig_ generously return'd the wicked\nInformer the Whole to a Farthing. The envious Man, however, was no\nways affected, but with the Restoration of his Effects. _Zadig_\nevery Day grew more and more in Favour at Court. He was made a Party\nin all the King's Pleasures, and nothing was done in the\nPrivy-Council without him. The Queen, from that very Hour, shew'd\nhim so much Respect, and spoke to him in such soft and endearing\nTerms, that in Process of Time, it prov'd of fatal Consequence to\nherself, her Royal Consort, to _Zadig_, and the whole Kingdom.\n_Zadig_ now began to think it was not so difficult a Thing to be\nhappy as at first he imagin'd.\nCHAP. V.\n_The_ Force _of_ Generosity.\nThe Time now drew near for the Celebration of a grand Festival,\nwhich was kept but once in five Years. 'Twas a constant Custom in\n_Babylon_ at the Expiration of the Term above-mention'd, to\ndistinguish that Citizen from all the Rest, in the most solemn\nManner, who had done the most generous Action; and the Grandees and\nMagi always sat as Judges. The _Satrap_ inform'd them of every\npraise-worthy Deed that occurr'd within his District. All were put\nto the Vote, and the King himself pronounc'd the Definitive\nSentence. People of all Ranks and Degrees came from the remotest\nPart of the Kingdom to be present at this Solemnity. The Victor,\nwhoever he was, receiv'd from the King's own Hand a golden Cup,\nenrich'd with precious Stones, and upon the Delivery, the King made\nuse of the following Salutation. _Receive this Reward of your\nGenerosity, and may the Gods grant me Thousands of such valuable\nSubjects!_\nUpon this memorable Day, the King appear'd in all the Pomp\nimaginable on his Throne of State, surrounded by his Grandees, the\nMagi, and the Deputies, from all the surrounding Nations, of every\nProvince that attended these public Sports, where Honour was to be\nacquir'd, not by the Velocity of the best Race-Horse, or by bodily\nStrength, but by intrinsic Merit. The principal _Satrap_ proclaim'd,\nwith an audible Voice, such Actions as would entitle the Victor to\nthe inestimable Prize; but never mention'd one Word of _Zadig's_\nGreatness of Soul, in returning his invidious Neighbour all his\nEstate, notwithstanding he would have taken away his Life: That was\nbut a Trifle, and not worth speaking of.\nThe first that was set up for the Prize, was a Judge, that had\noccasion'd a Citizen to lose a very considerable Cause, through some\nMistake, for which he was no ways responsible, and made him\nRestitution out of his private Purse.\nThe next Candidate was a Youth, that tho' violently in Love with one\nthat he intended shortly to make his Spouse, yet resign'd her to his\nFriend, who was just expiring at her Feet; and moreover, gave her a\nPortion at the same Time.\nAfter this appear'd a Soldier, who, in the _Hyrcanian_ War, had done\na much more glorious Action than the Lover. A Gang of _Hyrcanians_\nhaving taken his Mistress from him, he fought them bravely, and\nrescued her out of their Hands: Soon after, he was inform'd, that\nanother Band of the same Party had hurried away his Mother to a\nPlace not far distant; he left his Mistress, all drown'd in Tears,\nand ran to his Mother's Assistance: After that Skirmish was over, he\nreturned to his Sweet-heart, and found her just expiring. He would\nfain have plung'd a Dagger into his Heart that Moment; but his\nMother remonstrated to him, that, should he die, she should be\nentirely helpless, and upon that Account only he had Courage to live\na little longer.\nThe Judges seem'd very much inclin'd to give their Votes for the\nSoldier; but the King prevented them, by saying, that the Soldier's\nAction was praise-worthy enough, and so were those of the rest, but\nnone of them give me any Surprize. What _Zadig_ did Yesterday\nperfectly struck me with Astonishment. I'll mention another\nInstance. I had some few Days ago, as a Testimony of my Resentment,\nbanish'd my Prime-Minister, and Favourite _Coreb_ from the Court. I\ncomplain'd of his Conduct in the warmest Terms; and all my\nSycophants about me, told me that I was too merciful; and loaded him\nwith the sharpest Invectives. I ask'd _Zadig_ what his Opinion was\nof _Coreb_; and he dar'd to give him the best of Characters. I must\nconfess, I have read in our publick Records, indeed, of Instances\nwhere Restitution have been generally made, for Injuries committed\nby Mistake; where a Mistress has been resign'd; and where a Mother\nhas been preferr'd to a Mistress; but I never read of a Courtier,\nthat would speak to the Advantage of a Minister in Disgrace, and\nagainst whom the Sovereign was highly incens'd. I'll give 20,000\nPieces of Gold to every Candidate that has been this Day proclaim'd,\nbut I'll give the Cup to no one but _Zadig_.\nSire, said _Zadig_, 'tis your Majesty alone, that deserves the Cup;\n'tis you alone who have done an Action of Generosity, never heard of\nbefore; since you, who are King of Kings, wasn't exasperated against\nyour Slave, when he contradicted you in the Heat of your Passion.\nEvery Body gaz'd with Eyes of Admiration on the King and _Zadig_.\nThe Judge, who had generously made Restitution for his Error; the\nLover, who had married his Mistress to his Friend; the Soldier, who\nhad preferr'd the Welfare of his Mother to that of his Mistress;\nreceived the promis'd Donation from the Monarch, and saw their Names\nregister'd in the Book of _Fame_: But _Zadig_ had the Cup. The King\ngot the universal Character of a good Prince, which he did not long\npreserve. This joyful Day was solemniz'd with Festivals beyond the\nTime by Law establish'd. Tragedies were acted there that drew Tears\nfrom the Spectators; and Comedies that made them laugh; Entertainments,\nthat the _Babylonians_ were perfect Strangers to: The Commemoration\nof it is still preserv'd in _Asia_. Now, said _Zadig_, I am happy at\nlast; but he was grosly mistaken.\nCHAP VI.\n_The_ JUDGMENTS.\nYoung as _Zadig_ was, he was constituted chief Judge of all the\nTribunals throughout the Empire. He fill'd the Place, like one, whom\nthe Gods had endow'd with the strictest Justice, and the most solid\nWisdom. It was to him, the Nations round about were indebted for\nthat generous Maxim; _that 'tis much more Prudence to acquit two\nPersons, tho' actually guilty, than to pass Sentence of Condemnation\nin one that is virtuous and innocent_. It was his firm Opinion, that\nthe Laws were intended to be a Praise to those who did well, as much\nas to be a Terror to Evildoers. It was his peculiar Talent to render\nTruth as obvious as possible: Whereas most Men study to render it\nintricate and obscure. On the very first Day of his Entrance into\nhis High Office, he exerted this peculiar Talent. A rich Merchant,\nand a Native of _Babylon_, died in the _Indies_. He had made his\nWill, and appointed his two Sons Joint-Heirs of his Estate, as soon\nas they had settled their Sister, and married her with their mutual\nApprobation. Moreover, he left a specific Legacy of 30,000 Pieces of\nGold to that Son, who should, after his Decease, be prov'd to love\nhim best. The Eldest erected to his Memory a very costly Monument:\nThe Youngest appropriated a considerable Part of his Bequest to the\nAugmentation of his Sister's Fortune: Every one, without Hesitation,\ngave the Preference to the Elder, allowing the Younger to have the\ngreatest Affection for his Sister. The Legacy therefore was\ndoubtless due to the Eldest.\nTheir Cause came before _Zadig_, and he examin'd them apart. To the\nformer, said _Zadig_, Your Father, Sir, is not dead, as is reported,\nbut being happily recover'd, is on his Return to _Babylon_. God be\npraised, said the young Man! but I hope the Expence I have been at\nin raising this superb Monument will be consider'd. After this,\n_Zadig_ repeated the same Story to the Younger. God be praised, said\nhe! I will immediately restore all that he has left me; but I hope\nmy Father will not recal the little Present I have made my Sister.\nYou have nothing to restore, Sir; you shall have the Legacy of the\nthirty thousand Pieces; for 'tis you that have the greatest\nVeneration for your deceased Father.\nA young Lady that was very rich, had entred into a Marriage-Contract\nwith two _Magis_; and having receiv'd Instructions from both Parties\nfor some Months, she prov'd with Child. They were both ready and\nwilling to marry her. But, said she, he shall be my Husband, that\nhas put me into a Capacity of serving my Country, by adding one to\nit. 'Tis I, Madam, that have answered that valuable End, said one;\nbut the other insisted 'twas his Operation. Well! said she, since\nthis is a Moot-point, I'll acknowledge him for the Father of the\nChild, that will give him the most liberal Education. In a short\nTime after, my Lady was brought to Bed of a hopeful Boy. Each of\nthem insisted on being Tutor, and the Cause was brought before\n_Zadig_. The two Magi were order'd to appear in Court. Pray Sir,\nsaid _Zadig_ to the first, what Method of Instruction do you propose\nto pursue for the Improvement of your young Pupil? He shall first be\ngrounded, said this learned Pedagogue, in the Eight Parts of Speech;\nthen I'll teach him Logic, Astrology, Magick, the wide Difference\nbetween the Terms Substance and Accident, Abstract and Concrete,\n_&c. &c._ As for my Part, Sir, I shall take another Course, said the\nsecond; I'll do my utmost to make him an honest Man, and acceptable\nto his Friends. Upon this, _Zadig_ said, you, Sir, shall marry the\nMother, let who will be the Father.\nThere came daily Complaints to Court against the _Itimadoulet_ of\n_Media_, whose Name was _Irax_. He was a Person of Quality, who was\npossess'd of a very considerable Estate, notwithstanding he had\nsquander'd away a great Part of it, by indulging himself in all\nManner of expensive Pleasures. It was but seldom that an Inferior\nwas suffer'd to speak to him; but not a Soul durst contradict him:\nNo Peacock was more gay; no Turtle more amorous; and no Tortoise\nmore indolent and inactive. He made false Glory and false Pleasures\nhis sole Pursuit.\n_Zadig_, undertaking to cure him, sent him forthwith, as by express\nOrder from the King, a Musick-Master with twelve Voices, and 24\nViolins, as his Attendants; a Head Steward, with six Men Cooks, and\n4 Chamberlains, who were never to be out of his Sight. The King\nissued out his Writ for the punctual Observance of his Royal Will;\nand thus the Affair proceeded.\nThe first Morning, as soon as the voluptuous _Irax_ had open'd his\nEyes, his Musick-Master, with the Voices and Violins, entred his\nApartment. They sang a Cantata, that lasted two Hours and three\nMinutes. Every three Minutes the Chorus, or Burthen of the Song, was\nto this Effect.\n_Tisn't in Words to speak your Praise;\nWhat mighty Honours are your Due!\nTo worth like yours we Altars raise,\nNo Monarch's happier, Sir, than you._\nAfter the Cantata was over, the Chamberlain address'd him in a\nformal Harangue for three Quarters of an Hour without ceasing;\nwherein he took Occasion to extol every Virtue to which he was a\nperfect Stranger; when the Oration was over, he was conducted to\nDinner, where the Musicians were all in waiting, and play'd, as soon\nas he was seated at his Table. Dinner lasted three Hours before he\ncondescended to speak a Word. When he did; you say Right, Sir, said\nthe chief Chamberlain; scarce had he utter'd four Words more, but\nRight, Sir, said the second. The other two Chamberlain's Time was\ntaken up in laughing with Admiration at _Irax's_ Smart Repartees, or\nat least such as he ought to have made. After the Cloth was taken\naway, the adulating Chorus was repeated.\nThis first Day _Irax_ was all in Raptures; he imagin'd, that this\nHonour done him by the King of Kings, was the sole Result of his\nexalted Merit. The second wasn't altogether so agreeable; The third\nprov'd somewhat troublesome; the fourth insupportable; the fifth was\ntormenting; and at last, he was perfectly outrageous at the\ncontinual Peal in his Ears of No Monarch's happier Sir, than you,\nYou say right, _&c._ and at being daily harangu'd at the same Hour.\nWhereupon he wrote to Court, and begg'd of his Majesty to recal his\nChamberlain, his Musick-Master, and all his Retinue, his Head\nSteward and his Cooks, and promis'd, in the most submissive Manner,\nto be less vain, and more industrious for the future. Tho' he didn't\nrequire so much Adulations, nor such grand Entertainments, he was\nmuch more happy; for, as _Sadder_ has it, _One continued Scene of\nPleasure, is no Pleasure at all_.\n_Zadig_ every Day gave incontestable Proofs of his wondrous\nPenetration, and the Goodness of his Heart; he was ador'd by the\nPeople, and was the Darling of the King. The little Difficulties\nthat he met with in the first Stage of his Life, serv'd only to\naugment his present Felicity. Every Night, however, he had some\nunlucky Dream or another, that gave him some Disturbance. One while,\nhe imagin'd himself extended on a Bed of wither'd Plants, amongst\nwhich there were some that were sharp pointed, and made him very\nrestless and uneasy; another Time, he fancied himself repos'd on a\nBed of Roses, out of which rush'd a Serpent, that stung him to the\nHeart with his envenom'd Tongue. Alas! said he, waking, I was one\nwhile upon a Bed of hard and nauseous Plants, and just this Moment\nrepos'd on a Bed of Roses. But then the Serpent.--\nCHAP. VII.\n_The Force of_ JEALOUSY.\nThe Misfortunes that attended _Zadig_ proceeded, in a great Measure,\nfrom his Preferment; but more from his intrinsic Merit. Every Day he\nhad familiar Converse with the King, his Royal Master, and his\naugust Consort, _Astarte_. And the Pleasure arising from thence was\ngreatly enhanc'd from an innate Ambition of pleasing, which, in\nregard to Wit, is the same, as Dress is to Beauty. His Youth, and\ngraceful Deportment, had a greater Influence on _Astarte_, than she\nwas at first aware of. Tho' her Affection for him daily encreas'd;\nyet she was perfectly innocent. _Astarte_ would say, without the\nleast Reserve or Apprehension of Fear, that she was extreamly\npleas'd with the Company of one, who was, not only a Favourite of\nher Husband, but the Darling of the whole Empire. She was\ncontinually speaking in his Commendation before the King: He was the\nSubject of her whole Discourse amongst her Ladies of Honour, who\nwere as lavish of their Praises as herself. Such repeated\nDiscourses, however innocent, made a deeper Impression on her Heart,\nthan she at that Time apprehended. She would every now and then send\n_Zadig_ some little Present or another; which he construed as the\nResult of a greater Value for him than she intended. She said no\nmore of him, as she thought, than a Queen might innocently do, who\nwas perfectly assur'd of his Attachment to her Husband; sometimes,\nindeed, she would express her self with an Air of Tenderness and\nAffection.\n_Astarte_ was much handsomer than either his Mistress _Semira_, who\nhad such a natural Antipathy to a one-eyed Lord, or _Azora_, his\nlate loving Spouse, that would innocently have cut his Nose off. The\nFreedoms which _Astarte_ took, her tender Expressions, at which she\nbegan to blush, the Glances of her Eye, which she would turn away,\nif perceiv'd, and which she fix'd upon his, kindled in the Heart of\n_Zadig_ a Fire, which struck him with Amazement. He did all he could\nto smother it; he call'd up all the Philosophy he was Master of to\nhis Aid; but all in vain, for no Consolation arose from those\nReflections.\nDuty, Gratitude, and an injur'd Monarch, presented themselves before\nhis Eyes, as avenging Deities: He bravely struggled; he triumph'd\nindeed; but this Conquest over his Passions, which he was oblig'd to\ncheck every Moment, cost him many a deep Sigh and Tear. He durst not\ntalk with the Queen any more, with that Freedom which was too\nengaging on both Sides; his Eyes were obnubilated; his Discourse was\nforc'd and unconnected; he turn'd his Eyes another Way; and when,\nagainst his Inclination, they met with those of the Queen, he found,\nthat tho' drown'd in Tears, they darted Flames of Fire: They seem'd\nin Silence to intimate, that they were afraid of being in love with\neach other; and that both burn'd with a Fire which both condemn'd.\n_Zadig_ flew from her Presence, like one beside himself, and in\nDespair; his Heart was over-charg'd with a Burthen, too great for\nhim to bear: In the Heat of his Conflicts, he disclos'd the Secrets\nof his Heart to his trusty Friend _Cador_, as one, who, having long\ngroan'd under the Weight of an inexpressible Anguish of Mind, at\nonce makes known the Cause of his Torments by the Groans, as it\nwere, extorted from him, and by the Drops of a cold Sweat, that\ntrickled down his Cheeks.\n_Cador_ said to him; 'tis now some considerable Time since, I have\ndiscover'd that secret Passion which you have foster'd in your\nBosom, and yet endeavour'd to conceal even from your self. The\nPassions carry along with them such strong Impressions, that they\ncannot be conceal'd. Tell me ingenuously _Zadig_; and be your own\nAccuser, whether or no, since I have made this Discovery, the King\nhas not shewn some visible Marks of his Resentment. He has no other\nFoible, but that of being the most jealous Mortal breathing. You\ntake more Pains to check the Violence of your Passion, than the\nQueen herself does; because you are a Philosopher; because, in\nshort, you are _Zadig_; _Astarte_ is but a weak Woman; and tho' her\nEyes speak too visibly, and with too much Imprudence; yet she does\nnot think her self blame-worthy. Being conscious of her Innocence,\nto her own Misfortune, as well as yours, she is too unguarded. I\ntremble for her; because I am sensible her Conscience acquits her.\nWere you both agreed, you might conceal your Regard for each other\nfrom all the World: A rising Passion, that is smother'd, breaks out\ninto a Flame; Love, when once gratified, knows how to conceal itself\nwith Art. _Zadig_ shudder'd at the Proposition of ungratefully\nviolating the Bed of his Royal Benefactor; and never was there a\nmore loyal Subject to a Prince, tho' guilty of an involuntary Crime.\nThe Queen, however, repeated the Name of _Zadig_ so often, and her\nCheeks glow'd with such a red, when ever she utter'd it; she was one\nwhile so transported, and at another, so dejected, when the\nDiscourse turn'd upon him in the King's Presence; she was in such a\nReverie, so confus'd and stupid, when he went out of the Presence,\nthat her Deportment made the King extremely uneasy. He was convinc'd\nof every Thing he saw, and form'd in his Mind an Idea of a thousand\nThings he did not see. He observ'd, particularly, that _Astarte's_\nSandals were blue; so _Zadig's_ were blue likewise; that as the\nQueen wore yellow Ribbands, _Zadig's_ Turbet was of the same Colour:\nThese were shocking Circumstances for a Monarch of his Cast of Mind\nto reflect on! To a Mind, in short, so distemper'd as his was,\nSuspicions were converted into real Facts.\nAll Court Slaves, and Sycophants, are so many Spies on Kings and\nQueens: They soon discover'd that _Astarte_ was fond, and _Moabdar_\njealous. _Arimazius_, his envious Foe, who was as incorrigible as\never; for Flints will never soften; and Creatures, that are by\nNature venemous, forever retain their Poison. _Arimazius_, I say,\nwrote an anonymous Letter to _Moabdar_, the infamous Recourse of\nsordid Spirits, who are the Objects of universal Contempt; but in\nthis Case, an Affair of the last Importance; because this Letter\ntallied with the baneful Suggestions that Monarch had conceiv'd. In\nshort, his Thoughts were now wholly bent upon Revenge. He determin'd\nto poison _Astarte_ on a certain Night, and to have _Zadig_\nstrangled by Break of Day. Orders for that Purpose were expressly\ngiven to a merciless, inhuman Eunuch, the ready Executioner of his\nVengeance. At that critical Conjuncture, there happen'd to be a\nDwarf, who was dumb, but not deaf, in the King's Apartment. Nobody\nregarded him: He was an Eye and Ear-witness of all that pass'd, and\nyet no more suspected than any irrational Domestic Animal. This\nlittle Dwarf had conceiv'd a peculiar Regard for _Astarte_ and\n_Zadig_: He heard, with equal Horror and Surprize, the King's Orders\nto destroy them both. But how to prevent those Orders from being put\ninto Execution, as the Time was so short, was all his Concern. He\ncould not write, 'tis true, but he had luckily learnt to draw, and\ntake a Likeness. He spent a good Part of the Night in delineating\nwith Crayons, on a Piece of Paper, the imminent Danger that thus\nattended the Queen. In one Corner, he represented the King highly\nincens'd, and giving his cruel Eunuch the fatal Orders; in another,\na Bowl and a Cord upon a Table; in the Center was the Queen,\nexpiring in the Arms of her Maids of Honour, with _Zadig_ strangled,\nand laid dead at her Feet. In the Horizon was the rising Sun, to\ndenote, that this execrable Scene was to be exhibited by Break of\nDay. No sooner was his Design finish'd, but he ran with it to one of\n_Astarte's_ Female Favourites, then in waiting, call'd her up, and\ngave her to understand, that she must carry the Draught to _Astarte_\nthat very Moment.\nIn the mean Time, the Queen's Attendants, tho' it was Dead of Night,\nknock'd at the Door of _Zadig's_ Apartment, wak'd him, and deliver'd\ninto his Hands a Billet from the Queen. At first he could not well\ntell whether he was only in a Dream or not, but soon read the\nLetter, with a trembling Hand, and a heavy Heart: Words can't\nexpress his Surprise, and the Agonies of Despair which he was in\nupon his perusal of the Contents. _Fly_, said she, _Dear_ Zadig,\n_this very Moment; for your Life's in the utmost Danger: Fly, Dear_\nZadig, _I conjure you, in the Name of that fatal Passion, with which\nI have long struggled, and which I now venture to discover, as I\nam to make Atonement for it, in a few Moments, by the Loss of my\nLife. Tho' I am conscious to myself of my Innocence, I find I am to\nfeel the Weight of my Husband's Resentment, and die the Death of a\nTraitor._\n_Zadig_ was scarce able to speak. He order'd his Friend _Cador_ to\nbe instantly call'd, and gave him the Letter the Moment he came,\nwithout opening his Lips. _Cador_ press'd him to regard the\nContents, and to make the best of his Way to _Memphis_. If you\npresume, said he, to have an Interview with her Majesty first, you\ninevitably hasten her Execution; or if you wait upon the King, the\nfatal Consequence will be the same: I'll prevent her unhappy Fate,\nif possible; you follow but your own: I'll give it out, that you are\ngone to the _Indies_: I'll wait on you as soon as the Hurricane is\nblown over, and I'll let you know all that occurs material in\n_Babylon_.\n_Cador_, that Instant, order'd two of the fleetest Dromedaries that\ncould be got, to be in readiness at a private Back-Door belonging to\nthe Court; he help'd _Zadig_ to mount his Beast, tho' ready to drop\ninto the Earth. He had but one trusty Servant to attend him, and\n_Cador_, overwhelm'd with Grief, soon lost Sight of his dearly\nbeloved Friend.\nThis illustrious Fugitive soon reach'd the Summit of a little Hill,\nthat afforded him a fair Prospect of the whole City of _Babylon_:\nBut turning his Eyes back towards the Queen's Palace, he fainted\naway; and when he had recover'd his Senses, he drown'd his Eyes in a\nFlood of Tears, and with Impatience wish'd for Death. To conclude,\nafter he had reflected, with Horror, on the deplorable Fate of the\nmost amiable Creature in the Universe, and of the most meritorious\nQueen that ever liv'd; he for a Moment commanded his Passion, and\nwith a Sigh, made the following Exclamations: What is this mortal\nLife! O Virtue, Virtue, of what Service hast thou been to me! Two\nyoung Ladies, a Mistress, and a Wife, have prov'd false to me; a\nthird, who is perfectly innocent, and ten thousand Times handsomer\nthan either of them, has suffer'd Death, 'tis probable, before this,\non my Account! All the Acts of Benevolence which I have shewn, have\nbeen the Foundation of my Sorrows, and I have been only rais'd to\nthe highest Spoke of Fortune's Wheel, for no other Purpose than to\nbe tumbled down with the greater Force. Had I been as abandon'd as\nsome Miscreants are, I had like them been happy. His Head thus\noverwhelm'd with these melancholy Reflections, his Eyes thus sunk in\nhis Head, and his meagre Cheeks all pale and languid; and, in a\nWord, his very Soul thus plung'd in the Abyss of deep Despair, he\npursu'd his Journey towards _Egypt_.\nCHAP. VIII.\n_The Thrash'd_ WIFE.\n_Zadig_ steer'd his Course by the Stars that shone over his Head.\nThe Constellation of Orion, and the radiant Dog-star directed him\ntowards the Pole of Canope. He reflected with Admiration on those\nimmense Globes of Light, which appear'd to the naked Eye no more\nthan little twinkling Lights; whereas the Earth he was then\ntraversing, which, in Reality, is no more than an imperceptible\nPoint in Nature, seem'd, according to the selfish Idea we generally\nentertain of it, something very immense, and very magnificent. He\nthen reflected on the whole Race of Mankind, and look'd upon them,\nas they are in Fact, a Parcel of Insects, or Reptiles, devouring one\nanother on a small Atom of Clay. This just Idea of them greatly\nalleviated his Misfortunes, recollecting the Nothingness, if we may\nbe allow'd the Expression, of his own Being, and even of _Babylon_\nitself. His capacious Soul now soar'd into Infinity, and he\ncontemplated, with the same Freedom, as if she was disencumber'd\nfrom her earthly Partner, on the immutable Order of the Universe.\nBut as soon as she cower'd her Wings, and resumed her native Seat,\nhe began to consider that _Astarte_ might possibly have lost her\nLife for his Sake; upon which, his Thoughts of the Universe vanish'd\nall at once, and no other Objects appear'd before his distemper'd\nEyes, but his _Astarte_ giving up the Ghost, and himself overwhelm'd\nwith a Sea of Troubles: As he gave himself up to this Flux and\nReflux of sublime Philosophy and Anxiety of Mind, he was insensibly\narriv'd on the Frontiers of _Egypt_: And his trusty Attendant had,\nunknown to him, stept into the first Village, and sought out for a\nproper Apartment for his Master and himself. _Zadig_ in the mean\nTime made the best of his Way to the adjacent Gardens; where he saw,\nnot far distant from the High-way, a young Lady, all drown'd in\nTears, calling upon Heaven and Earth for Succour in her Distress,\nand a Man, fir'd with Rage and Resentment, in pursuit after her. He\nhad now just overtaken her, and she fell prostrate at his Feet\nimploring his Forgiveness. He loaded her with a thousand Reproaches;\nnor did he spare to chastise her in the most outrageous Manner. By\nthe _Egyptian's_ cruel Deportment towards her, he concluded that the\nMan was a jealous Husband, and that the Lady was an Inconstant, and\nhad defil'd his Bed: But when he reflected, that the Woman was a\nperfect Beauty, and to his thinking something like the unfortunate\n_Astarte_, he perceiv'd his Heart yearn with Compassion towards the\nLady, and swell with Indignation against her Tyrant. For Heaven's\nsake, Sir, assist me, said she, to _Zadig_, sobbing as if her Heart\nwould break, Oh! deliver me out of the Hands of this _Barbarian_:\nSave, Sir, O save my Life. Upon these her shocking Outcries, _Zadig_\nthrew himself between the injur'd Lady and the inexorable Brute. And\nas he had some smattering of the _Egyptian_ Tongue, he expostulated\nwith him in his own Dialect, and said: Dear Sir, if you are endow'd\nwith the least Spark of Humanity, let me conjure you to have some\nPity and Remorse for so beautiful a Creature; have some Regard, Sir,\nto the Weakness of her Sex. How can you treat a Lady, who is one of\nNature's Master-pieces, in such a rude and outrageous Manner, one\nwho lies weeping at your Feet for Forgiveness, and one who has no\nother Recourse than her Tears for her Defence? Oh! Oh! said the\njealous-pated Fellow in a Fury to _Zadig_, What! You are one of her\nGallants, I suppose. I'll be reveng'd of thee, thou Villain, this\nMoment. No sooner were the Words out of his Mouth, but he quits hold\nof the Lady, in whose Hair he had twisted his Fingers before, takes\nup his Lance in a Fury, and endeavours to the utmost of his Pow'r to\nplunge it in the Stranger's Heart: _Zadig_, however, being cool,\nwarded the intended Blow with Ease. He laid fast hold of his Lance\ntowards the Point. One strove to recover it, and the other to snatch\nit away by Force. They broke it between them. Whereupon the\n_Egyptian_ drew his Sword. _Zadig_ drew his: They fought: The former\nmade a hundred rash Passes one after another, which the latter\nparried with the utmost Dexterity. The Lady sat herself upon a\nGrass-plat, adjusting her Head-dress, and looking on the Combatants.\nThe _Egyptian_ was too strong for _Zadig_, but _Zadig_ was more\nnimble and active. The latter fought as a Man whose Hand was guided\nby his Head; the former as a Mad-man who dealt about his Blows at\nrandom. _Zadig_ took the Advantage, made a Plunge at him, and\ndisarm'd him. And forasmuch as he found that the _Egyptian_ was\nhotter than ever, and endeavour'd all he could to throw him down by\nDint of Strength, _Zadig_ laid fast hold of him, flew upon him, and\ntripp'd up his Heels: After that, holding the Point of his Sword to\nhis Breast, like a Man of Honour, gave him his Life. The _Egyptian_,\nfir'd with Rage, and having no Command of his Passion, drew his\nDagger, and wounded _Zadig_ like a Coward, whilst the Victor\ngenerously forgave him. Upon that unexpected Action, _Zadig_, being\nincens'd to the last Degree, plung'd his Sword deep into his Bosom.\nThe _Egyptian_ fetch'd a hideous Groan, and died upon the Spot.\n_Zadig_ then approach'd the Lady, and with a kind of Concern, in the\nsoftest Terms told her, that he was oblig'd to kill her Insulter,\ntho' against his Inclinations. I have aveng'd your Cause, and\ndeliver'd you out of the merciless Hands of the most outrageous Man\nI ever saw. Now, Madam, let me know your farther Will and Pleasure\nwith me. You shall die, you Villain! You have murder'd my Love. Oh!\nI could tear your Heart out. Indeed, Madam, said _Zadig_, you had\none of the most hot-headed, oddest Lovers I ever saw. He beat you\nmost unmercifully, and would have taken away my Life because you\ncall'd me in to your Assistance. Would to God he was but alive to\nbeat me again, said she, blubbering and roaring; I deserv'd to be\nbeat. I gave him too just Occasion to be jealous of me. Would to God\nthat he had beat me, and you had died in his Stead! _Zadig_ more\nastonish'd, and more exasperated than ever he was in all his Life,\nsaid to her: Really, Madam, you put on such extravagant Airs, that\nyou tempt me, pretty as you are, to thresh you most cordially in my\nTurn; but I scorn to concern my self any more about you. Upon this,\nhe remounted his Dromedary, and made the best of his Way towards the\nVillage: But before he had got near a hundred Yards, he return'd\nupon an Out-cry that was made by four Couriers from _Babylon_. They\nrode full Speed. One of them, spying the young Widow, cried out.\nThere she is, That's she. She answers in every Respect to the\nDescription we had of her. They never took the least Notice of her\ndead Gallant, but secur'd her directly. Oh! Sir, cried she to\n_Zadig_, again and again, dear Sir, most generous Stranger, once\nmore deliver me from a Pack of Villains. I most humbly beg your\nPardon for my late Conduct and unjust Complaint of you. Do but stand\nmy Friend, at this critical Conjuncture, and I'll be your most\nobedient Vassal till Death. _Zadig_ had now no Inclination to fight\nfor one so undeserving any more. Find some other to be your Fool\nnow, Madam; you shan't impose upon me a second Time. I'll assure\nyou, Madam, I know better Things. Besides he was wounded; and bled\nso fast that he wanted Assistance himself: And 'tis very probable,\nthat the Sight of the _Babylonian_ Couriers, who were dispatch'd\nfrom King _Moabdar_, might discompose him very much. He made all the\nHaste he could towards the Village, not being able to conceive what\nshould be the real Cause of the young Lady's being secur'd by those\n_Babylonish_ Officers, and as much at a Loss, at the same Time, what\nto think of such a Termagant and a Coquet.\nCHAP. IX.\n_The_ CAPTIVE.\nNo sooner was _Zadig_ arriv'd at the _Egyptian_ Village\nbefore-mention'd, but he found himself surrounded by a Croud. The\nPeople one and all cried out! See! See! there's the Man that ran\naway with the beauteous Lady _Missouf_, and murder'd _Cletofis_.\nGentlemen, said he, God forbid that I should ever entertain a\nThought of running away with the Lady you speak of: She is too much\nof a Coquet: And as to _Cletofis_, I did not murder him, but kill'd\nhim in my own Defence. He endeavour'd all he could to take my Life\naway, because I entreated him to take some Pity and Compassion on\nthe beauteous _Missouf_, whom he beat most unmercifully. I am a\nStranger, who am fled hither for Shelter, and 'tis highly\nimprobable, that upon my first Entrance into a Country, where I came\nfor Safety and Protection, I should be guilty of two such enormous\nCrimes, as that of running away with another Man's Partner, and that\nof clandestinely murdering him on her Account.\nThe _Egyptians_ at that Time were just and humane. The Populace, tis\ntrue, hurried _Zadig_ to the Town-Goal; but they took care in the\nfirst Place to stop the Bleeding of his Wounds, and afterwards\nexamin'd the suppos'd Delinquents apart, in order to discover, if\npossible, the real Truth. They acquitted _Zadig_ of the Charge of\nwilful and premeditated Murder; but as he had taken a Subject's Life\naway, tho' in his own Defence, he was sentenc'd to be a Slave, as\nthe Law directed. His two Beasts were sold in open Market, for the\nService of the Hamlet; What Money he had was distributed amongst the\nInhabitants; and he and his Attendant were expos'd in the\nMarket-place to public Sale. An _Arabian_ Merchant, _Setoc_ by Name,\npurchas'd them both; but as the Valet, or Attendant, was a robust\nMan, and better cut out for hard Labour than the Master, he fetch'd\nthe most Money. There was no Comparison to be made between them.\n_Zadig_ therefore was a Slave subordinate to his Valet; they secur'd\nthem both, however, by a Chain upon their Legs; and so link'd they\naccompanied their Master home. _Zadig_, as they were on the Road,\ncomforted his Fellow-Slave, and exhorted him to bear his Misfortunes\nwith Patience: But, according to Custom, he made several Reflections\non the Vicissitudes of human Life. I am now sensible, said he, that\nmy impropitious Fortune has some malignant Influence over thine;\nevery Occurrence of my Life hitherto has prov'd strangely odd and\nunaccountable. In the first Place, I was sentenc'd to die at\n_Babylon_, for writing a short Panegyrick on the King, my Master. In\nthe next, I narrowly escap'd being strangled, for the Queen his\nRoyal Consort's speaking a little too much in my Favour; and here I\nam a joint-Slave with thy self; because a turbulent Fellow of a\nGallant would beat his Lady. However, Comrade, let us march on\nboldly; let not our Courage be cast down; all this may possibly have\na happier Issue than we expect. 'Tis absolutely necessary that these\n_Arabian_ Merchants should have Slaves, and why should not you and\nI, as we are but Men, be Slaves as Thousands of others are? This\nMaster of ours may not prove inexorable. He must treat his Slaves\nwith some Thought and Consideration, if he expects them to do his\nWork. This was his Discourse to his Comrade; but his Mind was more\nattentive to the Misfortunes of the Queen of _Babylon_.\nTwo Days afterwards _Setoc_ set out with his two Slaves and his\nCamels, for _Arabia Deserta_. His Tribe liv'd near the Desert of\n_Horeb_. The Way was long and tedious. _Setoc_, during the Journey,\npaid a much greater Regard to _Zadig's_ Valet, than to himself;\nbecause the former was the most able to load the Camels; and\ntherefore what little Distinctions were made, they were in his\nFavour. It so happen'd that one of the Camels died upon the Road:\nThe Load which the Beast carried was immediately divided, and thrown\nupon the Shoulders of the two Slaves; _Zadig_ had his Share.\n_Setoc_, couldn't forbear laughing to see his two Slaves crouching\nunder their Burthen. _Zadig_ took the Liberty to explain the Reason\nthereof; and convinc'd him of the Laws of the Equilibrium. The\nMerchant was a little startled at his philosophical Discourse, and\nlook'd upon him with a more favourable Eye than at first. _Zadig_,\nperceiving he had rais'd his Curiosity, redoubled it, by instructing\nhim in several material Points, which were in some Measure,\nadvantageous to him in his Way of Business: Such as, the specific\nWeight of Metals, and other Commodities of various Kinds, of an\nequal Bulk; the Properties of several useful Animals, and the best\nWays and Means to make Such as were wild, tame by Degrees, and fit\nfor Service: In short, _Zadig_ was look'd upon by his Master, as a\nperfect Oracle. _Setoc_ now thought the Master the much better Man\nof the two. He us'd him courteously, and had no Room to repent of\nhis Indulgence towards him.\nBeing got to their Journey's End, the first Step that _Setoc_ took\nwas to claim a Debt of five hundred Ounces of Silver of a _Jew_, who\nhad borrow'd it in the Presence of two Witnesses; but both of them\nwere dead; and as the _Jew_ was conscious he couldn't be cast for\nWant of Evidence, appropriated the Merchant's Money to his own Use,\nand thank'd God that it lay in his Power for once to bite an\n_Arabian_ with Impunity. _Setoc_ discover'd to _Zadig_ the unhappy\nSituation of his Case, as he was now become his Confident. Where was\nit, pray, said _Zadig_, that you lent this large Sum to that\nungrateful Infidel? Upon a large Stone, said the Merchant, at the\nFoot of Mount _Horeb_. What sort of a Man is your Debtor, said\n_Zadig_? Oh! he is as errand a Rogue as ever breath'd, reply'd\n_Setoc_. That I take for granted; but, says _Zadig_, is he a lively,\nactive Man, or is he a dull heavy-headed Fellow? He is one of the\nworst of Pay-masters in the World, but the merriest, most sprightly\nFellow I ever met with. Very well! said _Zadig_, let me be one of\nyour Council when your Cause comes to be heard. In short, he\nsummon'd the _Jew_ to attend the Court; where, when the Judge was\nsat, _Zadig_ open'd the Cause: Thou impartial Judge of this Court of\nEquity, I am come here, in behalf of my Master, to demand of the\nDefendant five hundred Ounces of Silver, which he refuses to pay,\nand would fain traverse the Debt. Have you, Friend, your Witnesses\nready to prove the Loan, said the Judge? No, they are dead; but\nthere is a large Stone still subsisting, on which the Money was\ndeposited; and if your Excellence, will be pleas'd to order the\nStone to be brought in Court, I don't doubt but the Evidence it will\ngive, will be Proof sufficient of the Fact. I hope your Excellence\nwill order, that the _Jew_ and myself shall be oblig'd to attend the\nCourt, till the Stone comes, and I'll dispatch a special Messenger\nto fetch it, at my Master's Expence. Your Request is very\nreasonable, said the Judge. Do as you propose; and so call'd another\nCause.\nWhen the Court was ready to break up, Well! said the Judge to\n_Zadig_, is your Stone come yet? The _Jew_, with a Sneer, replied,\nyour Excellence may wait here till this Time To-morrow, before the\nStone will appear in Court; for 'tis above six Mile off, and it will\nrequire fifteen Men to remove it from its Place. 'Tis well! replied\n_Zadig_. I told your Excellence that the Stone would be a very\nmaterial Evidence. Since the Defendant can point out the Place where\nthe Stone lies, he tacitly confesses, that it was upon that Stone\nthe Money was deposited. The _Jew_ thus unexpectedly confuted, was\nsoon oblig'd to acknowledge the Debt. The Judge order'd that the\n_Jew_ should be tied fast to the Stone, without Victuals or Drink,\ntill he should advance the five hundred Ounces of Silver, which were\nsoon paid accordingly, and the _Jew_ releas'd. The Slave _Zadig_,\nand this remarkable Stone-Witness, were in great Repute all over\n_Arabia_.\nCHAP. X.\n_The_ FUNERAL PILE.\n_Setoc_, transported with his good Success, of a Slave made _Zadig_\nhis Favourite Companion and Confident; he found him as necessary in\nthe Conduct of his Affairs, as the King of _Babylon_ had before done\nin the Administration of his Government; and lucky it was for\n_Zadig_ that _Setoc_ had no Wife.\nHe discover'd, that his Master was in his Temper benevolent,\nstrictly honest, and a Man of good natural Parts. _Zadig_ was very\nmuch concern'd, that One of so much Sense should pay divine\nAdoration to a whole Host of created, tho' Celestial Beings, that is\nto say, the Sun, Moon, and Stars, according to the antient Custom of\nthe _Arabians_. He talk'd, at first, to his Master, with great\nPrecaution on so important a Topick. But at last told him, in direct\nTerms, that they were created Bodies, as others, tho' of less\nLustre, and that there was no more Adoration due to them, than to a\nStock or a Stone. But, said _Setoc_, they are eternal Beings to whom\nwe are indebted for all the Blessings we enjoy; they animate Nature;\nthey regulate the Seasons; they are, in a Word, at such an infinite\nDistance from us, that it would be downright impious not to adore\nthem. You are more indebted, said _Zadig_, to the Waters of the Red\nSea, which transport so many valuable Commodities into the _Indies_.\nWhy, pray, may not they be deem'd as antient as the Stars? And if\nyou are so fond of paying your Adoration on Account of their vast\nDistance; why don't you adore the Land of the _Gangarides_, which\nlies in the utmost Extremities of the Earth. No, said _Setoc_, there\nis something so surprisingly more brilliant in the Stars than what\nyou speak of; that a Man must adore them whether he will or not.\nAt the Close of the Evening, _Zadig_ planted a long Range of Candles\nin the Front of his Tent, where _Setoc_ and he were to sup that\nNight: And as soon as he perceiv'd his Patron to be at the Door, he\nfell prostrate on his Knees before the Wax-Lights. O ye everlasting,\never-shining Luminaries, be always propitious to your Votary, said\n_Zadig_. Having repeated these Words so loud as _Setoc_ might hear\nthem, he sat down to Table, without taking the least Notice of\n_Setoc_. What! said _Setoc_, somewhat startled at his Conduct, art\nthou at thy Prayers before Supper? I act just as inconsistently,\nSir, as you do; I worship these Candles; without reflecting on their\nMakers, or yourself, who are my most beneficent Patron.\n_Setoc_ took the Hint, and was conscious of the Reproof that was\nconceal'd so genteely under a Vail. The superior Wisdom of his Slave\nenlightned his Mind; and from that Hour he was less lavish than ever\nhe had been, of his Incense to those created Beings, and for the\nfuture, paid his Adoration to the eternal God who made them.\nAt that Time there was a most hideous Custom in high Repute all over\n_Arabia_, which came originally from _Scythia_; but having met with\nthe Sanction of the bigotted Brachmans, threatn'd to spread its\nInfection all over the _East_. When a married Man happen'd to die,\nif his dearly beloved Widow ever expected to be esteem'd a Saint,\nshe must throw herself headlong upon her Husband's Funeral-Pile.\nThis was look'd upon as a solemn Festival, and was call'd the\nWidow's Sacrifice. That Tribe which could boast of the greatest\nNumber of burnt-Widows, was look'd upon as the most meritorious. An\n_Arabian_, who was of the Tribe of _Setoc_, happen'd just at that\nJuncture, to be dead, and his Widow (_Almona_ by Name) who was a\nnoted Devotee, publish'd the Day, nay, the Hour, that she propos'd\nto throw herself (according to Custom) on her deceased Husband's\nFuneral Pile, and be attended by a Concert of Drums and Trumpets.\n_Zadig_ remonstrated to _Setoc_, what a shocking Custom this was,\nand how directly repugnant to human Nature; by permitting young\nWidows, almost every Day, to become wilful Self-Murderers; when they\nmight be of Service to their Country, either by the Addition of new\nSubjects, or by the Education of such as demanded their Maternal\nIndulgence. And, by arguing seriously with _Setoc_ for some Time, he\nforc'd from him at last, an ingenuous Confession, that the barbarous\nCustom then subsisting, ought, if possible, to be abolish'd. 'Tis\nnow, replied _Setoc_, above a thousand Years since the Widows of\n_Arabia_ have been indulg'd with this Privilege of dying with their\nHusbands; and how shall any one dare to abrogate a Law that has been\nestablish'd Time out of Mind? Is there any Thing more inviolable\nthan even an antient Error? But, replied _Zadig_, Reason is of more\nantient Date than the Custom you plead for. Do you communicate these\nSentiments to the Sovereigns of your Tribes, and in the mean while\nI'll go, and sound the Widow's Inclinations.\nAccordingly he paid her a Visit, and having insinuated himself into\nher Favour, by a few Compliments on her Beauty, after urging what a\npity it was, that a young Widow, Mistress of so many Charms, should\nmake away with herself for no other reason but to mingle her Ashes\nwith a Husband that was dead; he, notwithstanding, applauded her for\nher heroic Constancy and Courage. I perceive, Madam, said he, you\nwas excessively fond of your deceased Spouse. Not I truly, reply'd\nthe young _Arabian_ Devotee. He was a Brute, infected with a\ngroundless Jealousy of my Virtue; and, in short, a perfect Tyrant.\nBut, notwithstanding all this, I am determin'd to comply with our\nCustom. Surely then, Madam, there's a Sort of secret Pleasure in\nbeing burnt alive. Alas! with a Sigh, cried _Almona_, 'tis a Shock\nindeed to Nature; but must be complied with for all that. I am a\nprofess'd Devotee, and should I shew the least Reluctance, my\nReputation would be lost for ever; all the World would laugh at me,\nshould I not burn myself on this Occasion: _Zadig_ having forc'd her\ningenuously to confess, that she parted with her Life more out of\nRegard to what the World would say of her, and out of Pride and\nOstentation, than any real Love for the deceas'd, he talk'd to her\nfor some considerable Time so rationally, and us'd so many\nprevailing Arguments with her to justify her due Regard for the Life\nwhich she was going to throw away, that she began to wave the\nThought, and entertain a secret Affection for her friendly Monitor.\nPray, Madam, tell me, said _Zadig_, how would you dispose of\nyourself, upon the Supposition, that you could shake off this vain\nand barbarous Notion? Why, said Dame, with an amorous Glance, I\nthink verily I should accept of yourself for a second Bed-fellow.\nThe Memory of _Astarte_ had made too strong an Impression on his\nMind, to close with this warm Declaration: He took his leave,\nhowever, that Moment, and waited on the Chiefs. He communicated to\nthem the Substance of their private Conversation, and prevailed with\nthem to make it a Law for the future, that no Widow should be\nallow'd to fall a Victim to a deceased Husband, till after she had\nadmitted some young Man to converse with her in private for a whole\nHour together. The Law was pass'd accordingly, and not one Widow in\nall _Arabia_, from that Day to this, ever observ'd the Custom. 'Twas\nto _Zadig_ alone that the _Arabian_ Dames were indebted for the\nAbolition, in one Hour, of a Custom so very inhuman, that had been\npractis'd for such a Number of Ages. _Zadig_, therefore, with the\nstrictest Justice, was look'd upon by all the Fair Sex in _Arabia_,\nas their most bountiful Benefactor.\nCHAP. XI.\n_The Evening's Entertainment._\n_Setoc_, who would never stir out without his Bosom-Friend (in whom\nalone, as he thought, all Wisdom center'd) resolv'd to take him with\nhim to _Balzora_ Fair, whither the richest Merchants round the whole\nhabitable Globe, us'd annually to resort. _Zadig_ was delighted to\nsee such a Concourse of substantial Tradesmen from all Countries,\nassembled together in one Place. It appear'd to him, as if the whole\nUniverse was but one large Family, and all happily met together at\n_Balzora_. On the second Day of the Fair, he sat down to Table with\nan _Egyptian_, an _Indian_, that liv'd on the Banks of the River\n_Ganges_, an Inhabitant of _Cathay_, a _Grecian_, a _Celt_, and\nseveral other Foreigners, who by their frequent Voyages towards the\n_Arabian_ Gulf, were so far conversant with the _Arabic_ Language,\nas to be able to discourse freely, and be mutually understood. The\n_Egyptian_ began to fly into a Passion; what a scandalous Place is\nthis _Balzora_, said he, where they refuse to lend me a thousand\nOunces of Gold, upon the best Security that can possibly be offer'd.\nPray, said _Setoc_, what may the Commodity be that you would deposit\nas a Pledge for the Sum you mention. Why, the Corpse of my deceased\nAunt, said he, who was one of the finest Women in all _Egypt_. She\nwas my constant Companion; but unhappily died upon the Road. I have\ntaken so much Care, that no Mummy whatever can equal it: And was I\nin my own Country, I could be furnish'd with what Sum soever I\npleas'd, were I dispos'd to mortgage it. 'Tis a strange Thing that\nNobody here will advance so small a Sum upon so valuable a\nCommodity. No sooner had he express'd his Resentment, but he was\ngoing to cut up a fine boil'd Pullet, in order to make a Meal on't,\nwhen an _Indian_ laid hold of his Hand, and with deep Concern, cried\nout, For God's Sake what are you about? Why, said the _Egyptian_, I\ndesign to make a Wing of this Fowl one Part of my Supper. Pray, good\nSir, consider what you are doing, said the _Indian_. 'Tis very\npossible, that the Soul of the deceas'd Lady may have taken its\nResidence in that Fowl. And you wouldn't surely run the Risque of\neating up your Aunt? To boil a Fowl is, doubtless, a most shameful\nOutrage  done  to Nature. Pshaw! What a Pother you make about the\nboiling of a Fowl, and flying in the Face of Nature, replied the\n_Egyptian_ in a Pet; tho' we _Egyptians_ pay divine Adoration to the\nOx; yet we can make a hearty Meal of a Piece of roast Beef for all\nthat. Is it possible, Sir, that your Country-men should act so\nabsurdly, as to pay an Ox the Tribute of divine Worship, said the\n_Indian_? Absurd as you think it, said the other, the Ox has been\nthe principal Object of Adoration all over _Egypt_, for these\nhundred and thirty five thousand Years, and the most abandon'd\n_Egyptian_ has never been as yet so impious as to gain-say it. Ay,\nSir, an hundred thirty five thousand Years, say you, surely you must\nbe out a little in your Calculation. 'Tis but about fourscore\nthousand Years, since _India_ was first inhabited. Sure I am, we are\na more antient People than you are, and our _Brama_ prohibited the\neating of Beef long before your Nation ever erected an Altar in\nHonour of the Ox, or ever put one upon a Spit. What a Racket you\nmake about your _Brama_! Is he able to stand the least in\nCompetition with our _Apis_, said the _Egyptian_? Let us hear, pray,\nwhat mighty Feats have been done by your boasted _Brama_? Why,\nreplied the _Bramin_, he first taught his Votaries to write and\nread; and 'tis to him alone, all the World is indebted for the\nInvention of the noble Game of Chess. You are quite out, Sir, in\nyour Notion, said a _Chaldean_, who sat within Hearing: All these\ninvaluable Blessings were deriv'd from the Fish _Oannes_; and 'tis\nthat alone to which the Tribute of divine Adoration is justly due.\nAll the World will tell you, that 'twas a divine Being whose Tail\nwas pure Gold, whose Head resembled that of a Man, tho' indeed the\nFeatures were much more beautiful; and that he condescended to visit\nthe Earth three Hours every Day, for the Instruction of Mankind. He\nhad a numerous Issue, as is very well known, and all of them were\npowerful Monarchs. I have a Picture of it at Home, to which, as in\nDuty I ought, I Say my Prayers at Night before I go to Bed, and\nevery Morning that I rise. There is no Harm, Sir, as I can conceive,\nin partaking of a Piece of roast Beef; but, doubtless, 'tis a mortal\nSin, a Crime of the blackest Dye, to touch a Piece of Fish. Besides,\nyou cannot justly boast of so illustrious an Origin, and you are\nboth of you mere Moderns, in Comparison to us _Chaldeans_, You\n_Egyptians_ lay claim to no more than 135,000 Years, and you\n_Indians_, but of 80,000. Whereas we have Almanacks that are dated\n4000 Centuries backwards. Take my Word for it; I speak nothing but\nTruth; renounce your Errors, and I'll make each of you a Present of\na fine Portrait of our _Oannes_.\nA Native of _Cambalu_, entring into the Debate, said, I have a very\ngreat Veneration, not only for the _Egyptians_, _Chaldeans_,\n_Greeks_, and _Celtae_; but for _Brama_, _Apis_, and the _Oannes_,\nbut in my humble Opinion, the *_Li_, or as 'tis by some call'd,\nthe *_Tien_, is an Object more deserving of divine Adoration than\nany Ox, or Fish, how much soever you may boast of their respective\nPerfections. All I shall say, in regard to my native Country, 'tis\nof much greater Extent, than all _Egypt_, _Chaldea_, and the\n_Indies_ put together. I shall lay no Stress on the Antiquity of my\nCountry; for I imagine 'tis of much greater Importance to be the\nhappiest People, than the most antient under the Sun. However, since\nyou were talking of the Almanacks, I must beg the Liberty to tell\nyou, that ours are look'd upon to be the best all over _Asia_; and\nthat we had several very correct ones before the Art of Arithmetick\nwas ever heard of in _Chaldea_.\n* _The_ Chinese _Term_, Li, _signifies, properly\nspeaking, natural Light, or Reason; and_ Tien, _the\nHeavens, or the supreme Being._\nYou are all of you a Parcel of illiterate, ignorant Bigots, cry'd a\n_Grecian_: 'Tis plain, you know nothing of the Chaos, and that the\nWorld, as it now stands, is owing wholly to _Matter_ and _Form_. The\n_Greek_ ran on for a considerable Time; but was at last interrupted\nby a _Celt_, who having drank deep, during the whole Time of this\nDebate, thought himself ten Times wiser than any of his Antagonists;\nand wrapping out a great Oath, insisted, that all their Gods were\nnothing, if set in Competition with the _Teutath_ or the Misletoe on\nthe Oak. As for my part, said he, I carry some of it always in my\nPocket: As to my Ancestors, they were _Scythians_, and the only Men\nworth talking of in the whole World: 'Tis true, indeed, they would\nnow and then make a Meal of their Country-men, but that ought not to\nbe urg'd as any Objection to his Country; and, in short, if any one\nof you, or all of you, shall dare to say any thing disrespectful of\n_Teutath_, I'll defend its Cause to the last Drop of my Blood. The\nQuarrel grew warmer and warmer, and _Setoc_ expected that the Table\nwould be overset, and that Blood-shed would ensue. _Zadig_, who\nhadn't once open'd his Lips during the whole Controversy, at last\nrose up, and address'd himself to the _Celt_, in the first Place, as\nbeing the most noisy and outrageous. Sir, said he, Your Notions in\nthis Affair are very just: Good Sir, oblige me with a Bit of your\nMisletoe. Then turning about, he expatiated on the Eloquence of the\n_Grecian_, and in a Word, soften'd in the most artful Manner all the\ncontending Parties. He said but little indeed to the _Cathayian_;\nbecause he was more cool, and sedate than any of the others. To\nconclude, he address'd them all in general Terms, to this or the\nlike Effect: My dear Friends, You have been contesting all this\nwhile about an important Topick, in which 'tis evident, you are all\nunanimously agreed. Agreed, quotha! they all cried, in an angry\nTone, How so, pray? Why said he to the hot, testy _Celt_, is it not\ntrue, that you do not in effect adore this Misletoe, but that Being\nwho created that Misletoe and the Oak, to which it is so closely\nunited? Doubtless, Sir, reply'd the _Celt_. And you, Sir, said he,\nto the _Egyptian_, You revere, thro' your venerable _Apis_, the\ngreat Author of every Ox's Being. We do so, said the _Egyptian_. The\nmighty _Oannes_, tho' the Sovereign of the Sea, continued he, must\ngive Precedence to that Power, who made both the Sea, and every Fish\nthat dwells therein. We allow it, said the _Chaldean_. The _Indian_,\nadds he, and the _Cathayan_, acknowledge one supreme Being, or first\nCause, as well as you. As to what that profound worthy Gentleman the\n_Grecian_ has advanc'd, is, I must own, a little above my weak\nComprehension, but I am fully persuaded, that he will allow there is\na supreme Being on whom his favourite Matter and Form are entirely\ndependent. The _Grecian_, who was look'd upon as a Sage amongst\nthem, said, with Abundance of Gravity, that _Zadig_, had made a very\njust Construction of his Meaning. Now, Gentlemen, I appeal to you\nall, said _Zadig_, whether you are not unanimous to a Man, in the\nDebate upon the Carpet, and whether there are any just Grounds for\nthe least Divisions or Animosities amongst you. The whole Company,\ncool at once, caress'd him; and _Setoc_, after he had sold off all\nhis Goods and Merchandize at a round Price, took his Friend _Zadig_\nHome with him to the Land of _Horeb_. _Zadig_, upon his first\nArrival was inform'd, that a Prosecution had been carried on against\nhim during his Absence, and that the Sentence pronounc'd against him\nwas, that he should be burnt alive before a slow Fire.\nCHAP. XII.\n_The_ RENDEZVOUS.\nWhilst _Zadig_ attended his Friend _Setoc_ to _Balzora_, the Priests\nof the Stars were determin'd to punish him. As all the costly\nJewels, and other valuable Decorations, in which every young Widow\nthat sacrificed her self on her Husband's Funeral-pile, were their\ncustomary Fees, 'tis no great Wonder, indeed, that they were\ninclin'd to burn poor _Zadig_, for playing them such a scurvy Trick.\n_Zadig_ therefore, was accus'd of holding heretical and damnable\nTenets, in regard to the Celestial Host: They depos'd, and swore\npoint-blank, that he had been heard to aver, that the Stars never\nsat in the Sea. This horrid blasphemous Declaration thunder-struck\nall the Judges, and they were ready to rend their Mantles at the\nSound of such an impious Assertion; and they would have made\n_Zadig_, had he been a Man of Substance, paid very severely for his\nheretical Notions. But in the Height of their Pity and Compassion\nfor even such an Infidel, they would lay no Fine upon him; but\ncontent themselves with seeing him roasted alive before a slow Fire.\n_Setoc_, tho' without Hopes of Success, us'd all the Interest he had\nto save his bosom Friend from so shocking a Death; but they turn'd a\ndeaf Ear to all his Remonstrances, and oblig'd him to hold his\nTongue. The young Widow _Almona_, who by this Time was not only\nreconcil'd to living a little longer, but had some Taste for the\nPleasures of Life, and knew that she was entirely indebted to\n_Zadig_ for it, resolv'd, if possible, to free her Benefactor from\nbeing burnt, as he had before convinc'd her of the Folly of it in\nher Case. She ponder'd upon this weighty Affair very seriously; but\nsaid nothing to any one whomsoever. _Zadig_ was to be executed the\nnext Day; and she had only a few Hours left to carry her Project\ninto Execution. Now the Reader shall hear with how much Benevolence\nand Discretion this amiable Widow behav'd on this emergent Occasion.\nIn the first Place, she made use of the most costly Perfumes; and\ndrest herself to the utmost Advantage to render her Charms as\nconspicuous as possible; And thus gaily attir'd, demanded a private\nAudience of the High Priest of the Stars. Upon her first Admittance\ninto his august and venerable Presence, she address'd herself in the\nfollowing Terms. O thou first-born and well-beloved Son of the Great\nBear, Brother of the Bull, and first Cousin to the Dog, (these you\nmust know were the Pontiff's high Titles) I come to confess myself\nbefore you: My Conscience is my Accuser, and I am terribly afraid I\nhave been guilty of a mortal Sin, by declining the stated Custom of\nburning my self on my Husband's Funeral-pile? What could tempt me,\nin short, to a Prolongation of my Life, I can't imagine, I, who am\ngrown a perfect Skeleton, all wrinkled and deform'd. She paus'd, and\npulling off, with a negligent but artful Air, her long silk Gloves;\nShe display'd a soft, plump, naked Arm, and white as Snow: You see,\nSir, said she, that all my Charms are blasted. Blasted, Madam, said\nthe luscious Pontiff; No! Your Charms are still resistless: His\nEyes, and his Mouth, with which he kiss'd her Hand, confirm'd their\nPower: Such an Arm, Madam, by the Great _Orasmades_, I never saw\nbefore. Alas! said the Widow, with a modest Blush; my Arm Sir, 'tis\nprobable, may have the Advantage of any hidden Part; but see, good\nFather, what a Neck is here; as yellow as Saffron, an Object not\nworth regarding. Then she display'd such a snowy, panting Bosom,\nthat Nature could not mend it. A Rose-Bud on an Ivory Apple, would,\nif set in Competition with her spotless Whiteness, make no better\nAppearance than common Madder upon a Shrub; and the whitest Wool,\njust out of the Laver, were she but by, would seem but of a\nlight-brown Hue.\nHer Neck, her large black, sparkling Eyes, that languishingly\nroll'd, and seem'd as 'twere, on Fire; her lovely Cheeks, glowing\nwith White and Red, her Nose, that was not unlike the Tower of Mount\n_Lebanon_, her Lips, which were like two Borders of Coral, inclosing\ntwo Rows of the best Pearls in the _Arabian_ Sea; such a\nCombination, I say, of Charms, made the old Pontiff judge she was\nscarce twenty Years of Age; and in a kind of Flutter, to make her a\nDeclaration of his tender Regard for her. _Almona_, perceiving him\nenamour'd, begg'd his Interest in Favour of _Zadig_. Alas! my dear\nCharmer, my Interest alone, when you request the Favour, would be\nbut a poor Compliment; I'll take care his Acquittance shall be\nsigned by three more of my Brother Priests. Do you sign first,\nhowever, said _Almona_. With all my Soul, said the amorous Pontiff,\nprovided----you'll be kind, my dearest. You do me too much Honour,\nsaid _Almona_; but should you give your self the Trouble to pay me a\nVisit after Sunset, and as soon as the Star _Sheat_ twinkles on the\nHorizon, you shall find me, most venerable Father, repos'd upon a\nrosy-colour'd silver Sopha, where you shall use your Pleasure with\nyour humble Servant. With that she made him a low Courtesy; took up\n_Zadig's_ general Release as soon as duely sign'd, and left the old\nDoatard all over Love, tho' somewhat diffident of his own Abilities.\nThe Residue of the Day he spent in his Bagnio; he drank large\nenlivening Draughts of a Water distill'd from the Cinnamon of\n_Ceilan_, and the costly Spices of _Tidor_ and _Ternate_, and waited\nwith the utmost Impatience for the up-rising of the brilliant\n_Sheat_.\nIn the mean time _Almona_ went to the second Pontiff. He assur'd her\nthat the Sun, Moon, and all the starry Host of Heav'n, were but\nlanguid Fires to her bright Eyes. He put the Question to her, in\nshort, at once, and agreed to sign upon her Compliance. She suffer'd\nherself to be over-persuaded, and made an Assignation to meet him at\na certain Place, as soon as the Star _Algenib_ should make its\nAppearance. From him she repair'd to the third and fourth Pontiff,\ntaking care, wherever she went, to see _Zadig's_ Acquittance duely\nsign'd, and made fresh Appointments at the Rising of Star after\nStar.\nWhen she had carried her Point thus far, she sent a proper Message\nto the Judges of the Court, who had condemn'd _Zadig_, requesting\nthat they would come to her House, that she might advise with them\nupon an Affair of the last Importance. They waited on her\naccordingly; she produc'd _Zadig's_ Discharge duly sign'd by four\nseveral Hands, and told them the Definitive Treaty between all the\ncontracting Parties. Each of the pontifical Gallants observ'd their\nSummons to a Moment. Each was startled at the Sight of his Rival;\nbut perfectly thunderstruck to see the Judges, before whom the Widow\nhad laid open her Case. _Zadig_ procur'd an absolute Pardon, and\n_Setoc_ was so charm'd with the artful Address of _Almona_, that he\nmarried her the next Day. _Zadig_ went afterwards to throw himself\nat the Feet of his fair Benefactress. _Setoc_ and he took their\nLeave of each other with Tears in their Eyes, and vowing that an\neternal mutual Friendship should be preserv'd between them; and, in\nshort, should Fortune at any Time afterwards prove more propitious\nthan could well be expected to either Party; the other should\npartake of an equal Share of his Success.\n_Zadig_ steer'd his Course towards _Syria_; forever pondering on the\nhard Fate of the justly-admir'd _Astarte_, and reflecting on his own\nStars that so obstinately darted down their malignant Rays, and\ncontinu'd daily to torment him. What, said he! to pay four hundred\nOunces of Gold for only seeing a Bitch pass by me; to be condemn'd\nto be beheaded for four witless Verses in Praise of the King; to be\nstrangled to Death, because a Queen was pleas'd to look upon me; to\nbe made a Prisoner, and sold as a Slave for saving a young Lady from\nbeing sorely abus'd by a Brute rather than a Man; and to be upon the\nBrink of being roasted alive, for no other Offence than saving for\nthe future all the Widows in _Arabia_ from becoming idle\nBurnt-Offerings, and mingling their Ashes with those of their\ndeceased worthless Husbands.\nCHAP. XIII.\n_The_ FREE-BOOTER.\n_Zadig_, arriving at the Frontiers which separate _Arabia Petraea_\nfrom _Syria_, and passing by a very strong Castle, several arm'd\n_Arabians_ rush'd out upon him, and surrounding him, cried out:\nWhatever you have belonging to you is our Property, but as for your\nPerson, that is entirely at our Sovereign's Disposal. _Zadig_,\ninstead of making any Reply, drew his Sword, and as his Attendant\nwas a very couragious Fellow, he drew likewise. Those who laid hold\non them, first fell a Sacrifice to their Fury: Their Numbers\nredoubled: Yet still, Both dauntless, determin'd to conquer or to\ndie. When two Men defend themselves against a whole Gang, the\nContest, doubtless, cannot last long. The Master of the Castle, one\n_Arbogad_ by Name, having been an Eye-Witness from his Window, of\nthe Intrepidity and surprising Exploits of _Zadig_, took a Fancy to\nhim. He ran down therefore in Haste, and giving Orders himself to\nhis Vassals to desist, deliver'd the two Travellers out of their\nHands. Whatever Goods or Chattels, said he, come upon my\nTerritories, are my Effects; and whatever I find likewise that is\nvaluable upon the Premises of others, is my free Booty; but, as you\nappear, Sir, to me to be a Gentleman of uncommon Courage, you shall\nprove an Exception to my general Rule. Upon this, he invited _Zadig_\ninto his magnificent Mansion, giving his inferior Officers strict\nOrders to use him with all due Respect; and at Night _Arbogad_ was\ndesirous of supping with _Zadig_. The Lord of the Mansion was one of\nthose _Arabians_, that are call'd _Free-booters_; but a Man who now\nand then did good Actions amongst a Thousand bad ones. He plunder'd\nwithout Mercy; but was liberal in his Benefactions. When in Action,\nintrepid; but in Traffick, easy enough; a perfect _Epicure_ in his\nEating and Drinking, an absolute _Debauchee_, but very frank and\nopen. _Zadig_ pleas'd him extremely; his Conversation being very\nlively, prolong'd their Repast: At last, _Arbogad_ said to him; I\nwould advise you, Sir, to enlist yourself in my Troop; you cannot\npossibly do a better Thing: My Profession is none of the worst; and\nin Time, you may become perhaps as great a Man as myself. May I\npresume, Sir, to ask you one Question; how long may you have\nfollow'd this honourable Calling? From my Youth upwards, replied his\nHost, I was only a _Valet_ at first to an _Arabian_, who indeed was\ncourteous enough; but Servitude was a State of Life I could not\nbrook. It made me stark-mad to see, in a wide World, which ought to\nbe divided fairly between Mankind, that Fate had reserv'd for me so\nscanty a Portion. I communicated my Grievance to an old Sage\n_Arabian_. Son, said he, never despair; once upon a Time, there was\na Grain of Sand, that bemoan'd itself, as being nothing more than a\nworthless _Atom_ of the Deserts. At the Expiration, however, of a\nfew Years, it became that inestimable Diamond, which at this very\nHour, is the richest, and most admir'd Ornament of the _Indian_\nCrown. The old Man's Discourse fir'd me with some Ambition; I was\nconscious to myself that I was at that Time the _Atom_ he mention'd,\nbut was determin'd, if possible, to become the _Diamond_. At my\nfirst setting out, I stole two Horses; then I got into a Gang; where\nwe play'd at small Game, and stopp'd the small Caravans; thus I\ngradually lessen'd the wide Disproportion, which there was at first\nbetween me and the rest of Mankind: I enjoy'd not only my full Share\nof the good Things of this Life, but enjoy'd them with Usury. I was\nlook'd upon as a Man of Consequence, and I procur'd this Castle by\nmy military Atchievements. The _Satrap_ of _Syria_ had Thoughts of\ndispossessing me; but I was then too rich to be any Ways afraid of\nhim; I gave the _Satrap_ a certain Sum of Money, upon Condition that\nI kept quiet Possession of my Castle. And, moreover, I aggrandiz'd\nmy Domains; for he constituted me, at the same Time, Treasurer of\nthe Imports that _Arabia Petraea_ paid to the King of Kings. I\nexecuted my Trust, in every Respect, as I ought, in the Capacity of\na Collector; but I never did, nor never intended to balance my\nAccounts.\nThe grand _Desterham_ of _Babylon_ sent hither, in the Name of the\nKing _Moabdar_, a petty _Satrap_, with a Commission to strangle me.\nHe and his Attendants arriv'd here with his Royal Warrant. I was\nappriz'd of the whole Affair, and, accordingly, order'd his whole\nRetinue, consisting of four inferior Officers, to be strangled\nbefore his Face, after the same Manner as was intended for my\nExecution. After this, I ask'd him what he thought the Commission\nwith which he was entrusted, might reasonably be valued at; he\nanswer'd, that he presum'd his Premium (had he succeeded) might have\namounted to about three Hundred Pieces of Gold. I made him sensible,\nthat it would be for his Interest to be a commission'd Officer under\nme; I made him accordingly Deputy _Free-booter_. He is at this very\nDay not only the best Officer, but the richest I have in all my\nCourt. If my Word may be credited, I'll raise your Fortune as I have\ndone his. Never was Trade brisker in our Way; for _Moabdar_, is\nknock'd on the Head, and all _Babylon_ in the utmost Confusion.\n_Moabdar_ kill'd, said you! cry'd _Zadig_, and pray, Sir, what is\nbecome of his Royal Consort, _Astarte_? I know nothing at all of\nthat Affair, replied _Arbogad_, all that I have to say, is, that\n_Moabdar_ became a perfect Madman, and had his Brains beat out; that\nall the People in _Babylon_ are cutting one another's Throats, and\nthat the whole Empire is laid waste; that there is still an\nOpportunity for making several bold Pushes; and let me tell you,\nSir, I have done my Part, and made the most on't. But the Queen,\nSir, said _Zadig_; pray favour me so far, as to inform me, if you\nknow any Thing of the Queen. I have heard great Talk, said he, of a\ncertain Prince of _Hyrcania_; 'tis very possible, she may have\nlisted herself amongst his Concubines, if she had the good Fortune\nto escape the Resentment of those popular Tumults; but my Head, Sir,\nis better turn'd for the Highway than for News; I have taken several\nLadies Prisoners in the Course of my Excursions; I keep none of them\nfor my Part; and as to such as are handsomer than ordinary, I make\nthe best Market I can of them, without enquiring who they are. Their\nQuality or Titles will fetch no Price at all; a Queen, if she be\nhomely, is worth nothing. 'Tis probable, Sir, I have dispos'd of the\nLady myself; and 'tis possible, likewise, she may be dead; 'tis no\nConcern of mine; and to my thinking, it should be an Affair of no\nManner of Importance to you. After this Declaration, he drank so\nhard, and confounded his Ideas in such a Manner, that _Zadig_ was\nnot one whit the wiser. Upon which he was struck dumb, confounded,\nand stood as motionless as a Statue. _Arbogad_, in the mean while,\nswill'd down whole Bumpers, told a Hundred merry Tales, and swore a\nthousand Times over, that he was the happiest Creature upon God's\nEarth; persuading _Zadig_ to be as merry, and thoughtless as\nhimself. At last, being gradually overcome by the Fumes of his\nLiquor, he fell fast asleep. _Zadig_ spent the Remainder of the\nNight in deep Contemplation, and in all the Uneasiness of Mind\nimaginable. What, said he, the King first became crazy, and then was\nmurder'd. I think I have just Grounds for Complaint. The whole\nEmpire is in Confusion, and torn to Pieces, and this Free-booter is\nas happy as a King. O Fortune! O Fate! a Highwayman as happy as a\nMonarch! and the most amiable Creature that Nature ever fram'd has\nsuffer'd perhaps, an ignominious Death, or perhaps, is in a State of\nLife a thousand Times worse than Death itself! O _Astarte! Astarte!_\nWhat art thou become?\nAs soon as it was Break of Day he went out, and ask'd every one he\nsaw if they knew any Thing of her: But the whole Gang were too\nintent upon other Matters, to return him any Answer. By Virtue of\ntheir Night's Excursions, they had brought in some fresh Booty, and\nwere busy in dividing the Spoil. All the Favour he could procure, in\ntheir Hurry and Tumult, was, to go away without the least\nExamination. He took the Advantage of their Remissness, and mov'd\noff the Premises, but more overwhelm'd with Grief and deep\nReflection than ever.\n_Zadig_, in his March, was very restless and uneasy. His Thoughts\nwere forever rolling on the unfortunate _Astarte_, the King of\n_Babylon_, his Bosom-Friend _Cador_, the happy _Free-booter_,\n_Arbogad_, the fair _Coquet_, that was taken Prisoner on the\nConfines of _Egypt_, by the _Babylonish_ Courier; in a Word, on the\nvarious Scenes of Misfortunes and Disappointments, which he had\nsuccessively met with.\nCHAP. XIV.\n_The_ FISHERMAN.\nWhen _Zadig_ had travelled some few Leagues from _Arbogad's_ Castle,\nhe found himself arriv'd at the Banks of a little River; incessantly\ndeploring, as he went along, his unhappy Fate, and looking upon\nhimself as the very Picture of ill Luck. He perceiv'd at a little\nDistance a Fisherman, reclin'd on a verdant Bank by the River-side,\ntrembling, scarce able to hold his Net in his Hand, (which he seem'd\nbut little to regard) and with uplift Eyes, imploring Heaven's\nAssistance. I am, doubtless, said the poor Fisherman, the most\nunhappy Wretch that ever liv'd! No Merchant in all _Babylon_, it is\nvery well known, was ever so noted for selling Cream-Cheeses as\nmyself; and yet I am ruin'd to all Intents and Purposes. No Man of\nmy Profession ever had a handsomer, more compleat Housewife, than my\nDame was; but I have been treacherously depriv'd of her. I had still\nleft a poor, pitiful Cottage, but that I saw plunder'd and\ndestroy'd. I am cubb'd up here in a Cell; I have nothing to depend\nupon but my Fishery, and not one single Fish have I caught. Thou\nunfortunate Net! I'll never throw thee into the Water more: Much\nsooner will I throw myself in. No sooner were the Words out of his\nMouth, but he started up, and ran to the River-side, like one that\nwas resolutely bent to plunge in, and get rid of a miserable Life at\nonce. Is it possible, said _Zadig_? Is there then the Man in Being\nmore wretched than myself? His Benevolence, and good Will to save\nthe poor Man's Life, was as quick as the Reflection he had just\nmade! He ran to his Assistance; he laid hold of him; and ask'd him,\nwith an Air of Pity and Concern, the Cause of his rash Intention.\n'Tis an old saying, that a Person is less unhappy when he sees\nhimself not singular in Misfortune. But if we will credit\n_Zoroaster_, this is not from a Principle of Malignity, but the\nEffect of a fatal Necessity. He was attracted, as it were, to any\nPerson in Distress, as being One in the same unhappy Circumstances.\nThe Transport of a happy Man, would be a Kind of Insult; but two\nPersons in bad Circumstances, are like two weak Shrubs, which, by\npropping up each other, are fenc'd against a Storm. Why are you thus\ncast down, said _Zadig_ to the Fisherman? Never sink Man, under the\nWeight of your Burden. I can't help it, said the poor Fisherman; I\nhave not the least Prospect of Redress. I was once, Sir, the tip-top\nMan of the whole Village of _Derlbach_, near _Babylon_, where I\nliv'd, and with the Help of my Wife, made the best Cream-Cheeses\nthat were ever eaten in the _Persian_ Empire. Her Majesty, the Queen\n_Astarte_, and the famous Prime-Minister _Zadig_ were very fond of\nthem. I serv'd the Court with about six Hundred of them, I went the\nother Day in Hopes of being paid; but before I had well got into the\nSuburbs of _Babylon_, I was inform'd, that not only the Queen, but\n_Zadig_ too had privately left the Court: Whereupon I ran directly\nto _Zadig's_ House, tho' I never sat Eye on the Man in all my Life.\nThere I found the Court-Marshals of the grand _Desterham_,\nplundering, by Virtue of his Majesty's Mandate, all his Effects, in\nthe most loyal Manner. From thence I made the best of my Way to the\nQueen's Kitchin; where, applying my self to the Steward of her\nHousehold, and his inferior Officers; one of them told me she was\ndead; another, that she was confin'd in Prison; a third, indeed,\nsaid that she had made her Escape by Flight; all in general,\nhowever, assur'd me for my Comfort, that my Cheeses would never be\npaid for. From thence I went, with my Wife in my Hand, to Lord\n_Orcan's_; who was another of my Court-Customers; of whom we begg'd\nfor Shelter and Protection: The Favour, I confess, was readily\ngranted to my Wife; but as for my own Part, I was absolutely\nrejected. She was fairer, Sir, than the fairest Cheese I ever sold;\nfrom whence I date all my Misfortunes; and the red that adorn'd her\nblushing Cheeks was ten Times more lively than any _Tyrian_ Scarlet.\nAnd between you and I, Sir, that was the main Cause of my Wife's\nReception, and my Disgrace. Whereupon I wrote a doleful Letter to my\nWife, in all the Agonies of one in the deepest Despair: 'Tis very\nwell, said she, to the Messenger; I have some little Knowledge of\nthe Man; I have heard say no one sells better Cream-Cheeses than he\ndoes; desire him, next Time he comes, to bring a small Parcel with\nhim, and let him know, I'll take care he shall be punctually paid.\nIn the Height of my Misfortunes, I determin'd to seek Redress in a\nCourt of Equity: I had but six Ounces of Gold left: Two whereof went\nfor a Fee to my Counsellor; two to my Lawyer, who took my Cause in\nHand, and the other two to the Judge's Clerk. Notwithstanding what I\nhad done, my Cause was not so much as commenc'd; and I had already\ndisburs'd more Money than all my Cheeses and my Wife with them were\nworth. I return'd therefore to my Native Habitation, with a full\nResolution to sell it for the Ransom of my Wife.\nMy little Cot, with the Appurtenances, were worth about threescore\nOunces of Gold: But as the Purchasers found I was necessitous, and\ndrove to my last Shifts; the first whom I apply'd to, offer'd me\nthirty Ounces; the second, twenty; and the third, but ten: Just as I\nhad come to Terms of Accommodation with one of them, the Prince of\n_Hyrcania_ came to _Babylon_, and swept all before him. My little\nCottage, with all its Furniture, was first plunder'd of all that was\nvaluable, and at last reduc'd to Ashes.\nHaving thus lost my Money, my Wife, and my House, I withdrew to this\nDesart, where you see me. I have since endeavour'd to get my Bread\nby Fishing; but the Fish, as well as all Mankind, desert me. I\nscarce catch one in a Day; I am half starv'd; and had it not been\nfor your unexpected Benevolence and Generosity, I had been at the\nBottom of the River before this.\nThis long Detail of Particulars, however, was not deliver'd without\nseveral Interruptions; for, said _Zadig_, with Abundance of Warmth\nand Confusion, Have you never heard, Sir, of what is become of the\nQueen _Astarte_? No Sir, not I, said the disconsolate Fisherman; but\nthis I know, to my Sorrow, that neither the Queen, nor _Zadig_, ever\npaid me the least Consideration in the World for my Cream Cheeses;\nthat my dear Spouse is taken from me; and that I am drove to the\nvery Brink of Despair. I am verily persuaded, said _Zadig_, that you\nwill not lose all your Money. I have heard much talk of that same\n_Zadig_; they say he is very honest, and that if ever he returns to\n_Babylon_, as 'tis to be hop'd he will, he'll discharge his Debts\nwith Interest, like a Man of Honour. But, as for your Wife, who\nappears to me, to be no better than a Wag-tail, never take the\nTrouble, if you'll take my Advice, to hunt after her any more. Be\nrul'd, and make the best of your Way to _Babylon_. I shall be there\nbefore you, as I shall ride, and you will be on Foot. Make your\nApplications to the illustrious _Cador_; tell him you met his Friend\nupon the Road; and stay there still I come. Observe my Orders, and\n'tis very probable it may turn out to your Advantage.\nO puissant _Orosmades_, continu'd he, you have made me, 'tis true,\nan Instrument of Comfort to this poor Man; but what Friend will you\nraise for me, to alleviate my Sorrows? Having utter'd this short\nExpostulation, he gave the distrest Fisherman one full Moiety of all\nthe Money he brought with him out of _Arabia_. The Fisherman,\nthunder-struck, and transported with Joy at so unexpected a\nBenefaction, kiss'd the Feet of _Cador's_ Friend, and cried out,\nsure you are a Messenger of Heaven, sent down to be my Saviour!\nIn the mean Time, _Zadig_ every now and then ask'd him Questions,\nand wept as he ask'd them. What! Sir, said the Fisherman, can you,\nwho are so bountiful a Benefactor, be in Distress yourself? Alas!\nsaid he, Friend, I am a hundred Times more unhappy than thou art.\nBut pray, Sir, said the good Man, how can it possibly be, that he,\nwho is so lavish of his Favours, should be overwhelm'd with greater\nMisfortunes than the Man he so generously relieves? Your greatest\nUneasiness, said he, arose from the Narrowness of your Circumstances;\nbut mine proceeds from an internal, and much deeper Cause. Pray, Sir,\nsaid the Fisherman, has _Orcan_ robb'd you of your Wife? This\nInterrogatory put _Zadig_ in a Moment upon a Retrospection of all his\npast Adventures. He recollected the whole Series of his Misfortunes;\ncommencing from that of the Eunuch and the Huntsman, to his Arrival\nat the Free-booter's Castle. Alas! said he, to the Fisherman,\n_Orcan_, 'tis true, deserves severely to be punish'd: But for the\nGenerality, we find, such worthless Barbarians are the Favourites of\nFortune. Be that, however, as it will, go as I bade you, to my Friend\n_Cador_, and wait there till I come. They took their Leave; the\nFisherman blessing his propitious Stars, and _Zadig_ cursing, every\nStep he went, the Hour he was born.\nCHAP. XV.\n_The_ BASILISK.\nAs _Zadig_ was traversing a verdant Meadow, he perceiv'd several\nyoung Female _Syrians_, intent on searching for something very\ncurious, that lay conceal'd, as they imagin'd, in the Grass. He took\nthe Freedom to approach one of them, and ask her, in the most\ncourteous Manner, if he might have the Honour to assist her in her\nResearches. Have a care, said she. What we are hunting after, Sir,\nis an Animal, that will not suffer itself to be touch'd by a Man.\n'Tis somewhat surprizing, said _Zadig_. May I be so bold, pray, as\nto ask you what you are in Pursuit after, that shuns the Touch of\nany Thing but the Hands of the Fair Sex. 'Tis, Sir, said she, the\n_Basilisk_: A _Basilisk_, Madam, said he! And pray, if you will be\nso good as to inform me, with what View, are you searching after a\nCreature so very difficult to be met with? 'Tis, Sir, said she, for\nour Lord and Master _Ogul_, whose Castle, you see, situate on the\nRiver-side, at the Bottom of the Meadow. We are all his Vassals.\n_Ogul_, you must know, is in a very bad State of Health, and his\nfirst Physician has order'd him, as a Specific, to eat a _Basilisk_,\nboil'd in Rose water: And as that Animal is very hard to be catch'd,\nand will suffer nothing to approach it, but one of our Sex, our\ndying Sovereign _Ogul_ has promis'd to honour her, that shall be so\nhappy as to catch it for him, so far as to make her his Consort. The\nCase, being thus circumstantiated, Sir, I hope you will not\ninterrupt me any longer, lest my Rivals here in the Field should\nhappen to circumvent me.\n_Zadig_ withdrew, and left the _Syrian_ Ladies in Quest of their\nimaginary Booty, in order to pursue his intended Journey. But as he\ncame to the Banks of a Rivulet, at the remotest part of the Meadow,\nhe perceiv'd another young Lady, reclin'd on the Grass, and entirely\ndisengag'd. Her Stature seem'd majestic, but her Face was cover'd\nwith a Vail; and her Eyes were fixt, as one at her Looking-glass, on\nthe River. Every now and then a Sigh burst out, as if her Heart were\nbreaking. In her Hand she held a little Wand or Rod, with which she\nwas tracing out some Characters on the dry Sand, that lay between\nthe flow'ry Bank she sat on, and the purling Current. _Zadig's_\nCuriosity induc'd him, unperceiv'd, to observe her Operations at\nsome Distance. But approaching nearer, and perceiving very\ndistinctly the first Character to be an _Z_. the next an _A_. and\nthe third a _D_. he started; but when he saw the additional Capitals\nof _I_ and _G_. his Astonishment was too great for Words to express.\nHe stood for some Time perfectly thunder-struck, and as motionless\nas a Statue; At last, in a soft, faultring Tone, he broke Silence: O\ngenerous Lady, said he, forgive a Stranger, one overwhelm'd with\nSorrows like yourself, if he asks you, by what amazing Accident he\nfinds the Name of _Zadig_ delineated by so angelick a Hand. Thus\nunexpectedly interrupted, and at the Sound of those Words, she\nturn'd her Head; and with a trembling Hand, lifting up her Vail, she\nespy'd _Zadig_ himself. Upon which, she shriek'd; and as her Heart\nwas flutter'd between the two Extreams of Transport and Surprize,\nshe fainted away, and gently dropp'd into his Arms. 'Twas, it seems\n_Astarte_ her self; 'twas the Queen of _Babylon_; 'twas the very\n_Goddess_ whom _Zadig_ ador'd; 'twas, in short, the very identical\nLady, whose hard Fate he had so long deplor'd; and for whose sake he\nhad felt so many agonizing Pains. For a few Minutes he stood\nspeechless, and depriv'd, as it were, of all his senses, whilst his\nEyes were fixt on his _Astarte_, who began to revive; and cast a\nwishful Glance at him, attended with some Confusion. O ye immortal\nPowers, cried he, who preside over the Destiny of us frail Mortals!\nYe have restor'd me my _Astarte_; but alas! at what a Conjuncture,\nin what a Place, and in what a State and Condition do I view her? He\nthrew himself prostrate on the Ground, and kiss'd the Dust of her\nFeet. The Queen of _Babylon_ rais'd him up, and oblig'd him to sit\nby her on the flow'ry Bank whereon she was repos'd. Every now and\nthen she wip'd her Eyes, as the Tears trickl'd down afresh her\nlovely Cheeks. Twenty times she endeavour'd to renew her Discourse;\nbut was interrupted by her Sighs; she ask'd him over and over to\nrelate to her the Hardships he had ran thro' since their parting,\nand by what Chance he came to traverse that solitary Meadow; but\nprevented him at the same Time from returning any Answer, by\nrepeating Question upon Question. At last, she gave him a particular\nDetail of her own Misfortunes, and again requested to know his. Both\nof them, in short, having, in some Measure, appeas'd the Tumult of\ntheir Souls; _Zadig_, in a few Words, inform'd her of the Motives\nthat brought him thither.\nBut tell me, O unfortunate, tho' ever-venerable Queen, how I came to\nfind you out, reclining on this verdant Bank, dress'd in this\nservile Habit, accompanied by other Female Slaves, who, I find, have\nbeen all Day long in Quest after a _Basilisk_, which, as I\nunderstand, is by Order of a celebrated Physician, to be dissolv'd\nin Rose-water, as a specific Medicine for his dying Patient.\nWhilst they busy in their fruitless Search, said the beauteous\n_Astarte_, I'll tell you the whole Series of Sorrows which I have\nundergone since last we parted; and since Heav'n has thus\nunexpectedly blest my Eyes once more with the Sight of my dear\n_Zadig_, I'll no longer exclaim against my impropitious Stars.\nYou are not insensible, that the jealous King my Spouse, was\ndisgusted to find you the most amiable of all Mortals, and that for\nno other Reason he determin'd to strangle you, and poison me. You\nknow very well too, that indulgent Heav'n inspir'd, as it were, my\nlittle Dwarf, with artful Means to give me timely Notice of the rash\nResolutions of the King, my cruel Husband.\nNo sooner had the faithful _Cador_ oblig'd you to obey my Orders, and\nto fly the Court, but he ventur'd to enter my Apartment in the Dead\nof Night thro' a private Door. He snatch'd me up, and convey'd me\ndirectly into the Temple of _Orosmades_, where the holy _Magus_, who\nwas his Brother, lock'd me up in that august and awful Statue, that\nstands erect upon the Pavement of the Temple, and _Colossus_-like,\ntouches the lofty Ceiling with his Head. There I lay conceal'd, or\nrather buried for some Time; tho' taken all imaginable Care of, and\nfurnish'd with all the Necessaries of Life by that venerable, and\nloyal Priest. In the mean Time, his Apothecary enter'd at Break of\nDay into my Apartment, with a Potion in his Hand, compos'd of Opium,\nblack Hellebore, Aconite, and other Ingredients still more baneful.\nWhilst this mercenary Officer of the King's Vengeance was thus\nemploy'd, another as inhuman as himself, went to your Lodgings with\nthe silken Cord. Both, however, were disappointed, as both of us\nwere fled. _Cador_, very officious, flew to the King, in order the\nmore artfully to blind him; and in a feign'd Passion, rail'd at us\nboth, and charg'd us both as perfidious Traitors. As for that\nVillain _Zadig_, said he, he has taken his Flight towards _India_;\nand your false, ungrateful Consort, Sire, said he, is fled to\n_Memphis_. The Guards were order'd that Moment to pursue us both.\nThe Couriers, who flew after me, knew nothing of me. I had never\nexpos'd my Face unveil'd to any one but your self, and that too in\nthe Presence, and by the express Order of my Royal Master. As they\nhad no other Marks to distinguish me from others but my Stature, as\nit had been describ'd, a young Lady, just of my Size, but in all\nProbability much more handsome, presented herself to their View, on\nthe Frontiers of _Egypt_. She was found alone, and in a very\ndisconsolate Condition. This Lady must, doubtless, said they to\nthemselves, be the Queen of _Babylon_: And without listning to her\nComplaints, convey'd her instantly to my Husband _Moabdar_. Their\ngross Blunder at first incens'd his Majesty to the last Degree; but\nafter he had view'd the Lady with an attentive Eye, he found she was\nextremely pretty, and was soon pacify'd. Her Name was _Missouf_. I\nhave been since inform'd, that her Name in the _Egyptian_ Language\nsignifies the _Fair Coquet_. And in Effect, she was so: She had as\nmuch Art, however, as Caprice. For she pleas'd the King of Kings: In\nshort, she had such an Ascendancy over him, that he didn't scruple\nin publick to own her as his Wife. When she had secur'd him thus far\nin her Toils, she never conceal'd her Power, but play'd the Part of\na perfect Humourist. She indulg'd herself in every Whim that came in\nher Head, without Fear of being brow-beat. In the first Place, She\ninsisted that the Chief Magus, who was old and gouty, should dance a\nSaraband before her; and upon his modest Refusal to comply with so\npreposterous a Request, she persecuted him without Mercy: Nothing\nwould serve her Turn, in the next Place, but his Majesty's grand\nMaster of the Horse must make her a Minc'd-pye. The Gentleman took\nthe Liberty to let her know, that he was no profess'd Cook; a Tart,\nhowever, he must make for her, and she got him turn'd out of his\nPlace for being so monstrously careless, as to burn one _Corner_ of\nthe Crust. Whereupon she gave his Post to her favourite Dwarf, and\nmade her Fop of a Page the Keeper of his Majesty's great Seal, and\nConfidence. Thus she reign'd arbitrary, and was the Female Tyrant of\n_Babylon_. All the World deplor'd the Loss of me their former Queen.\nThe King, who never acted the Part of a Tyrant, till the Moment he\nwould have imprison'd me, and strangled you, seem'd to have drown'd\nall his good Qualities in his Dotage on that capricious Enchantress.\nHe came to the Temple on the solemn Festival of the sacred Fire. I\nsaw him prostrate on the Pavement before the Statue, wherein I was\nenclos'd, imploring the Gods to show'r down their choicest Blessings\non his beauteous _Missouf_. I, with an audible and distinct, but\nhollow Tone, address'd my self thus, like an Oracle, to the King of\nKings. _The Gods reject the Vows of a Monarch, that acts the Tyrant\no'er his Subjects; One, who could think of murdering an innocent\nWife; and admit of a worthless Beauty to supply her Place._\n_Moabdar_ was so startled at this unexpected Answer from the God he\nador'd, that he was just at the Point of Distraction. The Oracle\nthat I had deliver'd, and the tyrannical Proceedings of his new\nSpouse _Missouf_, were enough to deprive him of his Senses. In\nshort, in a few Days he became a perfect Mad-man. Her Caprice, which\nseem'd a Judgement from above, portended a sudden Revolution. His\nSubjects accordingly revolted, and were instantly up in Arms.\n_Babylon_, that had so long indulg'd herself in Indolence and Ease,\nbecame the Seat, or Theatre of a bloody Civil War. Whereupon I was\ntaken from my magnificent Prison, the Bowels of his God, and set up\nat the Head of a very powerful Party. Your Friend _Cador_ flew to\n_Memphis_ in hopes to find you there, and bring you back to\n_Babylon_. The Prince of _Hyrcania_, hearing of these intestine\nBroils, return'd with a powerful Army, in order to form a third\nParty, among the _Babylonians_. He attack'd the King, who fled with\nhis fair, but fickle _Egyptian_ before him. _Moabdar_, however, was\nso closely pursu'd, that he dy'd of the Wounds he receiv'd in his\nRetreat. _Missouf_ became the fair Victim of the Conqueror. As for\nmy own Part, I had the Misfortune to be over-power'd likewise, and\ntaken Prisoner by an _Hyrcanian Party_, who brought me into the\nPresence of the young Prince, at the very Juncture when _Missouf_\nstood before him. You'll smile, doubtless, when I tell you the\nPrince look'd upon me as the most amiable Captive of the two; but\nthen, I presume you will be sorry to hear, that my hard Fate doom'd\nme to be a Vassal in his Seraglio. He told me, in direct Terms, that\nas soon as he had put an happy Issue to one Military Expedition,\nwhich would not, he flatter'd himself, be long unexecuted, he would\nhonour me with a Visit. Judge the dreadful Apprehensions I was\nunder, upon his making such a peremptory Declaration. My Obligations\nto _Moabdar_ were all cancell'd, and I was free to be the Bride of\n_Zadig_; but instead of that, I fell into the Toils of a\n_Barbarian_. I answer'd him with all the Resentment becoming one of\nmy high Character and unspotted Virtue. I had always heard say, that\nHeav'n bestow'd on Persons of my Rank, such a peculiar Mark of\nMajesty and Grandeur, that with a bare Word, or the Glance of an\nangry Eye, they could bring down, and abase the Pride of those\naudacious Creatures that durst to thwart their Inclinations. I\ntalk'd as big as a Queen; but I was treated like the most servile\nDomestic. The saucy _Hyrcanian_, without so much as vouchsafing me\none Single Word, turn'd to his black Eunuch, and told him that I was\nvery impertinent; but yet he could not help thinking I was very\npretty. He gave him therefore particular Orders to take care of me,\nand put me under the same Regimen, with respect to my Diet, as one\nof his Favourites, in order that I might recover my Colour, which\nwas somewhat too languid; in a Word, that I might become worthy in a\nlittle Time of his Royal Favours, and be duely qualified to receive\nhim, when he should honour me so far as to fix the Day. I told him,\nI would die first: He replied, with a Sneer, that young Ladies, like\nme, seldom kill'd themselves, and that they were made for Enjoyment;\nand then turn'd upon his Heel, with as careless an Air, as a Man\nwould part with his Paroquet, when he had shut her up close in her\ngilded Cage. What a shocking State was I in for the first Queen of\nthe Universe! Nay, I'll say more, for a Heart that was wholly\ndevoted to her _Zadig_!\nAt these endearing Words, _Zadig_ threw himself at her Feet, and\nbath'd them with his Tears. _Astarte_ immediately rais'd him in the\nmost courteous and engaging Manner, and thus continu'd her\nNarration.--I too plainly perceiv'd, that I was subject to the\nTyranny of a _Barbarian_, and the Rival of a Coquet, that was a\nSlave like myself. She related to me all her past Adventures in\n_Egypt_. From the Description she gave of her Gallant, the Time and\nPlace, the Dromedary he was mounted on, and from every other minute\nCircumstance, I imagin'd it was your self that play'd the Hero in\nher Favour. As I made no Doubt but that you resided somewhere in\n_Memphis_, I determin'd to go thither my self, but in Disguise.\nBeauteous _Missouf_, said I, you are of a much sprightlier\nDisposition than I am; you will be able to amuse the gay young\nPrince of _Hyrcania_ a thousand Times better than I shall. Find out\nsome Way therefore for my Escape; by which you will be sole Lady\nRegent. You will oblige me to the last Degree, by your friendly\nAssistance, and at the same Time get rid of a Rival. _Missouf_,\n(cajol'd with the Hint) came into my Measures directly. She took\ncare to send me packing forthwith, with no other Attendant than an\nold _Egyptian_ Slave.\nNo sooner had I reach'd the Borders of _Arabia_, but a notorious\nFree-booter, (one _Arbogad_ by Name) pick'd me up, as I was\nstrolling along, and sold me to some Merchants, who convey'd me to\nyonder Castle, the magnificent Residence of the Emir _Ogul_. He\npurchas'd me at all Adventures, without enquiring what, or who I\nwas. He is a perfect Debauchee; his sole Delight lies in good\nEating, Wine, and Women; and is one, who imagines, that the Almighty\nsent him into the World for no other Purpose but to gratify his\nunruly Appetites. He is excessively fat, and puffs and blows every\nMoment, like one half choak'd. When he has gorg'd himself so\nunmercifully that he is ready to burst, his chief Physician can\npersuade him to take any Thing for his Relief; tho' he laughs at\nhim, and despises his Advice when he's well and sober. He has\nintimated to him, that at present his Life's in Danger, and nothing\nwill restore him but a _Basilisk_, boil'd in Rose-Water. Whereupon\nthe grand _Ogul_ has promis'd his last Favours to that Slave,\nwhoever she be, that shall be so fortunate as to catch a _Basilisk_,\nfor him, since it seems they are so seldom to be met with. You see I\nhave others to struggle for the Honour propos'd, and I never had a\nless Inclination to find out this _Basilisk_ than at present, since\nI have once more met with my dearest _Zadig_.\nAfter this Declaration, _Astarte_ and _Zadig_ renew'd with Warmth\nthe virtuous Affection which they had long conceiv'd for each other;\nand reciprocally utter'd all the tenderest Expressions that Love in\nDistress could possibly devise. And the _Genii_, who preside over\nall the soft Passions, wafted their mutual Vows of eternal Constancy\nand Truth to the Sphere of _Venus_.\nThe whole Train of Slaves, after a long fruitless Search, attended\non _Ogul_, to inform him that all their strictest Search was\nfruitless. _Zadig_ desired that he might have the Honour to be\nintroduc'd into his Presence. Accordingly he was, and his Address\nwas to this or the like Effect. May immortal Health descend from\nHeaven to preserve a Life, Sir, so precious as yours is. I am a\nPhysician by Profession. I flew to your Palace, on the first News of\nthe dangerous Situation you were in, and have brought a _Basilisk_\nwith me, distill'd in Rose-Water. I can have no Hopes of the Honour\nof your Bed, in Case I succeed in my Application: All the Favour I\nrequest, is, the Release of one of your _Babylonish_ Slaves, who has\nbeen in your Highness's Retinue for some Time. And I am willing to\nbe your Bond-slave in her Stead, if I fail of restoring the most\nillustrious and magnificent _Ogul_ to his pristine State of Health.\nThe Proposition was readily embrac'd. _Astarte_ was instantly\ndischarg'd, and set out for _Babylon_, with a proper Attendant,\naccording to _Zadig's_ Direction; assuring her that she should hear\nevery Day, by a special Courier, of his Proceedings with his new\nPatient. The Farewel which they took of each other, was very\naffectionate and tender, expressive of the strongest Obligations to\neach other. The Moments of Meeting, and those of Parting, are (as it\nis written in the sacred Book of _Zend_) the two most remarkable\n_Epochas_ of a Lover's Life. _Zadig's_ repeated Protestations of\nAffection for the Queen were perfectly sincere, and the pure\nDictates of his Heart; and the Queen's Love for _Zadig_ had made a\ndeeper Impression on hers, than she thought proper to discover.\nIn the mean Time, _Zadig_, again addressing himself to _Ogul_, said;\nmy _Basilisk_, Sir, as others are, is not to be drest or eaten; but\nall its Virtues must penetrate your whole Fabrick, thro' your Pores;\nI have inclos'd my never-failing _Sudorific_ in a Bladder,\nfull-blown and carefully cover'd with the softest Leather. You must\nkick this Bladder, Sir, once a Day about your Hall for a whole Hour\ntogether, with all the Vigour and Activity you possibly can. This\nMedicine must be repeated every Morning, and I'll attend the\nOperation: Upon your due Observance of the Regimen I shall put you\nunder, I doubt not, but with the Blessing of Heav'n on my honest\nEndeavours, I shall give you ample Demonstration of my being an\nAdept in Physick. _Ogul_, upon making the first Experiment, was\nready to expire for want of Breath, and thought he should die with\nthe Fatigue. The second Day did not prove altogether so irksome, and\nhe slept much better at Night than he had done before. In short, our\nDoctor in about eight Days Time, perform'd an absolute Cure. His\nPatient was as brisk, active and gay, as One in the Bloom of his\nYouth.\nNow, Sir, said _Zadig_, I'll be ingenuous with you, and disclose to\nyou the important Secret. You have play'd at Foot-ball these eight\nDays successively; and you have liv'd all that Time, within the\nBounds of Sobriety and Moderation. Know, Sir, that there is no such\nAnimal in Nature as a _Basilisk_; that Health is to be secur'd by\nTemperance and Exercise; and that the Art of making Health\nconsistent with Luxury, is altogether as impracticable, and an Art,\nin all Respects, as idle and chimerical, as those of the\nPhilosopher's Stone, judicial Astrology, or any other Reveries of\nthe like airy and fantastic Nature.\n_Ogul's_ Head-Physician, apprehensive that this unexpected Cure,\nthus wrought by a Stranger, through such an Anti-medicinal\nPreparation, might possibly not only render himself the Object of\nContempt in the Eye of his great Master, but cast a Kind of Slur in\ngeneral on his whole Fraternity, conven'd a Set of petty Doctors and\nApothecaries, who were his Vassals, and entirely devoted to his\nInterest, to find out some sure Ways and Means to cut off in private\nhis dreadful Rival; but whilst their wicked Plot was hatching,\n_Zadig_ receiv'd a Courier from the Queen _Astarte_.\nCHAP. XVI.\n_The_ TOURNAMENTS.\nThe Queen was receiv'd at _Babylon_ with all the Transports of Joy\nthat could possibly be express'd for the safe Return of so\nillustrious and so beautiful a Personage, that had run thro' such a\nlong Series of Misfortunes. _Babylon_ at that Time seem'd to be\nperfectly serene and quiet. As for the young Prince of _Hyrcania_,\nhe was slain in Battle. The _Babylonians_, who were the Victors,\ndeclar'd that _Astarte_ should marry that Candidate for the Crown,\nwho should gain it by a fair and impartial Election. They were\ndetermin'd, that the most valuable Post of Honour in the World,\nnamely, that of being the Royal Consort of _Astarte_, and the\nSovereign of _Babylon_, should be the Result of Merit only; and not\nbe procur'd by any Party-Factions or Court-Intrigues. A solemn Oath\nwas voluntarily taken by all Parties, that he who should distinguish\nhimself by his superior Valour and Wisdom, should unanimously be\nacknowledg'd the Sovereign-Elect.\nA spacious _List_, or _Circus_, was pitched upon, surrounded with\ncommodious Seats, erected in an Amphitheatrical Manner, and richly\nembellish'd some few Leagues from the City. Thither the Combatants,\nor Champions were to repair, compleatly accoutred. Each of them had\na distinct Apartment to himself behind the _Lists_, where no Soul\ncould either see them, or know who they were. They were to enter the\n_Lists_ four several Times. Those who were so happy as to conquer\nfour Competitors, were afterwards to engage each other in single\nCombat; in order that he who should remain Master of the Field\nshould be proclaim'd the happy Victor.\nFour Days afterwards, they were to meet again, accoutred as before,\nand to explain all such _AEnigmas_, or _Riddles_, as the _Magi_\nshould think proper to propose. If their Queries should prove too\nintricate and perplext for them to resolve, they were to have\nRecourse to the _Lists_ again, and after that, to fresh _AEnigmas_,\nbefore they could be entitled to the Election: So that the\n_Tournaments_ were to be continu'd till One of the Candidates should\nbe twice a Victor, and shine as conspicuous, with respect to his\ninternal Qualities, as to his Dexterity and Address in heroic\nAtchievements. The Queen, in the mean Time, was to be narrowly\nwatch'd, and allow'd only to be a Spectator of both their\nAmusements, at some considerable Distance; and moreover, to be\ncover'd with a Vail: Nor was she indulg'd so far as to speak one\nsingle Word to any Candidate whomsoever, in order to prevent the\nleast Jealousy or Suspicion either of Partiality or Injustice.\n_Astarte_ took care, by the Courier, to inform her Lover of all the\nPreliminary Articles abovemention'd, not doubting but that he would\nexert both his Courage and Understanding for her Sake, beyond any of\nthe other Competitors.\n_Zadig_ accordingly set out for _Babylon_, and besought the Goddess\n_Venus_, not only to fortify his Courage, but to illuminate his Mind\nwith Wisdom on this important Occasion.\nThe Night before these martial Atchievements were to commence,\n_Zadig_ arrived upon the Banks of the _Euphrates_. He inscrib'd his\nDevice amongst the List of Combatants; concealing, at the same Time,\nboth his Person and Name, as the Laws of the Election required; and\naccordingly, withdrew to the Apartment that was provided for him,\naccording to his Lot.\n_Cador_, who was just return'd to _Babylon_, having hunted all\n_Egypt_ over to no Purpose, in Hopes to find his Friend _Zadig_,\nbrought a compleat set of Armour into his Lodge, by express Orders\nfrom the Queen: She sent him likewise One of the finest Horses in\nall _Persia_. _Zadig_ knew that these Presents could come from\nNo-body but his dear _Astarte_, which redoubled his Vigour and his\nHopes.\nThe next Morning the Queen being seated under a Canopy of State,\nenrich'd with precious Stones; and the Amphitheatres being crowded\nwith Gentlemen and Ladies of all Ranks and Conditions from\n_Babylon_; the Competitors made their personal Appearance in the\n_Circus_: Each of them went up to the grand _Magus_, and laid down\nhis particular _Device_ at his Feet. The _Devices_ were drawn by\nLot: That of _Zadig_ was the last. The first that advanc'd was a\nGrandee, one _Itabod_ by Name, immensely rich, indeed, and very\nhaughty; but no ways couragious; exceedingly awkward, and a Man of\nno acquir'd Parts. The Sycophants that hover'd round about him\nflatter'd him, that a Man of his Merit couldn't fail of being King:\nHe imperiously replied, One of my Merit must be King: Whereupon he\nwas arm'd _Cap-a-pee_. His Armour was made of pure Gold, enamell'd\nwith Green. The Housings of his Saddle were green, and his Lance\nembellish'd with green Ribbands. Every One was sensible, at first\nSight, by _Itobad's_ Manner of managing his Horse, that he was not\nthe Man whom Heav'n had pitch'd upon to sway the _Babylonish_\nScepter. The first Combatant that tilted with him, threw him out of\nthe Saddle; the second flung him quite over the Crupper, and laid\nhim sprawling on the Ground, with his Heels quiv'ring in the Air.\n_Itobad_, 'tis true, remounted, but with so ill a Grace, that an\nuniversal Laugh went round the Amphitheatre. The third, disdaining\nto use his Lance, made only a Feint at him: Then catch'd hold of his\nRight Leg, and whirling him round, threw him flat upon the Sand. The\nEsquires, who were the Attendants, ran to his Assistance, and with a\nSneer remounted him. The fourth Combatant catch'd hold of his Left\nLeg, and unhors'd him again. He was convey'd thro' the hissing\nMultitude to his Lodge, where, according to the Law in that Case\nprovided, he was to pass the Night. And as he hobbled along, said\nhe, to the Esquires, what a sad Misfortune is this to One of my\nBirth and Character!\nThe other Champions play'd their Parts much better; and all came off\nwith Credit. Some conquer'd two of their Antagonists, and others\nwere so far successful as to get the better of three. None of them,\nhowever, except Prince _Hottam_, vanquish'd four. _Zadig_, at last,\nenter'd the Lists, and dismounted all his four Opponents, one after\nthe other, with the utmost Ease, and with such an Air and Grace, as\ngain'd him universal Applause. As the Case stood thus, _Zadig_ and\n_Hottam_ were to close the Day's Entertainment in a single Combat.\nThe Armour of the latter was of a blue Colour mixt with Gold, and\nthe Housings of his Saddle were of the same. Those of the former\nwhite as Snow. The Multitude were divided in their Wishes. The\nKnight in blue was the Favourite of some of the Ladies; and others\nagain were Admirers of the Cavalier in white. The Queen, whose Heart\nwas in a perfect Palpitation, put up her secret Prayers to _Venus_\nto assist her darling Hero.\nThe two Champions making their Passes and their Volta's, with the\nutmost Dexterity and Address, and keeping firm in their Saddles,\ngave each other such Rebuffs with their Lances, that all the\nSpectators (the Queen only excepted) wish'd for two Kings of\n_Babylon_. At last, their Horses being tired, and both their Lances\nbroke, _Zadig_ made use of the following Stratagem, which his\nAntagonist wasn't any ways appriz'd of. He got artfully behind him,\nand shooting with a Spring on his Horses Buttocks, grasp'd him\nclose, threw him headlong on the Sand, then jump'd into his Seat,\nand wheel'd round Prince _Hottam_, while he lay sprawling on the\nGround. All the Spectators in general, with loud Acclamations, cried\nout, Victory! Victory! in favour of the Champion in white. _Hottam_,\nincens'd to the last Degree, got up, and drew his Sword. _Zadig_\nsprang from his Horse with his Sabre in his Hand. Now, behold the\ntwo Chieftains upon their Legs, commencing a new Trial of Skill!\nwhere they seem'd to get the better of each other alternately; for\nboth were strong, and both were active. The Feathers of their\nHelmets, the Studs of their Bracelets, their Coats of Mail, flew\nabout in Pieces, thro' the dry Blows which they a thousand Times\nrepeated. They struck at each other sometimes with the Edge of their\nSwords, at other Times they push'd, as Occasion offer'd: Now on the\nRight, then on the Left; now on the Head, then at the Breast; they\nretreated; they advanc'd; they kept at a Distance; they clos'd\nagain; they grasp'd each other, turning and twisting like two\nSerpents, and engag'd each other as fiercely as two _Libyan_ Lions\nfighting for their Prey: Their Swords struck Fire almost at every\nBlow. At last, _Zadig_, in order to recover his Breath, for a Moment\nor two stood still, and afterwards, making a Feint at the Prince,\nthrew him on his Back, and disarm'd him. _Hottam_, thereupon, cried\nout, O thou Knight of the white Armour! 'Tis you only are destin'd\nto be the King of _Babylon_. The Queen was perfectly transported.\nThe two Champions were reconducted to their separate Lodges, as the\nothers had been before them, in Conformity to the Laws prescrib'd.\nSeveral Mutes were order'd to wait on the Champions, and carry them\nsome proper Refreshment. We'll leave the Reader to judge whether the\nQueen's Dwarf was not appointed to wait on _Zadig_ on this happy\nOccasion. After Supper the Mutes withdrew, and left the Combatants\nto rest their wearied Limbs till the next Morning; at which Time the\nVictor was to produce his _Device_, before the _Grand Magus_, in\norder to confer Notes, and discover the Hero whoever he might be.\n_Zadig_ slept very sound, notwithstanding his amorous Regard for the\nQueen, being perfectly fatigu'd. _Itabod_, who lay in the Lodge\ncontiguous to his, could not once close his Eyes for Vexation. He\ngot up therefore in the Dead of the Night, stole imperceptibly into\n_Zadig's_ Apartment, took his white Armour and Device away with him,\nand substituted his green One in its Place.\nAs soon as the Day began to dawn, he repair'd, with a seemingly\nundaunted Courage, to the _Grand Magus_, to inform him, that he was\nthe mighty Hero, the happy Victor. Without the least Hesitation, he\ngain'd his Point, and was proclaim'd Victor before _Zadig_ was\nawake. _Astarte_, astonish'd at this unexpected Disappointment,\nreturn'd with a Heart overwhelm'd with Despair, to the Court of\n_Babylon_. Almost all the Spectators were mov'd off from the\nAmphitheatre before _Zadig_ wak'd: He hunted for his Arms; but could\nfind nothing but those in green. He was oblig'd, tho' sorely against\nhis Will, to put it on, having nothing else in his Lodge to appear\nin: Confounded, and big with Resentment, he drest himself, and made\nhis personal Appearance in that despicable Equipage. The Populace\nthat were left behind in the _Circus_, hiss'd him every Step he\ntook, they made a Ring about him, and treated him with all the Marks\nof Ignominy and Contempt. The most cowardly Wretch breathing was\nnever sure so sweated, or hunted down as poor _Zadig_! He grew quite\nout of Patience at last, and cut his Way thro' the insulting Mob,\nwith his Rival's Sabre; but he did not know what Measures to pursue,\nor how to rectify so gross a Mistake. It was not in his Power to\nhave a Sight of the Queen; he could never recover the white Armour\nagain which She had sent him; That was the Compromise, or the\nEngagement, to which the Combatants had all unanimously agreed:\nThus, as he was on the one Hand, plung'd in an Abyss of Sorrow; so\non the other, he was almost drove distracted with Vexation and\nResentment. He withdrew therefore, in a solitary Mood, to the Banks\nof the _Euphrates_, now fully persuaded, that his impropitious Star\nhad shed its most baleful Influence on him, and that his Misfortunes\nwere irretrievable, revolving in his Mind, all his Disappointments\nfrom his first Adventure with the Court-Coquet, who had entertain'd\nan utter Aversion to a blind Eye, down to his late Loss of his white\nArmour. See! said he, the fatal Consequence of being a Sluggard! Had\nI been more vigilant, I had been King of _Babylon_; but what is\nmore, I had been happy in the Embraces of my dearest _Astarte_. All\nthe Knowledge of Books or Mankind; all the personal Valour that I\ncan boast of, has only prov'd an Aggravation of my Sorrows. He\ncarried the Point so far at last, as to murmur at the unequal\nDispensations of Divine Providence; and was tempted to believe, that\nall Occurrences were govern'd by a malignant Destiny, which never\nfail'd to oppress the Virtuous, and always crown'd the Actions of\nsuch Villains as the green Knight, with uncommon Success. In one of\nhis frantick Fits, he put on the green Armour, that had created him\nsuch a World of Disgrace. A Merchant happening to pass by, he sold\nit to him for a Trifle, and took in Exchange nothing more than a\nMantle, and a Cap. In this Disguise, he took a solitary Walk along\nthe Banks of the _Euphrates_, every Minute reflecting in his Mind on\nthe partial Proceedings of Providence, which never ceas'd to torment\nhim.\nCHAP. XVII.\n_The_ HERMIT.\nAs _Zadig_ was travelling along, he met with a Hermit, whose grey\nand venerable Beard descended to his Girdle. He had in his Hand a\nlittle Book, on which his Eyes were fix'd. _Zadig_ threw himself in\nhis Way, and made him a profound Bow. The Hermit return'd the\nCompliment with such an Air of Majesty and Benevolence, that\n_Zadig's_ Curiosity prompted him to converse with so agreeable a\nStranger. Pray, Sir, said he, what may be the Contents of the\nTreatise you are reading with such Attention. 'Tis call'd, said the\nHermit, the _Book of Fate_; will you please to look at it. He put\nthe Book into the Hands of _Zadig_, who, tho' he was a perfect\nMaster of several Languages, couldn't decypher one single Character.\nThis rais'd his Curiosity still higher. You seem dejected, said the\ngood Father to him. Alas! I have Cause enough, said _Zadig_. If\nyou'll permit me to accompany you, said the old Hermit, perhaps I\nmay be of some Service to you. I have sometimes instill'd Sentiments\nof Consolation into the Minds of the Afflicted. _Zadig_ had a secret\nRegard for the Air of the old Man, for his Beard, and his Book. He\nfound, by conversing with him, that he was the most learned Person\nhe had ever met with. The Hermit harangu'd on Destiny, Justice,\nMorality, the sovereign Good, the Frailty of Nature; on Virtue and\nVice, in such a lively Manner, and in such a Flow of Words, that\n_Zadig_ was attach'd to him by an invincible Charm. He begg'd\nearnestly that he would favour him with his Company to _Babylon_.\nThat Favour I was going to ask my self, said the old Man. Swear to\nme by _Orosmades_, that you won't leave me, for some Days at least,\nlet me do what I please. _Zadig_ took the Oath requir'd, and both\npursu'd their Journey.\nThe two Travellers arriv'd that Evening at a superb Castle. The\nHermit begg'd for an hospitable Reception of himself and his young\nComrade. The Porter, whom any One might have taken for some Grandee,\nlet them in, but with a kind of Coldness and Contempt. However, he\nconducted them to the Head-Steward, who went with them thro' every\nrich Apartment of his Master's House. They were seated at Supper\nafterwards at the lower End, indeed, of the Table, and where they\nwere taken little or no Notice of by the Host; but they were serv'd\nwith as much Delicacy and Profusion, as any of the other Guests.\nWhen they arose from Table, they wash'd their Hands in a Golden\nBason set with Emeralds, and other costly Stones. When 'twas Time to\ngo to Rest, they were conducted into a Bed-chamber richly furnish'd;\nand the next Morning two Pieces of Gold were presented to him for\ntheir mutual Service, by a Valet in waiting; and then they were\ndismiss'd.\nThe Proprietor of this Castle, said _Zadig_, as they were upon the\nRoad, seems to me to be a very hospitable Gentleman; tho' somewhat\ntoo haughty indeed, and too imperious: The Words were no sooner out\nof his Mouth, but he perceiv'd that the Pocket of his Comrade's\nGarment, tho' very large, was swell'd, and greatly extended: He soon\nsaw what was the Cause, and that he had clandestinely brought off\nthe Golden Laver. He durst not immediately take Notice of the Fact;\nbut was ready to sink at the very Thoughts on't. About Noon, the\nHermit rapp'd at a petty Cottage with his Staff, the beggarly\nResidence of an old, rich Miser. He desir'd that he and his\nCompanion might refresh themselves there for a few Hours. An old,\nshabby Domestick let them in indeed, but with visible Reluctance,\nand carried them into the Stable, where all their Fare was a few\nmusty Olives, and a Draught or two of sower small Beer. The Hermit\nseem'd as content with his Repast, as he was the Night before. At\nlast, rising off from his Seat, he paid his Compliments to the old\nValet (who had as watchful an Eye over them all the Time, as if they\nhad been a Brace of Thieves, and intimated every now and then that\nhe fear'd they would be benighted) and gave him the two Pieces of\nGold, he had but just receiv'd that Morning, as a Token of his\nGratitude for his courteous Entertainment. He added moreover, I\nwould willingly speak one Word with your Master before I go. The\nValet, thunder-struck at his unexpected Gratuity, comply'd with his\nRequest: Most hospitable Sir, said the Hermit, I couldn't go away\nwithout returning you my grateful Acknowledgments for the friendly\nReception we have met with this Afternoon. Be pleas'd to accept this\nGolden Bason as a small Token of my Gratitude and Esteem. The Miser\nstarted, and was ready to fall down backwards at the Sight of so\nvaluable a Present. The Hermit gave him no Time to recover out of\nhis Surprise, but march'd off that Moment with his young Comrade.\nFather, said _Zadig_, What is all this that I have seen? You seem to\nme to act in a quite different Manner from the Generality of\nMankind. You plunder One, who entertain'd you with all the Pomp and\nProfusion in the World, to enrich a covetous, sordid Wretch, who\ntreated you in the most unworthy Manner. Son, said the old Man, that\nGrandee, who receives Visits of Strangers, with no other View than\nto gratify his Pride, and to raise their Astonishment at the\nFurniture of his Palace, will henceforward learn to be wiser; and\nthe Miser to be more liberal for the Time to come. Don't be\nsurpris'd, but follow me. _Zadig_ was at a stand at present; and\ncouldn't well determine whether his Companion was a Man of greater\nWisdom than ordinary, or a Mad-man. But the Hermit assum'd such an\nAscendency over him, exclusive of the Oath he had taken, that he\ncouldn't tell how to leave him. At Night they came to a House very\ncommodiously built, but neat and plain; where nothing was wanting,\nand yet nothing profuse. The Master was a Philosopher, that had\nretir'd from the busy World, in order to live in Peace, and form his\nMind to Virtue. He was pleas'd to build this little Box for the\nReception of Strangers, in a handsome Manner, but without\nOstentation. He came in Person to meet them at the Door, and for a\nTime, advis'd them to sit down and rest themselves in a commodious\nApartment. After some Respite, he invited them to a frugal, yet\nelegant Repast; during which, he talk'd very intelligently about the\nlate Revolutions in _Babylon_. He seem'd entirely to be in the\nQueen's Interest, and heartily wish'd that _Zadig_ had entred the\nLists for the regal Prize: But _Babylon_, said he, don't deserve a\nKing of so much Merit. A modest Blush appear'd in _Zadig's_ Face at\nthis unexpected Compliment, which innocently aggravated his\nMisfortunes. It was agreed, on all Hands, that the Affairs of this\nWorld took sometimes a quite different Turn from what the wisest\nPatriots would wish them. The Hermit replied, the Ways of Providence\nare often very intricate and obscure, and Men were much to blame for\ncasting Reflections on the Conduct of the Whole, upon the bare\nInspection of the minutest Part.\nThe next Topick they entred upon was the Passions. Alas! said\n_Zadig_, how fatal in their Consequences! However, said the Hermit,\nthey are the Winds that swell the Sail of the Vessel. Sometimes,\n'tis true, they overset it; but there is no such Thing as sailing\nwithout them. Phlegm, indeed, makes Men peevish and sick; but then\nthere is no living without it. Tho' every Thing here below is\ndangerous, yet All are necessary.\nIn the next Place, their Discourse turn'd on sensual Pleasures; and\nthe Hermit demonstrated, that they were the Gifts of Heaven; for,\nsaid he, Man cannot bestow either Sensations or Ideas on himself; he\nreceives them all; his Pain and Pleasure, as well as his Being,\nproceed from a superior Cause.\n_Zadig_ stood astonish'd, to think how a Man that had committed such\nvile Actions, could argue so well on such Moral Topicks. At the\nproper Hour, after an Entertainment, not only instructive, but ev'ry\nway agreeable, their Host conducted them to their Bed-chamber,\nthanking Heaven for directing two such polite and virtuous Strangers\nto his House. He offer'd them at the same Time some Silver, to\ndefray their Expences on the Road; but with such an Air of Respect\nand Benevolence, that 'twas impossible to give the least Disgust.\nThe Hermit, however, refus'd it, and took his leave, as he propos'd\nto set forward for _Babylon_ by Break of Day. Their Parting was very\naffectionate and friendly; _Zadig_, in particular, express'd a more\nthan common Regard for a Man of so amiable a Behaviour. When the\nHermit and he were alone, and preparing for Bed, they talk'd long in\nPraise of their new Host. As soon as Day-light appear'd, the old\nHermit wak'd his young Comrade. 'Tis Time to be gone, said he; but\nas all the House are fast asleep, I'll leave a Token behind me of my\nRespect and Affection for the Master of it. No sooner were the Words\nout of his Mouth, but he struck a Light, kindled a Torch, and set\nthe Building in a Flame: _Zadig_, in the utmost Confusion, shriek'd\nout, and would, if possible, have prevented him from being guilty of\nsuch a monstrous Act of Ingratitude. The Hermit dragg'd him away, by\na superior Force. The House was soon in a Blaze: When they had got\nat a convenient Distance, the Hermit, with an amazing Sedateness,\nturn'd back and survey'd the destructive Flames. Behold, said he,\nour fortunate Friend! In the Ruins, he will find an immense\nTreasure, that will enable him, from henceforth, to exert his\nBeneficence, and render his Virtues more and more conspicuous.\n_Zadig_, tho' astonish'd to the last Degree, attended him to their\nlast Stage, which was to the Cottage of a very virtuous and\nwell-dispos'd Widow, who had a Nephew of about fourteen Years of\nAge. He was a hopeful Youth, and the Darling of her Heart. She\nentertain'd her two Guests with the best Provisions her little House\nafforded. In the Morning she order'd her Nephew to attend them to an\nadjacent Bridge, which, having been broken down some few Days\nbefore, render'd the Passage dangerous to Strangers.\nThe Lad, being very attentive to wait on them, went formost. When\nthey were got upon the Bridge; come hither, my pretty Boy, said the\nHermit, I must give your Aunt some small Token of my Respect for her\nlast Night's Favours. Upon that, he twisted his Fingers in the Hair\nof his Head, and threw him, very calmly, into the River. Down went\nthe little Lad; he came up once again to the Surface of the Water;\nbut was soon lost in the rapid Stream. O thou Monster! thou worst of\nVillains, cry'd _Zadig_! Didn't you promise, said the Hermit, to\nview my Conduct with Patience? Know then, that had that Boy liv'd\nbut one Year longer, he would have murder'd his Foster-Mother. Who\ntold you so, you barbarous Wretch, said _Zadig_? And when did you\nread that inhuman Event in your _Black-Book_ of _Fate_? Who gave you\nPermission pray, to drown so innocent a Youth, that had never\ndisoblig'd you?\nNo sooner had our young _Babylonian_ ceas'd his severe Reflections,\nbut he perceiv'd that the old Hermit's long Beard grew shorter and\nshorter; that the Furrows in his Face began to fill up, and that his\nCheeks glow'd with a Rose-coloured Red, as if he had been in the\nBloom of Fifteen. His Mantle was vanish'd at once; and on his\nShoulders, which were before cover'd, appear'd four angelic Wings,\neach refulgent as the Sun. O thou Messenger of Heaven! O thou\nangelic Form! cry'd _Zadig_, and fell prostrate at his Feet; thou\nart descended from the Empireum, I find, to instruct such a poor\nfrail Mortal as I am, how to submit to the Mysteries of Fate.\nMankind in general, said the Angel _Jesrad_, judge of the Whole, by\nonly viewing the hither Link of the Chain. Thou, of all the human\nRace, wast the only Man that deserv'd to have thy Mind enlighten'd.\n_Zadig_, begg'd Leave to speak. I am somewhat diffident of myself,\n'tis true; but may I presume, Sir, to beg the Solution of one\nScruple? Would it not have been better to have chastiz'd the Lad,\nand by that Means reform'd him, than to have cut him off thus\nunprepar'd in a Moment. _Jesrad_, replied, had he been virtuous, and\nhad he liv'd, 'twas his _Fate_ not only to be murder'd himself, but\nhis Wife, whom he would afterwards have married, and the little\nInfant, that was to have been the Pledge of their mutual Affection.\nIs it necessary then, venerable Guide, that there should be\nWickedness and Misfortunes in the World, and that those Misfortunes\nshould fall with Weight on the Heads of the Righteous? The Wicked,\nreplied _Jesrad_, are always unhappy. Misfortunes are intended only\nas a Touch-stone, to try a small Number of the Just, who are thinly\nscatter'd about this terrestrial Globe: Besides, there is no Evil\nunder the Sun, but some Good proceeds from it: But, said _Zadig_,\nSuppose the World was all Goodness, and there was no such Thing in\nNature as Evil. Then, that World of yours, said _Jesrad_, would be\nanother World; the Chain of Events would be another Wisdom; and that\nother Order, which would be perfect, must of Necessity be the\neverlasting Residence of the supreme Being, whom no Evil can\napproach. That great and first Cause has created an infinite Number\nof Worlds, and no two of them alike. This vast Variety is an\nAttribute of his Omnipotence. There are not two Leaves on the Trees\nthroughout the Universe, nor any two Globes of Light amongst the\nMyriad of Stars that deck the infinite Expanse of Heaven, which are\nperfectly alike. And whatever you see on that small Atom of Earth,\nwhereof you are a Native, must exist in the Place, and at the Time\nappointed, according to the immutable Decrees of him who comprehends\nthe Whole. Mankind imagine, that the Lad, whom I plung'd into the\nRiver, was drown'd by _Chance_; and that our generous Benefactor's\nHouse was reduc'd to Ashes by the same _Chance_; but know, there is\nno such Thing as _Chance_, all Misfortunes are intended, either as\nsevere Trials, Judgments, or Rewards; and are the Result of\nForeknowledge. You remember, Sir, the poor Fisherman in Despair,\nthat thought himself the most unhappy Mortal breathing. The great\n_Orasmades_, sent you to amend his Situation. Frail Mortal! Cease to\ncontend with what you ought to adore. But, said _Zadig_--whilst the\nSound of the Word But dwelt upon his Tongue, the Angel took his\nFlight towards the tenth Sphere. _Zadig_ sunk down upon his Knees,\nand acknowledg'd an over-ruling Providence with all the Marks of the\nprofoundest Submission. The Angel, as he was soaring towards the\nClouds, cried out in distinct Accents; Make thy Way towards\n_Babylon_.\nCHAP. XVIII.\n_The_ AENIGMAS, or RIDDLES.\n_Zadig_, as one beside himself, and perfectly thunder-struck, beat\nhis March at random. He entred, however, into the City of _Babylon_,\non that very Day, when those Combatants who had been before engag'd\nin the List or Circus, were already assembled in the spacious\nOuter-Court of the Palace, in order to solve the AEnigmas, and give\nthe wisest Answers they could to such Questions, as the _Grand\nMagus_ should propose. All the Parties concern'd were present,\nexcept the Knight of the Green Armour. No sooner had _Zadig_ made\nhis Appearance in the City, but the Populace flock'd round about\nhim: No Eye was satisfied with gazing at him: All in general were\nlavish of their Praises, and in their Hearts wish'd him their\nSovereign, except the envious Man, who as he pass'd by, fetch'd a\ndeep Sigh, and turn'd his Head aside. The Populace with loud\nAcclamations attended him to the Palace-Gate. The Queen, who had\nheard of his Arrival, was in the utmost Agony, between Hope and\nDespair. Her Vexation had almost brought her to Death's Door; she\ncouldn't conceive why _Zadig_ should appear without his\nAccoutrements, nor imagine which Way _Itobad_ could procure the\nsnow-white Armour. At the Sight of _Zadig_ a confus'd Murmur ran\nthro' the whole Place. Every Eye was surpriz'd, tho' charm'd at the\nsame Time to see him again: But then none were to be admitted into\nthe Assembly-Room except the Knights.\nI have fought as successfully as any one of them all, said _Zadig_,\ntho' another appears clad in my Armour; but in the mean Time, before\nI can possibly prove my Assertion, I insist upon being admitted into\nCourt, in order to give my Solutions to such AEnigmas as shall be\npropos'd. 'Twas put to the Vote. As the Reputation of his being a\nMan of the strictest Honour and Veracity was so strongly imprinted\non their Minds, the Motion of his Admittance was carried in the\nAffirmative, without the least Opposition.\nThe first Question the _Grand Magus_ propos'd was this: What is the\nlongest and yet the shortest Thing in the World; the most swift and\nthe most slow; the most divisible, and the most extended; the least\nvalu'd, and the most regretted; And without which nothing can\npossibly be done: Which, in a Word, devours every Thing how minute\nsoever, and yet gives Life and Spirit to every Object or Being,\nhowever Great?\n_Itobad_ had the Honour to answer first. His reply was, that a Man\nof his Merit had something else to think on, than idle Riddles;\n'twas enough for him, that he was acknowledg'd the Hero of the\nCircus. One said, the Solution of the AEnigma propos'd was _Fortune_;\nothers said the _Earth_; and others again the _Light_: But _Zadig_\npronounced it to be _Time_. Nothing, said he, can be longer, since\n'tis the Measure of Eternity; Nothing is shorter, since there is\nTime always wanting to accomplish what we aim at. Nothing passes so\nslowly as Time to him who is in Expectation; and nothing so swift as\nTime to him who is in the perfect Enjoyment of his Wishes. It's\nExtent is to Infinity, in the Whole; and divisible to Infinity in\npart. All Men neglect it in the Passage; and all regret the Loss of\nit when 'tis past. Nothing can possibly be done without it; it\nburies in Oblivion whatever is unworthy of being transmitted down to\nPosterity; and it renders all illustrious Actions immortal. The\nAssembly agreed unanimously that _Zadig_ was in the Right.\nThe next Question that was started, was, What is the Thing we\nreceive, without being ever thankful for it; which we enjoy, without\nknowing how we came by it; which we give away to others, without\nknowing where 'tis to be found; and which we lose, without being any\nways conscious of our Misfortune?\nEach pass'd his Verdict. _Zadig_ was the only Person that concluded\nit was LIFE. He solv'd every AEnigma propos'd, with equal Facility.\n_Itobad_, when he heard the Explications, always said that nothing\nin the World was more easy, than to solve such obvious Questions;\nand that he could interpret a thousand of them without the least\nHesitation, were he inclin'd to trouble his Head about such Trifles.\nOther Questions were propos'd in regard to Justice, the sovereign\nGood, and the Art of Government. _Zadig's_ Answers still carried the\ngreatest Weight. What Pity 'tis, said some who were present, that\none of so comprehensive a Genius, should make such a scurvy\nCavalier?\nMost illustrious Grandees, said _Zadig_, I was the Person that had\nthe Honour of being Victor at your Circus; the white Armour, most\npuissant Lords, was mine. That awkward Warrior there, Lord _Itobad_,\ndress'd himself in it whilst I was asleep. He imagin'd, it is plain,\nthat it would do him more Honour than his own Green one. Unaccoutred\nas I am, I am ready, before this august Assembly, to give them\nincontestable Proof of my superior Skill; to engage with the Usurper\nof the White Armour with my Sword only in my Mantle and Bonnet; and\nto testify that I only was the happy Victor of the justly admired\n_Hottam_.\n_Itobad_ accepted of the Challenge with all the Assurance of Success\nimaginable. He did not doubt, but being properly accoutred with his\nHelmet, his Cuirass, and his Bracelets, he should be able to hue\ndown an Antagonist, in his Mantle and Cap, and nothing to skreen him\nfrom his Resentment, but a single Sabre. _Zadig_ drew his Sword, and\nsaluted the Queen with it, who view'd him with Transport mix'd with\nFear. _Itobad_ drew his, but paid his Compliments to Nobody. He\napproach'd _Zadig_, as one, whom he imagin'd incapable of making any\nconsiderable Resistance. He concluded, 'twas in his Power to cut\n_Zadig_ into Atoms. _Zadig_, however, knew how to parry the Blow, by\ndexterously receiving it upon his _Fort_ (as the Swords-men call it)\nby which Means _Itobad's_ Sword was snapt in two. With that _Zadig_\nin an Instant clos'd his Adversary, and by his superior Strength, as\nwell as Skill, laid him sprawling on his Back. Then holding the\nPoint of his Sword to the opening of his Cuirass, Submit to be\nstripp'd of your borrow'd Plumes, or you are a dead Man this Moment.\n_Itobad_, always surpriz'd, that any Disappointment should attend a\nMan of such exalted Merit as himself, very tamely permitted _Zadig_\nto disrobe him by Degrees of his pompous Helmet, his superb Cuirass,\nhis rich Bracelets, his brilliant Cuisses, or Armour for his Thighs,\nand other Martial Accoutrements. When _Zadig_ had equipp'd himself\n_Cap-a-pee_, in his now recover'd Armour, he flew to _Astarte_, and\nthrew himself prostrate at her Feet. _Cador_ prov'd, without any\ngreat Difficulty, that the White Armour was _Zadig's_ Property. He\nwas thereupon acknowledg'd King of _Babylon_, by the unanimous\nContent of the Whole Court; but more particularly with the\nApprobation of _Astarte_, who after such a long Series of\nMisfortunes, now tasted the Sweets of seeing her darling _Zadig_\nthought worthy, in the Opinion of the whole World, to be the Partner\nof her royal Bed. _Itobad_ withdrew, and contented himself with\nbeing call'd _my Lord_ within the narrow Compass of his own\nDomesticks. _Zadig_, in short, was elected King, and was as happy as\nany Mortal could be.\nNow he began to reflect on what the Angel _Jesrad_ had said to him:\nNay, he reflected so far back as the Story of the _Arabian_ Atom of\nDust metamorphosed into a Diamond. The Queen and He ador'd the\nDivine Providence. _Zadig_ permitted _Missouf_, the Fair Coquet, to\nmake her Conquests where she could. He sent Couriers to bring the\nFree-booter _Arbogad_ to Court, and gave him an Honourable Military\nPost in his Army, with a farther Promise of Promotion to the highest\nDignity; but upon this express Condition, that he would act for the\nfuture as a Soldier of Honour; but assur'd him at the same Time,\nthat he'd make a publick Example of him, if he follow'd his\nProfession of Free-booting for the future.\n_Setoc_ was sent for from the lonely Desarts of _Arabia_, together\nwith the fair _Almonza_, his new Bride, to preside over the\ncommercial Affairs of _Babylon_. _Cador_ was advanc'd to a Post near\nhimself, and was his Favourite Minister at Court, as the just Reward\nof his past Services. He was, in short, the King's real Friend; and\n_Zadig_ was the only Monarch in the Universe that could boast of\nsuch an Attendant. The Dwarf, tho' dumb, was not wholly forgotten.\nThe Fisherman was put into the Possession of a very handsome House;\nand _Orcan_ was sentenc'd, not only to pay him a very considerable\nSum for the Injustice done him in detaining his Wife; but to resign\nher likewise to the proper Owner: The Fisherman, however, grown wise\nby Experience, soften'd the Rigour of the Sentence, and took the\nMoney only in full of all Accounts.\nHe didn't leave so much as _Semira_ wholly disconsolate, tho' she\nhad such an Aversion to a blind Eye; nor _Azora_ comfortless,\nnotwithstanding her affectionate Intention to shorten his Nose; for\nhe sooth'd their Sorrows by very munificent Presents. The envious\nInformer indeed, died with Shame and Vexation. The Empire was\nglorious abroad, and in the full Enjoyment of Tranquility, Peace and\nPlenty, at home: This, in short, was the true golden Age. The whole\nCountry was sway'd by Love and Justice.

{"text": "HOW CANDIDE WAS BROUGHT UP IN A MAGNIFICENT CASTLE, AND HOW HE WAS\nEXPELLED THENCE.\nIn a castle of Westphalia, belonging to the Baron of\nThunder-ten-Tronckh, lived a youth, whom nature had endowed with the\nmost gentle manners. His countenance was a true picture of his soul. He\ncombined a true judgment with simplicity of spirit, which was the\nreason, I apprehend, of his being called Candide. The old servants of\nthe family suspected him to have been the son of the Baron's sister, by\na good, honest gentleman of the neighborhood, whom that young lady would\nnever marry because he had been able to prove only seventy-one\nquarterings, the rest of his genealogical tree having been lost through\nthe injuries of time.\nThe Baron was one of the most powerful lords in Westphalia, for his\ncastle had not only a gate, but windows. His great hall, even, was hung\nwith tapestry. All the dogs of his farm-yards formed a pack of hounds at\nneed; his grooms were his huntsmen; and the curate of the village was\nhis grand almoner. They called him \"My Lord,\" and laughed at all his\nstories.\nThe Baron's lady weighed about three hundred and fifty pounds, and was\ntherefore a person of great consideration, and she did the honours of\nthe house with a dignity that commanded still greater respect. Her\ndaughter Cunegonde was seventeen years of age, fresh-coloured, comely,\nplump, and desirable. The Baron's son seemed to be in every respect\nworthy of his father. The Preceptor Pangloss[1] was the oracle of the\nfamily, and little Candide heard his lessons with all the good faith of\nhis age and character.\nPangloss was professor of metaphysico-theologico-cosmolo-nigology. He\nproved admirably that there is no effect without a cause, and that, in\nthis best of all possible worlds, the Baron's castle was the most\nmagnificent of castles, and his lady the best of all possible\nBaronesses.\n\"It is demonstrable,\" said he, \"that things cannot be otherwise than as\nthey are; for all being created for an end, all is necessarily for the\nbest end. Observe, that the nose has been formed to bear\nspectacles--thus we have spectacles. Legs are visibly designed for\nstockings--and we have stockings. Stones were made to be hewn, and to\nconstruct castles--therefore my lord has a magnificent castle; for the\ngreatest baron in the province ought to be the best lodged. Pigs were\nmade to be eaten--therefore we eat pork all the year round. Consequently\nthey who assert that all is well have said a foolish thing, they should\nhave said all is for the best.\"\nCandide listened attentively and believed innocently; for he thought\nMiss Cunegonde extremely beautiful, though he never had the courage to\ntell her so. He concluded that after the happiness of being born of\nBaron of Thunder-ten-Tronckh, the second degree of happiness was to be\nMiss Cunegonde, the third that of seeing her every day, and the fourth\nthat of hearing Master Pangloss, the greatest philosopher of the whole\nprovince, and consequently of the whole world.\nOne day Cunegonde, while walking near the castle, in a little wood which\nthey called a park, saw between the bushes, Dr. Pangloss giving a lesson\nin experimental natural philosophy to her mother's chamber-maid, a\nlittle brown wench, very pretty and very docile. As Miss Cunegonde had a\ngreat disposition for the sciences, she breathlessly observed the\nrepeated experiments of which she was a witness; she clearly perceived\nthe force of the Doctor's reasons, the effects, and the causes; she\nturned back greatly flurried, quite pensive, and filled with the desire\nto be learned; dreaming that she might well be a _sufficient reason_ for\nyoung Candide, and he for her.\nShe met Candide on reaching the castle and blushed; Candide blushed\nalso; she wished him good morrow in a faltering tone, and Candide spoke\nto her without knowing what he said. The next day after dinner, as they\nwent from table, Cunegonde and Candide found themselves behind a screen;\nCunegonde let fall her handkerchief, Candide picked it up, she took him\ninnocently by the hand, the youth as innocently kissed the young lady's\nhand with particular vivacity, sensibility, and grace; their lips met,\ntheir eyes sparkled, their knees trembled, their hands strayed. Baron\nThunder-ten-Tronckh passed near the screen and beholding this cause and\neffect chased Candide from the castle with great kicks on the backside;\nCunegonde fainted away; she was boxed on the ears by the Baroness, as\nsoon as she came to herself; and all was consternation in this most\nmagnificent and most agreeable of all possible castles.\nII\nWHAT BECAME OF CANDIDE AMONG THE BULGARIANS.\nCandide, driven from terrestrial paradise, walked a long while without\nknowing where, weeping, raising his eyes to heaven, turning them often\ntowards the most magnificent of castles which imprisoned the purest of\nnoble young ladies. He lay down to sleep without supper, in the middle\nof a field between two furrows. The snow fell in large flakes. Next day\nCandide, all benumbed, dragged himself towards the neighbouring town\nwhich was called Waldberghofftrarbk-dikdorff, having no money, dying of\nhunger and fatigue, he stopped sorrowfully at the door of an inn. Two\nmen dressed in blue observed him.\n\"Comrade,\" said one, \"here is a well-built young fellow, and of proper\nheight.\"\nThey went up to Candide and very civilly invited him to dinner.\n\"Gentlemen,\" replied Candide, with a most engaging modesty, \"you do me\ngreat honour, but I have not wherewithal to pay my share.\"\n\"Oh, sir,\" said one of the blues to him, \"people of your appearance and\nof your merit never pay anything: are you not five feet five inches\nhigh?\"\n\"Yes, sir, that is my height,\" answered he, making a low bow.\n\"Come, sir, seat yourself; not only will we pay your reckoning, but we\nwill never suffer such a man as you to want money; men are only born to\nassist one another.\"\n\"You are right,\" said Candide; \"this is what I was always taught by Mr.\nPangloss, and I see plainly that all is for the best.\"\nThey begged of him to accept a few crowns. He took them, and wished to\ngive them his note; they refused; they seated themselves at table.\n\"Love you not deeply?\"\n\"Oh yes,\" answered he; \"I deeply love Miss Cunegonde.\"\n\"No,\" said one of the gentlemen, \"we ask you if you do not deeply love\nthe King of the Bulgarians?\"\n\"Not at all,\" said he; \"for I have never seen him.\"\n\"What! he is the best of kings, and we must drink his health.\"\n\"Oh! very willingly, gentlemen,\" and he drank.\n\"That is enough,\" they tell him. \"Now you are the help, the support,\nthe defender, the hero of the Bulgarians. Your fortune is made, and your\nglory is assured.\"\nInstantly they fettered him, and carried him away to the regiment. There\nhe was made to wheel about to the right, and to the left, to draw his\nrammer, to return his rammer, to present, to fire, to march, and they\ngave him thirty blows with a cudgel. The next day he did his exercise a\nlittle less badly, and he received but twenty blows. The day following\nthey gave him only ten, and he was regarded by his comrades as a\nprodigy.\nCandide, all stupefied, could not yet very well realise how he was a\nhero. He resolved one fine day in spring to go for a walk, marching\nstraight before him, believing that it was a privilege of the human as\nwell as of the animal species to make use of their legs as they pleased.\nHe had advanced two leagues when he was overtaken by four others, heroes\nof six feet, who bound him and carried him to a dungeon. He was asked\nwhich he would like the best, to be whipped six-and-thirty times through\nall the regiment, or to receive at once twelve balls of lead in his\nbrain. He vainly said that human will is free, and that he chose neither\nthe one nor the other. He was forced to make a choice; he determined, in\nvirtue of that gift of God called liberty, to run the gauntlet\nsix-and-thirty times. He bore this twice. The regiment was composed of\ntwo thousand men; that composed for him four thousand strokes, which\nlaid bare all his muscles and nerves, from the nape of his neck quite\ndown to his rump. As they were going to proceed to a third whipping,\nCandide, able to bear no more, begged as a favour that they would be so\ngood as to shoot him. He obtained this favour; they bandaged his eyes,\nand bade him kneel down. The King of the Bulgarians passed at this\nmoment and ascertained the nature of the crime. As he had great talent,\nhe understood from all that he learnt of Candide that he was a young\nmetaphysician, extremely ignorant of the things of this world, and he\naccorded him his pardon with a clemency which will bring him praise in\nall the journals, and throughout all ages.\nAn able surgeon cured Candide in three weeks by means of emollients\ntaught by Dioscorides. He had already a little skin, and was able to\nmarch when the King of the Bulgarians gave battle to the King of the\nAbares.[2]\nIII\nHOW CANDIDE MADE HIS ESCAPE FROM THE BULGARIANS, AND WHAT AFTERWARDS\nBECAME OF HIM.\nThere was never anything so gallant, so spruce, so brilliant, and so\nwell disposed as the two armies. Trumpets, fifes, hautboys, drums, and\ncannon made music such as Hell itself had never heard. The cannons first\nof all laid flat about six thousand men on each side; the muskets swept\naway from this best of worlds nine or ten thousand ruffians who infested\nits surface. The bayonet was also a _sufficient reason_ for the death of\nseveral thousands. The whole might amount to thirty thousand souls.\nCandide, who trembled like a philosopher, hid himself as well as he\ncould during this heroic butchery.\nAt length, while the two kings were causing Te Deum to be sung each in\nhis own camp, Candide resolved to go and reason elsewhere on effects and\ncauses. He passed over heaps of dead and dying, and first reached a\nneighbouring village; it was in cinders, it was an Abare village which\nthe Bulgarians had burnt according to the laws of war. Here, old men\ncovered with wounds, beheld their wives, hugging their children to their\nbloody breasts, massacred before their faces; there, their daughters,\ndisembowelled and breathing their last after having satisfied the\nnatural wants of Bulgarian heroes; while others, half burnt in the\nflames, begged to be despatched. The earth was strewed with brains,\narms, and legs.\nCandide fled quickly to another village; it belonged to the Bulgarians;\nand the Abarian heroes had treated it in the same way. Candide, walking\nalways over palpitating limbs or across ruins, arrived at last beyond\nthe seat of war, with a few provisions in his knapsack, and Miss\nCunegonde always in his heart. His provisions failed him when he arrived\nin Holland; but having heard that everybody was rich in that country,\nand that they were Christians, he did not doubt but he should meet with\nthe same treatment from them as he had met with in the Baron's castle,\nbefore Miss Cunegonde's bright eyes were the cause of his expulsion\nthence.\nHe asked alms of several grave-looking people, who all answered him,\nthat if he continued to follow this trade they would confine him to the\nhouse of correction, where he should be taught to get a living.\nThe next he addressed was a man who had been haranguing a large assembly\nfor a whole hour on the subject of charity. But the orator, looking\naskew, said:\n\"What are you doing here? Are you for the good cause?\"\n\"There can be no effect without a cause,\" modestly answered Candide;\n\"the whole is necessarily concatenated and arranged for the best. It was\nnecessary for me to have been banished from the presence of Miss\nCunegonde, to have afterwards run the gauntlet, and now it is necessary\nI should beg my bread until I learn to earn it; all this cannot be\notherwise.\"\n\"My friend,\" said the orator to him, \"do you believe the Pope to be\nAnti-Christ?\"\n\"I have not heard it,\" answered Candide; \"but whether he be, or whether\nhe be not, I want bread.\"\n\"Thou dost not deserve to eat,\" said the other. \"Begone, rogue; begone,\nwretch; do not come near me again.\"\nThe orator's wife, putting her head out of the window, and spying a man\nthat doubted whether the Pope was Anti-Christ, poured over him a\nfull.... Oh, heavens! to what excess does religious zeal carry the\nladies.\nA man who had never been christened, a good Anabaptist, named James,\nbeheld the cruel and ignominious treatment shown to one of his\nbrethren, an unfeathered biped with a rational soul, he took him home,\ncleaned him, gave him bread and beer, presented him with two florins,\nand even wished to teach him the manufacture of Persian stuffs which\nthey make in Holland. Candide, almost prostrating himself before him,\ncried:\n\"Master Pangloss has well said that all is for the best in this world,\nfor I am infinitely more touched by your extreme generosity than with\nthe inhumanity of that gentleman in the black coat and his lady.\"\nThe next day, as he took a walk, he met a beggar all covered with scabs,\nhis eyes diseased, the end of his nose eaten away, his mouth distorted,\nhis teeth black, choking in his throat, tormented with a violent cough,\nand spitting out a tooth at each effort.\nIV\nHOW CANDIDE FOUND HIS OLD MASTER PANGLOSS, AND WHAT HAPPENED TO THEM.\nCandide, yet more moved with compassion than with horror, gave to this\nshocking beggar the two florins which he had received from the honest\nAnabaptist James. The spectre looked at him very earnestly, dropped a\nfew tears, and fell upon his neck. Candide recoiled in disgust.\n\"Alas!\" said one wretch to the other, \"do you no longer know your dear\nPangloss?\"\n\"What do I hear? You, my dear master! you in this terrible plight! What\nmisfortune has happened to you? Why are you no longer in the most\nmagnificent of castles? What has become of Miss Cunegonde, the pearl of\ngirls, and nature's masterpiece?\"\n\"I am so weak that I cannot stand,\" said Pangloss.\nUpon which Candide carried him to the Anabaptist's stable, and gave him\na crust of bread. As soon as Pangloss had refreshed himself a little:\n\"Well,\" said Candide, \"Cunegonde?\"\n\"She is dead,\" replied the other.\nCandide fainted at this word; his friend recalled his senses with a\nlittle bad vinegar which he found by chance in the stable. Candide\nreopened his eyes.\n\"Cunegonde is dead! Ah, best of worlds, where art thou? But of what\nillness did she die? Was it not for grief, upon seeing her father kick\nme out of his magnificent castle?\"\n\"No,\" said Pangloss, \"she was ripped open by the Bulgarian soldiers,\nafter having been violated by many; they broke the Baron's head for\nattempting to defend her; my lady, her mother, was cut in pieces; my\npoor pupil was served just in the same manner as his sister; and as for\nthe castle, they have not left one stone upon another, not a barn, nor a\nsheep, nor a duck, nor a tree; but we have had our revenge, for the\nAbares have done the very same thing to a neighbouring barony, which\nbelonged to a Bulgarian lord.\"\nAt this discourse Candide fainted again; but coming to himself, and\nhaving said all that it became him to say, inquired into the cause and\neffect, as well as into the _sufficient reason_ that had reduced\nPangloss to so miserable a plight.\n\"Alas!\" said the other, \"it was love; love, the comfort of the human\nspecies, the preserver of the universe, the soul of all sensible beings,\nlove, tender love.\"\n\"Alas!\" said Candide, \"I know this love, that sovereign of hearts, that\nsoul of our souls; yet it never cost me more than a kiss and twenty\nkicks on the backside. How could this beautiful cause produce in you an\neffect so abominable?\"\nPangloss made answer in these terms: \"Oh, my dear Candide, you remember\nPaquette, that pretty wench who waited on our noble Baroness; in her\narms I tasted the delights of paradise, which produced in me those hell\ntorments with which you see me devoured; she was infected with them, she\nis perhaps dead of them. This present Paquette received of a learned\nGrey Friar, who had traced it to its source; he had had it of an old\ncountess, who had received it from a cavalry captain, who owed it to a\nmarchioness, who took it from a page, who had received it from a Jesuit,\nwho when a novice had it in a direct line from one of the companions of\nChristopher Columbus.[3] For my part I shall give it to nobody, I am\ndying.\"\n\"Oh, Pangloss!\" cried Candide, \"what a strange genealogy! Is not the\nDevil the original stock of it?\"\n\"Not at all,\" replied this great man, \"it was a thing unavoidable, a\nnecessary ingredient in the best of worlds; for if Columbus had not in\nan island of America caught this disease, which contaminates the source\nof life, frequently even hinders generation, and which is evidently\nopposed to the great end of nature, we should have neither chocolate nor\ncochineal. We are also to observe that upon our continent, this\ndistemper is like religious controversy, confined to a particular spot.\nThe Turks, the Indians, the Persians, the Chinese, the Siamese, the\nJapanese, know nothing of it; but there is a sufficient reason for\nbelieving that they will know it in their turn in a few centuries. In\nthe meantime, it has made marvellous progress among us, especially in\nthose great armies composed of honest well-disciplined hirelings, who\ndecide the destiny of states; for we may safely affirm that when an army\nof thirty thousand men fights another of an equal number, there are\nabout twenty thousand of them p-x-d on each side.\"\n\"Well, this is wonderful!\" said Candide, \"but you must get cured.\"\n\"Alas! how can I?\" said Pangloss, \"I have not a farthing, my friend, and\nall over the globe there is no letting of blood or taking a glister,\nwithout paying, or somebody paying for you.\"\nThese last words determined Candide; he went and flung himself at the\nfeet of the charitable Anabaptist James, and gave him so touching a\npicture of the state to which his friend was reduced, that the good man\ndid not scruple to take Dr. Pangloss into his house, and had him cured\nat his expense. In the cure Pangloss lost only an eye and an ear. He\nwrote well, and knew arithmetic perfectly. The Anabaptist James made him\nhis bookkeeper. At the end of two months, being obliged to go to Lisbon\nabout some mercantile affairs, he took the two philosophers with him in\nhis ship. Pangloss explained to him how everything was so constituted\nthat it could not be better. James was not of this opinion.\n\"It is more likely,\" said he, \"mankind have a little corrupted nature,\nfor they were not born wolves, and they have become wolves; God has\ngiven them neither cannon of four-and-twenty pounders, nor bayonets; and\nyet they have made cannon and bayonets to destroy one another. Into this\naccount I might throw not only bankrupts, but Justice which seizes on\nthe effects of bankrupts to cheat the creditors.\"\n\"All this was indispensable,\" replied the one-eyed doctor, \"for private\nmisfortunes make the general good, so that the more private misfortunes\nthere are the greater is the general good.\"\nWhile he reasoned, the sky darkened, the winds blew from the four\nquarters, and the ship was assailed by a most terrible tempest within\nsight of the port of Lisbon.\nV\nTEMPEST, SHIPWRECK, EARTHQUAKE, AND WHAT BECAME OF DOCTOR PANGLOSS,\nCANDIDE, AND JAMES THE ANABAPTIST.\nHalf dead of that inconceivable anguish which the rolling of a ship\nproduces, one-half of the passengers were not even sensible of the\ndanger. The other half shrieked and prayed. The sheets were rent, the\nmasts broken, the vessel gaped. Work who would, no one heard, no one\ncommanded. The Anabaptist being upon deck bore a hand; when a brutish\nsailor struck him roughly and laid him sprawling; but with the violence\nof the blow he himself tumbled head foremost overboard, and stuck upon a\npiece of the broken mast. Honest James ran to his assistance, hauled him\nup, and from the effort he made was precipitated into the sea in sight\nof the sailor, who left him to perish, without deigning to look at him.\nCandide drew near and saw his benefactor, who rose above the water one\nmoment and was then swallowed up for ever. He was just going to jump\nafter him, but was prevented by the philosopher Pangloss, who\ndemonstrated to him that the Bay of Lisbon had been made on purpose for\nthe Anabaptist to be drowned. While he was proving this _\u00e0 priori_, the\nship foundered; all perished except Pangloss, Candide, and that brutal\nsailor who had drowned the good Anabaptist. The villain swam safely to\nthe shore, while Pangloss and Candide were borne thither upon a plank.\nAs soon as they recovered themselves a little they walked toward Lisbon.\nThey had some money left, with which they hoped to save themselves from\nstarving, after they had escaped drowning. Scarcely had they reached the\ncity, lamenting the death of their benefactor, when they felt the earth\ntremble under their feet. The sea swelled and foamed in the harbour, and\nbeat to pieces the vessels riding at anchor. Whirlwinds of fire and\nashes covered the streets and public places; houses fell, roofs were\nflung upon the pavements, and the pavements were scattered. Thirty\nthousand inhabitants of all ages and sexes were crushed under the\nruins.[4] The sailor, whistling and swearing, said there was booty to be\ngained here.\n\"What can be the _sufficient reason_ of this phenomenon?\" said Pangloss.\n\"This is the Last Day!\" cried Candide.\nThe sailor ran among the ruins, facing death to find money; finding it,\nhe took it, got drunk, and having slept himself sober, purchased the\nfavours of the first good-natured wench whom he met on the ruins of the\ndestroyed houses, and in the midst of the dying and the dead. Pangloss\npulled him by the sleeve.\n\"My friend,\" said he, \"this is not right. You sin against the _universal\nreason_; you choose your time badly.\"\n\"S'blood and fury!\" answered the other; \"I am a sailor and born at\nBatavia. Four times have I trampled upon the crucifix in four voyages to\nJapan[5]; a fig for thy universal reason.\"\nSome falling stones had wounded Candide. He lay stretched in the street\ncovered with rubbish.\n\"Alas!\" said he to Pangloss, \"get me a little wine and oil; I am dying.\"\n\"This concussion of the earth is no new thing,\" answered Pangloss. \"The\ncity of Lima, in America, experienced the same convulsions last year;\nthe same cause, the same effects; there is certainly a train of sulphur\nunder ground from Lima to Lisbon.\"\n\"Nothing more probable,\" said Candide; \"but for the love of God a little\noil and wine.\"\n\"How, probable?\" replied the philosopher. \"I maintain that the point is\ncapable of being demonstrated.\"\nCandide fainted away, and Pangloss fetched him some water from a\nneighbouring fountain. The following day they rummaged among the ruins\nand found provisions, with which they repaired their exhausted strength.\nAfter this they joined with others in relieving those inhabitants who\nhad escaped death. Some, whom they had succoured, gave them as good a\ndinner as they could in such disastrous circumstances; true, the repast\nwas mournful, and the company moistened their bread with tears; but\nPangloss consoled them, assuring them that things could not be\notherwise.\n\"For,\" said he, \"all that is is for the best. If there is a volcano at\nLisbon it cannot be elsewhere. It is impossible that things should be\nother than they are; for everything is right.\"\nA little man dressed in black, Familiar of the Inquisition, who sat by\nhim, politely took up his word and said:\n\"Apparently, then, sir, you do not believe in original sin; for if all\nis for the best there has then been neither Fall nor punishment.\"\n\"I humbly ask your Excellency's pardon,\" answered Pangloss, still more\npolitely; \"for the Fall and curse of man necessarily entered into the\nsystem of the best of worlds.\"\n\"Sir,\" said the Familiar, \"you do not then believe in liberty?\"\n\"Your Excellency will excuse me,\" said Pangloss; \"liberty is consistent\nwith absolute necessity, for it was necessary we should be free; for, in\nshort, the determinate will----\"\nPangloss was in the middle of his sentence, when the Familiar beckoned\nto his footman, who gave him a glass of wine from Porto or Opporto.\nVI\nHOW THE PORTUGUESE MADE A BEAUTIFUL AUTO-DA-F\u00c9, TO PREVENT ANY FURTHER\nEARTHQUAKES; AND HOW CANDIDE WAS PUBLICLY WHIPPED.\nAfter the earthquake had destroyed three-fourths of Lisbon, the sages of\nthat country could think of no means more effectual to prevent utter\nruin than to give the people a beautiful _auto-da-f\u00e9_[6]; for it had\nbeen decided by the University of Coimbra, that the burning of a few\npeople alive by a slow fire, and with great ceremony, is an infallible\nsecret to hinder the earth from quaking.\nIn consequence hereof, they had seized on a Biscayner, convicted of\nhaving married his godmother, and on two Portuguese, for rejecting the\nbacon which larded a chicken they were eating[7]; after dinner, they\ncame and secured Dr. Pangloss, and his disciple Candide, the one for\nspeaking his mind, the other for having listened with an air of\napprobation. They were conducted to separate apartments, extremely cold,\nas they were never incommoded by the sun. Eight days after they were\ndressed in _san-benitos_[8] and their heads ornamented with paper\nmitres. The mitre and _san-benito_ belonging to Candide were painted\nwith reversed flames and with devils that had neither tails nor claws;\nbut Pangloss's devils had claws and tails and the flames were upright.\nThey marched in procession thus habited and heard a very pathetic\nsermon, followed by fine church music. Candide was whipped in cadence\nwhile they were singing; the Biscayner, and the two men who had refused\nto eat bacon, were burnt; and Pangloss was hanged, though that was not\nthe custom. The same day the earth sustained a most violent concussion.\nCandide, terrified, amazed, desperate, all bloody, all palpitating, said\nto himself:\n\"If this is the best of possible worlds, what then are the others? Well,\nif I had been only whipped I could put up with it, for I experienced\nthat among the Bulgarians; but oh, my dear Pangloss! thou greatest of\nphilosophers, that I should have seen you hanged, without knowing for\nwhat! Oh, my dear Anabaptist, thou best of men, that thou should'st have\nbeen drowned in the very harbour! Oh, Miss Cunegonde, thou pearl of\ngirls! that thou should'st have had thy belly ripped open!\"\nThus he was musing, scarce able to stand, preached at, whipped,\nabsolved, and blessed, when an old woman accosted him saying:\n\"My son, take courage and follow me.\"\nVII\nHOW THE OLD WOMAN TOOK CARE OF CANDIDE, AND HOW HE FOUND THE OBJECT HE\nLOVED.\nCandide did not take courage, but followed the old woman to a decayed\nhouse, where she gave him a pot of pomatum to anoint his sores, showed\nhim a very neat little bed, with a suit of clothes hanging up, and left\nhim something to eat and drink.\n\"Eat, drink, sleep,\" said she, \"and may our lady of Atocha,[9] the great\nSt. Anthony of Padua, and the great St. James of Compostella, receive\nyou under their protection. I shall be back to-morrow.\"\nCandide, amazed at all he had suffered and still more with the charity\nof the old woman, wished to kiss her hand.\n\"It is not my hand you must kiss,\" said the old woman; \"I shall be back\nto-morrow. Anoint yourself with the pomatum, eat and sleep.\"\nCandide, notwithstanding so many disasters, ate and slept. The next\nmorning the old woman brought him his breakfast, looked at his back, and\nrubbed it herself with another ointment: in like manner she brought him\nhis dinner; and at night she returned with his supper. The day following\nshe went through the very same ceremonies.\n\"Who are you?\" said Candide; \"who has inspired you with so much\ngoodness? What return can I make you?\"\nThe good woman made no answer; she returned in the evening, but brought\nno supper.\n\"Come with me,\" she said, \"and say nothing.\"\nShe took him by the arm, and walked with him about a quarter of a mile\ninto the country; they arrived at a lonely house, surrounded with\ngardens and canals. The old woman knocked at a little door, it opened,\nshe led Candide up a private staircase into a small apartment richly\nfurnished. She left him on a brocaded sofa, shut the door and went away.\nCandide thought himself in a dream; indeed, that he had been dreaming\nunluckily all his life, and that the present moment was the only\nagreeable part of it all.\nThe old woman returned very soon, supporting with difficulty a trembling\nwoman of a majestic figure, brilliant with jewels, and covered with a\nveil.\n\"Take off that veil,\" said the old woman to Candide.\nThe young man approaches, he raises the veil with a timid hand. Oh!\nwhat a moment! what surprise! he believes he beholds Miss Cunegonde? he\nreally sees her! it is herself! His strength fails him, he cannot utter\na word, but drops at her feet. Cunegonde falls upon the sofa. The old\nwoman supplies a smelling bottle; they come to themselves and recover\ntheir speech. As they began with broken accents, with questions and\nanswers interchangeably interrupted with sighs, with tears, and cries.\nThe old woman desired they would make less noise and then she left them\nto themselves.\n\"What, is it you?\" said Candide, \"you live? I find you again in\nPortugal? then you have not been ravished? then they did not rip open\nyour belly as Doctor Pangloss informed me?\"\n\"Yes, they did,\" said the beautiful Cunegonde; \"but those two accidents\nare not always mortal.\"\n\"But were your father and mother killed?\"\n\"It is but too true,\" answered Cunegonde, in tears.\n\"And your brother?\"\n\"My brother also was killed.\"\n\"And why are you in Portugal? and how did you know of my being here? and\nby what strange adventure did you contrive to bring me to this house?\"\n\"I will tell you all that,\" replied the lady, \"but first of all let me\nknow your history, since the innocent kiss you gave me and the kicks\nwhich you received.\"\nCandide respectfully obeyed her, and though he was still in a surprise,\nthough his voice was feeble and trembling, though his back still pained\nhim, yet he gave her a most ingenuous account of everything that had\nbefallen him since the moment of their separation. Cunegonde lifted up\nher eyes to heaven; shed tears upon hearing of the death of the good\nAnabaptist and of Pangloss; after which she spoke as follows to Candide,\nwho did not lose a word and devoured her with his eyes.\nVIII\nTHE HISTORY OF CUNEGONDE.\n\"I was in bed and fast asleep when it pleased God to send the Bulgarians\nto our delightful castle of Thunder-ten-Tronckh; they slew my father and\nbrother, and cut my mother in pieces. A tall Bulgarian, six feet high,\nperceiving that I had fainted away at this sight, began to ravish me;\nthis made me recover; I regained my senses, I cried, I struggled, I bit,\nI scratched, I wanted to tear out the tall Bulgarian's eyes--not knowing\nthat what happened at my father's house was the usual practice of war.\nThe brute gave me a cut in the left side with his hanger, and the mark\nis still upon me.\"\n\"Ah! I hope I shall see it,\" said honest Candide.\n\"You shall,\" said Cunegonde, \"but let us continue.\"\n\"Do so,\" replied Candide.\nThus she resumed the thread of her story:\n\"A Bulgarian captain came in, saw me all bleeding, and the soldier not\nin the least disconcerted. The captain flew into a passion at the\ndisrespectful behaviour of the brute, and slew him on my body. He\nordered my wounds to be dressed, and took me to his quarters as a\nprisoner of war. I washed the few shirts that he had, I did his cooking;\nhe thought me very pretty--he avowed it; on the other hand, I must own\nhe had a good shape, and a soft and white skin; but he had little or no\nmind or philosophy, and you might see plainly that he had never been\ninstructed by Doctor Pangloss. In three months time, having lost all his\nmoney, and being grown tired of my company, he sold me to a Jew, named\nDon Issachar, who traded to Holland and Portugal, and had a strong\npassion for women. This Jew was much attached to my person, but could\nnot triumph over it; I resisted him better than the Bulgarian soldier. A\nmodest woman may be ravished once, but her virtue is strengthened by it.\nIn order to render me more tractable, he brought me to this country\nhouse. Hitherto I had imagined that nothing could equal the beauty of\nThunder-ten-Tronckh Castle; but I found I was mistaken.\n\"The Grand Inquisitor, seeing me one day at Mass, stared long at me, and\nsent to tell me that he wished to speak on private matters. I was\nconducted to his palace, where I acquainted him with the history of my\nfamily, and he represented to me how much it was beneath my rank to\nbelong to an Israelite. A proposal was then made to Don Issachar that he\nshould resign me to my lord. Don Issachar, being the court banker, and a\nman of credit, would hear nothing of it. The Inquisitor threatened him\nwith an _auto-da-f\u00e9_. At last my Jew, intimidated, concluded a bargain,\nby which the house and myself should belong to both in common; the Jew\nshould have for himself Monday, Wednesday, and Saturday, and the\nInquisitor should have the rest of the week. It is now six months since\nthis agreement was made. Quarrels have not been wanting, for they could\nnot decide whether the night from Saturday to Sunday belonged to the old\nlaw or to the new. For my part, I have so far held out against both, and\nI verily believe that this is the reason why I am still beloved.\n\"At length, to avert the scourge of earthquakes, and to intimidate Don\nIssachar, my Lord Inquisitor was pleased to celebrate an _auto-da-f\u00e9_.\nHe did me the honour to invite me to the ceremony. I had a very good\nseat, and the ladies were served with refreshments between Mass and the\nexecution. I was in truth seized with horror at the burning of those two\nJews, and of the honest Biscayner who had married his godmother; but\nwhat was my surprise, my fright, my trouble, when I saw in a\n_san-benito_ and mitre a figure which resembled that of Pangloss! I\nrubbed my eyes, I looked at him attentively, I saw him hung; I fainted.\nScarcely had I recovered my senses than I saw you stripped, stark naked,\nand this was the height of my horror, consternation, grief, and despair.\nI tell you, truthfully, that your skin is yet whiter and of a more\nperfect colour than that of my Bulgarian captain. This spectacle\nredoubled all the feelings which overwhelmed and devoured me. I screamed\nout, and would have said, 'Stop, barbarians!' but my voice failed me,\nand my cries would have been useless after you had been severely\nwhipped. How is it possible, said I, that the beloved Candide and the\nwise Pangloss should both be at Lisbon, the one to receive a hundred\nlashes, and the other to be hanged by the Grand Inquisitor, of whom I am\nthe well-beloved? Pangloss most cruelly deceived me when he said that\neverything in the world is for the best.\n\"Agitated, lost, sometimes beside myself, and sometimes ready to die of\nweakness, my mind was filled with the massacre of my father, mother, and\nbrother, with the insolence of the ugly Bulgarian soldier, with the stab\nthat he gave me, with my servitude under the Bulgarian captain, with my\nhideous Don Issachar, with my abominable Inquisitor, with the execution\nof Doctor Pangloss, with the grand Miserere to which they whipped you,\nand especially with the kiss I gave you behind the screen the day that I\nhad last seen you. I praised God for bringing you back to me after so\nmany trials, and I charged my old woman to take care of you, and to\nconduct you hither as soon as possible. She has executed her commission\nperfectly well; I have tasted the inexpressible pleasure of seeing you\nagain, of hearing you, of speaking with you. But you must be hungry, for\nmyself, I am famished; let us have supper.\"\nThey both sat down to table, and, when supper was over, they placed\nthemselves once more on the sofa; where they were when Signor Don\nIssachar arrived. It was the Jewish Sabbath, and Issachar had come to\nenjoy his rights, and to explain his tender love.\nIX\nWHAT BECAME OF CUNEGONDE, CANDIDE, THE GRAND INQUISITOR, AND THE JEW.\nThis Issachar was the most choleric Hebrew that had ever been seen in\nIsrael since the Captivity in Babylon.\n\"What!\" said he, \"thou bitch of a Galilean, was not the Inquisitor\nenough for thee? Must this rascal also share with me?\"\nIn saying this he drew a long poniard which he always carried about him;\nand not imagining that his adversary had any arms he threw himself upon\nCandide: but our honest Westphalian had received a handsome sword from\nthe old woman along with the suit of clothes. He drew his rapier,\ndespite his gentleness, and laid the Israelite stone dead upon the\ncushions at Cunegonde's feet.\n\"Holy Virgin!\" cried she, \"what will become of us? A man killed in my\napartment! If the officers of justice come, we are lost!\"\n\"Had not Pangloss been hanged,\" said Candide, \"he would give us good\ncounsel in this emergency, for he was a profound philosopher. Failing\nhim let us consult the old woman.\"\nShe was very prudent and commenced to give her opinion when suddenly\nanother little door opened. It was an hour after midnight, it was the\nbeginning of Sunday. This day belonged to my lord the Inquisitor. He\nentered, and saw the whipped Candide, sword in hand, a dead man upon the\nfloor, Cunegonde aghast, and the old woman giving counsel.\nAt this moment, the following is what passed in the soul of Candide, and\nhow he reasoned:\nIf this holy man call in assistance, he will surely have me burnt; and\nCunegonde will perhaps be served in the same manner; he was the cause of\nmy being cruelly whipped; he is my rival; and, as I have now begun to\nkill, I will kill away, for there is no time to hesitate. This reasoning\nwas clear and instantaneous; so that without giving time to the\nInquisitor to recover from his surprise, he pierced him through and\nthrough, and cast him beside the Jew.\n\"Yet again!\" said Cunegonde, \"now there is no mercy for us, we are\nexcommunicated, our last hour has come. How could you do it? you,\nnaturally so gentle, to slay a Jew and a prelate in two minutes!\"\n\"My beautiful young lady,\" responded Candide, \"when one is a lover,\njealous and whipped by the Inquisition, one stops at nothing.\"\nThe old woman then put in her word, saying:\n\"There are three Andalusian horses in the stable with bridles and\nsaddles, let the brave Candide get them ready; madame has money, jewels;\nlet us therefore mount quickly on horseback, though I can sit only on\none buttock; let us set out for Cadiz, it is the finest weather in the\nworld, and there is great pleasure in travelling in the cool of the\nnight.\"\nImmediately Candide saddled the three horses, and Cunegonde, the old\nwoman and he, travelled thirty miles at a stretch. While they were\njourneying, the Holy Brotherhood entered the house; my lord the\nInquisitor was interred in a handsome church, and Issachar's body was\nthrown upon a dunghill.\nCandide, Cunegonde, and the old woman, had now reached the little town\nof Avacena in the midst of the mountains of the Sierra Morena, and were\nspeaking as follows in a public inn.\nX\nIN WHAT DISTRESS CANDIDE, CUNEGONDE, AND THE OLD WOMAN ARRIVED AT CADIZ;\nAND OF THEIR EMBARKATION.\n\"Who was it that robbed me of my money and jewels?\" said Cunegonde, all\nbathed in tears. \"How shall we live? What shall we do? Where find\nInquisitors or Jews who will give me more?\"\n\"Alas!\" said the old woman, \"I have a shrewd suspicion of a reverend\nGrey Friar, who stayed last night in the same inn with us at Badajos.\nGod preserve me from judging rashly, but he came into our room twice,\nand he set out upon his journey long before us.\"\n\"Alas!\" said Candide, \"dear Pangloss has often demonstrated to me that\nthe goods of this world are common to all men, and that each has an\nequal right to them. But according to these principles the Grey Friar\nought to have left us enough to carry us through our journey. Have you\nnothing at all left, my dear Cunegonde?\"\n\"Not a farthing,\" said she.\n\"What then must we do?\" said Candide.\n\"Sell one of the horses,\" replied the old woman. \"I will ride behind\nMiss Cunegonde, though I can hold myself only on one buttock, and we\nshall reach Cadiz.\"\nIn the same inn there was a Benedictine prior who bought the horse for a\ncheap price. Candide, Cunegonde, and the old woman, having passed\nthrough Lucena, Chillas, and Lebrixa, arrived at length at Cadiz. A\nfleet was there getting ready, and troops assembling to bring to reason\nthe reverend Jesuit Fathers of Paraguay, accused of having made one of\nthe native tribes in the neighborhood of San Sacrament revolt against\nthe Kings of Spain and Portugal. Candide having been in the Bulgarian\nservice, performed the military exercise before the general of this\nlittle army with so graceful an address, with so intrepid an air, and\nwith such agility and expedition, that he was given the command of a\ncompany of foot. Now, he was a captain! He set sail with Miss Cunegonde,\nthe old woman, two valets, and the two Andalusian horses, which had\nbelonged to the grand Inquisitor of Portugal.\nDuring their voyage they reasoned a good deal on the philosophy of poor\nPangloss.\n\"We are going into another world,\" said Candide; \"and surely it must be\nthere that all is for the best. For I must confess there is reason to\ncomplain a little of what passeth in our world in regard to both\nnatural and moral philosophy.\"\n\"I love you with all my heart,\" said Cunegonde; \"but my soul is still\nfull of fright at that which I have seen and experienced.\"\n\"All will be well,\" replied Candide; \"the sea of this new world is\nalready better than our European sea; it is calmer, the winds more\nregular. It is certainly the New World which is the best of all possible\nworlds.\"\n\"God grant it,\" said Cunegonde; \"but I have been so horribly unhappy\nthere that my heart is almost closed to hope.\"\n\"You complain,\" said the old woman; \"alas! you have not known such\nmisfortunes as mine.\"\nCunegonde almost broke out laughing, finding the good woman very\namusing, for pretending to have been as unfortunate as she.\n\"Alas!\" said Cunegonde, \"my good mother, unless you have been ravished\nby two Bulgarians, have received two deep wounds in your belly, have had\ntwo castles demolished, have had two mothers cut to pieces before your\neyes, and two of your lovers whipped at an _auto-da-f\u00e9_, I do not\nconceive how you could be more unfortunate than I. Add that I was born a\nbaroness of seventy-two quarterings--and have been a cook!\"\n\"Miss,\" replied the old woman, \"you do not know my birth; and were I to\nshow you my backside, you would not talk in that manner, but would\nsuspend your judgment.\"\nThis speech having raised extreme curiosity in the minds of Cunegonde\nand Candide, the old woman spoke to them as follows.\nXI\nHISTORY OF THE OLD WOMAN.\n\"I had not always bleared eyes and red eyelids; neither did my nose\nalways touch my chin; nor was I always a servant. I am the daughter of\nPope Urban X,[10] and of the Princess of Palestrina. Until the age of\nfourteen I was brought up in a palace, to which all the castles of your\nGerman barons would scarcely have served for stables; and one of my\nrobes was worth more than all the magnificence of Westphalia. As I grew\nup I improved in beauty, wit, and every graceful accomplishment, in the\nmidst of pleasures, hopes, and respectful homage. Already I inspired\nlove. My throat was formed, and such a throat! white, firm, and shaped\nlike that of the Venus of Medici; and what eyes! what eyelids! what\nblack eyebrows! such flames darted from my dark pupils that they\neclipsed the scintillation of the stars--as I was told by the poets in\nour part of the world. My waiting women, when dressing and undressing\nme, used to fall into an ecstasy, whether they viewed me before or\nbehind; how glad would the gentlemen have been to perform that office\nfor them!\n\"I was affianced to the most excellent Prince of Massa Carara. Such a\nprince! as handsome as myself, sweet-tempered, agreeable, brilliantly\nwitty, and sparkling with love. I loved him as one loves for the first\ntime--with idolatry, with transport. The nuptials were prepared. There\nwas surprising pomp and magnificence; there were _f\u00eates_, carousals,\ncontinual _opera bouffe_; and all Italy composed sonnets in my praise,\nthough not one of them was passable. I was just upon the point of\nreaching the summit of bliss, when an old marchioness who had been\nmistress to the Prince, my husband, invited him to drink chocolate with\nher. He died in less than two hours of most terrible convulsions. But\nthis is only a bagatelle. My mother, in despair, and scarcely less\nafflicted than myself, determined to absent herself for some time from\nso fatal a place. She had a very fine estate in the neighbourhood of\nGaeta. We embarked on board a galley of the country which was gilded\nlike the great altar of St. Peter's at Rome. A Sallee corsair swooped\ndown and boarded us. Our men defended themselves like the Pope's\nsoldiers; they flung themselves upon their knees, and threw down their\narms, begging of the corsair an absolution _in articulo mortis_.\n\"Instantly they were stripped as bare as monkeys; my mother, our maids\nof honour, and myself were all served in the same manner. It is amazing\nwith what expedition those gentry undress people. But what surprised me\nmost was, that they thrust their fingers into the part of our bodies\nwhich the generality of women suffer no other instrument but--pipes to\nenter. It appeared to me a very strange kind of ceremony; but thus one\njudges of things when one has not seen the world. I afterwards learnt\nthat it was to try whether we had concealed any diamonds. This is the\npractice established from time immemorial, among civilised nations that\nscour the seas. I was informed that the very religious Knights of Malta\nnever fail to make this search when they take any Turkish prisoners of\neither sex. It is a law of nations from which they never deviate.\n\"I need not tell _you_ how great a hardship it was for a young princess\nand her mother to be made slaves and carried to Morocco. You may easily\nimagine all we had to suffer on board the pirate vessel. My mother was\nstill very handsome; our maids of honour, and even our waiting women,\nhad more charms than are to be found in all Africa. As for myself, I was\nravishing, was exquisite, grace itself, and I was a virgin! I did not\nremain so long; this flower, which had been reserved for the handsome\nPrince of Massa Carara, was plucked by the corsair captain. He was an\nabominable negro, and yet believed that he did me a great deal of\nhonour. Certainly the Princess of Palestrina and myself must have been\nvery strong to go through all that we experienced until our arrival at\nMorocco. But let us pass on; these are such common things as not to be\nworth mentioning.\n\"Morocco swam in blood when we arrived. Fifty sons of the Emperor\nMuley-Ismael[11] had each their adherents; this produced fifty civil\nwars, of blacks against blacks, and blacks against tawnies, and tawnies\nagainst tawnies, and mulattoes against mulattoes. In short it was a\ncontinual carnage throughout the empire.\n\"No sooner were we landed, than the blacks of a contrary faction to that\nof my captain attempted to rob him of his booty. Next to jewels and gold\nwe were the most valuable things he had. I was witness to such a battle\nas you have never seen in your European climates. The northern nations\nhave not that heat in their blood, nor that raging lust for women, so\ncommon in Africa. It seems that you Europeans have only milk in your\nveins; but it is vitriol, it is fire which runs in those of the\ninhabitants of Mount Atlas and the neighbouring countries. They fought\nwith the fury of the lions, tigers, and serpents of the country, to see\nwho should have us. A Moor seized my mother by the right arm, while my\ncaptain's lieutenant held her by the left; a Moorish soldier had hold of\nher by one leg, and one of our corsairs held her by the other. Thus\nalmost all our women were drawn in quarters by four men. My captain\nconcealed me behind him; and with his drawn scimitar cut and slashed\nevery one that opposed his fury. At length I saw all our Italian women,\nand my mother herself, torn, mangled, massacred, by the monsters who\ndisputed over them. The slaves, my companions, those who had taken them,\nsoldiers, sailors, blacks, whites, mulattoes, and at last my captain,\nall were killed, and I remained dying on a heap of dead. Such scenes as\nthis were transacted through an extent of three hundred leagues--and yet\nthey never missed the five prayers a day ordained by Mahomet.\n\"With difficulty I disengaged myself from such a heap of slaughtered\nbodies, and crawled to a large orange tree on the bank of a neighbouring\nrivulet, where I fell, oppressed with fright, fatigue, horror, despair,\nand hunger. Immediately after, my senses, overpowered, gave themselves\nup to sleep, which was yet more swooning than repose. I was in this\nstate of weakness and insensibility, between life and death, when I\nfelt myself pressed by something that moved upon my body. I opened my\neyes, and saw a white man, of good countenance, who sighed, and who said\nbetween his teeth: '_O che sciagura d'essere senza coglioni!_'\"[12]\nXII\nTHE ADVENTURES OF THE OLD WOMAN CONTINUED.\n\"Astonished and delighted to hear my native language, and no less\nsurprised at what this man said, I made answer that there were much\ngreater misfortunes than that of which he complained. I told him in a\nfew words of the horrors which I had endured, and fainted a second time.\nHe carried me to a neighbouring house, put me to bed, gave me food,\nwaited upon me, consoled me, flattered me; he told me that he had never\nseen any one so beautiful as I, and that he never so much regretted the\nloss of what it was impossible to recover.\n\"'I was born at Naples,' said he, 'there they geld two or three thousand\nchildren every year; some die of the operation, others acquire a voice\nmore beautiful than that of women, and others are raised to offices of\nstate.[13] This operation was performed on me with great success and I\nwas chapel musician to madam, the Princess of Palestrina.'\n\"'To my mother!' cried I.\n\"'Your mother!' cried he, weeping. 'What! can you be that young\nprincess whom I brought up until the age of six years, and who promised\nso early to be as beautiful as you?'\n\"'It is I, indeed; but my mother lies four hundred yards hence, torn in\nquarters, under a heap of dead bodies.'\n\"I told him all my adventures, and he made me acquainted with his;\ntelling me that he had been sent to the Emperor of Morocco by a\nChristian power, to conclude a treaty with that prince, in consequence\nof which he was to be furnished with military stores and ships to help\nto demolish the commerce of other Christian Governments.\n\"'My mission is done,' said this honest eunuch; 'I go to embark for\nCeuta, and will take you to Italy. _Ma che sciagura d'essere senza\ncoglioni!_'\n\"I thanked him with tears of commiseration; and instead of taking me to\nItaly he conducted me to Algiers, where he sold me to the Dey. Scarcely\nwas I sold, than the plague which had made the tour of Africa, Asia, and\nEurope, broke out with great malignancy in Algiers. You have seen\nearthquakes; but pray, miss, have you ever had the plague?\"\n\"Never,\" answered Cunegonde.\n\"If you had,\" said the old woman, \"you would acknowledge that it is far\nmore terrible than an earthquake. It is common in Africa, and I caught\nit. Imagine to yourself the distressed situation of the daughter of a\nPope, only fifteen years old, who, in less than three months, had felt\nthe miseries of poverty and slavery, had been ravished almost every day,\nhad beheld her mother drawn in quarters, had experienced famine and war,\nand was dying of the plague in Algiers. I did not die, however, but my\neunuch, and the Dey, and almost the whole seraglio of Algiers perished.\n\"As soon as the first fury of this terrible pestilence was over, a sale\nwas made of the Dey's slaves; I was purchased by a merchant, and carried\nto Tunis; this man sold me to another merchant, who sold me again to\nanother at Tripoli; from Tripoli I was sold to Alexandria, from\nAlexandria to Smyrna, and from Smyrna to Constantinople. At length I\nbecame the property of an Aga of the Janissaries, who was soon ordered\naway to the defence of Azof, then besieged by the Russians.\n\"The Aga, who was a very gallant man, took his whole seraglio with him,\nand lodged us in a small fort on the Palus M\u00e9otides, guarded by two\nblack eunuchs and twenty soldiers. The Turks killed prodigious numbers\nof the Russians, but the latter had their revenge. Azof was destroyed by\nfire, the inhabitants put to the sword, neither sex nor age was spared;\nuntil there remained only our little fort, and the enemy wanted to\nstarve us out. The twenty Janissaries had sworn they would never\nsurrender. The extremities of famine to which they were reduced, obliged\nthem to eat our two eunuchs, for fear of violating their oath. And at\nthe end of a few days they resolved also to devour the women.\n\"We had a very pious and humane Iman, who preached an excellent sermon,\nexhorting them not to kill us all at once.\n\"'Only cut off a buttock of each of those ladies,' said he, 'and you'll\nfare extremely well; if you must go to it again, there will be the same\nentertainment a few days hence; heaven will accept of so charitable an\naction, and send you relief.'\n\"He had great eloquence; he persuaded them; we underwent this terrible\noperation. The Iman applied the same balsam to us, as he does to\nchildren after circumcision; and we all nearly died.\n\"Scarcely had the Janissaries finished the repast with which we had\nfurnished them, than the Russians came in flat-bottomed boats; not a\nJanissary escaped. The Russians paid no attention to the condition we\nwere in. There are French surgeons in all parts of the world; one of\nthem who was very clever took us under his care--he cured us; and as\nlong as I live I shall remember that as soon as my wounds were healed he\nmade proposals to me. He bid us all be of good cheer, telling us that\nthe like had happened in many sieges, and that it was according to the\nlaws of war.\n\"As soon as my companions could walk, they were obliged to set out for\nMoscow. I fell to the share of a Boyard who made me his gardener, and\ngave me twenty lashes a day. But this nobleman having in two years' time\nbeen broke upon the wheel along with thirty more Boyards for some broils\nat court, I profited by that event; I fled. I traversed all Russia; I\nwas a long time an inn-holder's servant at Riga, the same at Rostock, at\nVismar, at Leipzig, at Cassel, at Utrecht, at Leyden, at the Hague, at\nRotterdam. I waxed old in misery and disgrace, having only one-half of\nmy posteriors, and always remembering I was a Pope's daughter. A hundred\ntimes I was upon the point of killing myself; but still I loved life.\nThis ridiculous foible is perhaps one of our most fatal characteristics;\nfor is there anything more absurd than to wish to carry continually a\nburden which one can always throw down? to detest existence and yet to\ncling to one's existence? in brief, to caress the serpent which devours\nus, till he has eaten our very heart?\n\"In the different countries which it has been my lot to traverse, and\nthe numerous inns where I have been servant, I have taken notice of a\nvast number of people who held their own existence in abhorrence, and\nyet I never knew of more than eight who voluntarily put an end to their\nmisery; three negroes, four Englishmen, and a German professor named\nRobek.[14] I ended by being servant to the Jew, Don Issachar, who placed\nme near your presence, my fair lady. I am determined to share your fate,\nand have been much more affected with your misfortunes than with my own.\nI would never even have spoken to you of my misfortunes, had you not\npiqued me a little, and if it were not customary to tell stories on\nboard a ship in order to pass away the time. In short, Miss Cunegonde, I\nhave had experience, I know the world; therefore I advise you to divert\nyourself, and prevail upon each passenger to tell his story; and if\nthere be one of them all, that has not cursed his life many a time, that\nhas not frequently looked upon himself as the unhappiest of mortals, I\ngive you leave to throw me headforemost into the sea.\"\nXIII\nHOW CANDIDE WAS FORCED AWAY FROM HIS FAIR CUNEGONDE AND THE OLD WOMAN.\nThe beautiful Cunegonde having heard the old woman's history, paid her\nall the civilities due to a person of her rank and merit. She likewise\naccepted her proposal, and engaged all the passengers, one after the\nother, to relate their adventures; and then both she and Candide allowed\nthat the old woman was in the right.\n\"It is a great pity,\" said Candide, \"that the sage Pangloss was hanged\ncontrary to custom at an _auto-da-f\u00e9_; he would tell us most amazing\nthings in regard to the physical and moral evils that overspread earth\nand sea, and I should be able, with due respect, to make a few\nobjections.\"\nWhile each passenger was recounting his story, the ship made her way.\nThey landed at Buenos Ayres. Cunegonde, Captain Candide, and the old\nwoman, waited on the Governor, Don Fernando d'Ibaraa, y Figueora, y\nMascarenes, y Lampourdos, y Souza. This nobleman had a stateliness\nbecoming a person who bore so many names. He spoke to men with so noble\na disdain, carried his nose so loftily, raised his voice so\nunmercifully, assumed so imperious an air, and stalked with such\nintolerable pride, that those who saluted him were strongly inclined to\ngive him a good drubbing. Cunegonde appeared to him the most beautiful\nhe had ever met. The first thing he did was to ask whether she was not\nthe captain's wife. The manner in which he asked the question alarmed\nCandide; he durst not say she was his wife, because indeed she was not;\nneither durst he say she was his sister, because it was not so; and\nalthough this obliging lie had been formerly much in favour among the\nancients, and although it could be useful to the moderns, his soul was\ntoo pure to betray the truth.\n\"Miss Cunegonde,\" said he, \"is to do me the honour to marry me, and we\nbeseech your excellency to deign to sanction our marriage.\"\nDon Fernando d'Ibaraa, y Figueora, y Mascarenes, y Lampourdos, y Souza,\nturning up his moustachios, smiled mockingly, and ordered Captain\nCandide to go and review his company. Candide obeyed, and the Governor\nremained alone with Miss Cunegonde. He declared his passion, protesting\nhe would marry her the next day in the face of the church, or otherwise,\njust as should be agreeable to herself. Cunegonde asked a quarter of an\nhour to consider of it, to consult the old woman, and to take her\nresolution.\nThe old woman spoke thus to Cunegonde:\n\"Miss, you have seventy-two quarterings, and not a farthing; it is now\nin your power to be wife to the greatest lord in South America, who has\nvery beautiful moustachios. Is it for you to pique yourself upon\ninviolable fidelity? You have been ravished by Bulgarians; a Jew and an\nInquisitor have enjoyed your favours. Misfortune gives sufficient\nexcuse. I own, that if I were in your place, I should have no scruple in\nmarrying the Governor and in making the fortune of Captain Candide.\"\nWhile the old woman spoke with all the prudence which age and experience\ngave, a small ship entered the port on board of which were an Alcalde\nand his alguazils, and this was what had happened.\nAs the old woman had shrewdly guessed, it was a Grey Friar who stole\nCunegonde's money and jewels in the town of Badajos, when she and\nCandide were escaping. The Friar wanted to sell some of the diamonds to\na jeweller; the jeweller knew them to be the Grand Inquisitor's. The\nFriar before he was hanged confessed he had stolen them. He described\nthe persons, and the route they had taken. The flight of Cunegonde and\nCandide was already known. They were traced to Cadiz. A vessel was\nimmediately sent in pursuit of them. The vessel was already in the port\nof Buenos Ayres. The report spread that the Alcalde was going to land,\nand that he was in pursuit of the murderers of my lord the Grand\nInquisitor. The prudent old woman saw at once what was to be done.\n\"You cannot run away,\" said she to Cunegonde, \"and you have nothing to\nfear, for it was not you that killed my lord; besides the Governor who\nloves you will not suffer you to be ill-treated; therefore stay.\"\nShe then ran immediately to Candide.\n\"Fly,\" said she, \"or in an hour you will be burnt.\"\nThere was not a moment to lose; but how could he part from Cunegonde,\nand where could he flee for shelter?\nXIV\nHOW CANDIDE AND CACAMBO WERE RECEIVED BY THE JESUITS OF PARAGUAY.\nCandide had brought such a valet with him from Cadiz, as one often meets\nwith on the coasts of Spain and in the American colonies. He was a\nquarter Spaniard, born of a mongrel in Tucuman; he had been singing-boy,\nsacristan, sailor, monk, pedlar, soldier, and lackey. His name was\nCacambo, and he loved his master, because his master was a very good\nman. He quickly saddled the two Andalusian horses.\n\"Come, master, let us follow the old woman's advice; let us start, and\nrun without looking behind us.\"\nCandide shed tears.\n\"Oh! my dear Cunegonde! must I leave you just at a time when the\nGovernor was going to sanction our nuptials? Cunegonde, brought to such\na distance what will become of you?\"\n\"She will do as well as she can,\" said Cacambo; \"the women are never at\na loss, God provides for them, let us run.\"\n\"Whither art thou carrying me? Where shall we go? What shall we do\nwithout Cunegonde?\" said Candide.\n\"By St. James of Compostella,\" said Cacambo, \"you were going to fight\nagainst the Jesuits; let us go to fight for them; I know the road well,\nI'll conduct you to their kingdom, where they will be charmed to have a\ncaptain that understands the Bulgarian exercise. You'll make a\nprodigious fortune; if we cannot find our account in one world we shall\nin another. It is a great pleasure to see and do new things.\"\n\"You have before been in Paraguay, then?\" said Candide.\n\"Ay, sure,\" answered Cacambo, \"I was servant in the College of the\nAssumption, and am acquainted with the government of the good Fathers as\nwell as I am with the streets of Cadiz. It is an admirable government.\nThe kingdom is upwards of three hundred leagues in diameter, and divided\ninto thirty provinces; there the Fathers possess all, and the people\nnothing; it is a masterpiece of reason and justice. For my part I see\nnothing so divine as the Fathers who here make war upon the kings of\nSpain and Portugal, and in Europe confess those kings; who here kill\nSpaniards, and in Madrid send them to heaven; this delights me, let us\npush forward. You are going to be the happiest of mortals. What pleasure\nwill it be to those Fathers to hear that a captain who knows the\nBulgarian exercise has come to them!\"\nAs soon as they reached the first barrier, Cacambo told the advanced\nguard that a captain wanted to speak with my lord the Commandant. Notice\nwas given to the main guard, and immediately a Paraguayan officer ran\nand laid himself at the feet of the Commandant, to impart this news to\nhim. Candide and Cacambo were disarmed, and their two Andalusian horses\nseized. The strangers were introduced between two files of musketeers;\nthe Commandant was at the further end, with the three-cornered cap on\nhis head, his gown tucked up, a sword by his side, and a spontoon[15] in\nhis hand. He beckoned, and straightway the new-comers were encompassed\nby four-and-twenty soldiers. A sergeant told them they must wait, that\nthe Commandant could not speak to them, and that the reverend Father\nProvincial does not suffer any Spaniard to open his mouth but in his\npresence, or to stay above three hours in the province.\n\"And where is the reverend Father Provincial?\" said Cacambo.\n\"He is upon the parade just after celebrating mass,\" answered the\nsergeant, \"and you cannot kiss his spurs till three hours hence.\"\n\"However,\" said Cacambo, \"the captain is not a Spaniard, but a German,\nhe is ready to perish with hunger as well as myself; cannot we have\nsomething for breakfast, while we wait for his reverence?\"\nThe sergeant went immediately to acquaint the Commandant with what he\nhad heard.\n\"God be praised!\" said the reverend Commandant, \"since he is a German, I\nmay speak to him; take him to my arbour.\"\nCandide was at once conducted to a beautiful summer-house, ornamented\nwith a very pretty colonnade of green and gold marble, and with\ntrellises, enclosing parraquets, humming-birds, fly-birds, guinea-hens,\nand all other rare birds. An excellent breakfast was provided in vessels\nof gold; and while the Paraguayans were eating maize out of wooden\ndishes, in the open fields and exposed to the heat of the sun, the\nreverend Father Commandant retired to his arbour.\nHe was a very handsome young man, with a full face, white skin but high\nin colour; he had an arched eyebrow, a lively eye, red ears, vermilion\nlips, a bold air, but such a boldness as neither belonged to a Spaniard\nnor a Jesuit. They returned their arms to Candide and Cacambo, and also\nthe two Andalusian horses; to whom Cacambo gave some oats to eat just by\nthe arbour, having an eye upon them all the while for fear of a\nsurprise.\nCandide first kissed the hem of the Commandant's robe, then they sat\ndown to table.\n\"You are, then, a German?\" said the Jesuit to him in that language.\n\"Yes, reverend Father,\" answered Candide.\nAs they pronounced these words they looked at each other with great\namazement, and with such an emotion as they could not conceal.\n\"And from what part of Germany do you come?\" said the Jesuit.\n\"I am from the dirty province of Westphalia,\" answered Candide; \"I was\nborn in the Castle of Thunder-ten-Tronckh.\"\n\"Oh! Heavens! is it possible?\" cried the Commandant.\n\"What a miracle!\" cried Candide.\n\"Is it really you?\" said the Commandant.\n\"It is not possible!\" said Candide.\nThey drew back; they embraced; they shed rivulets of tears.\n\"What, is it you, reverend Father? You, the brother of the fair\nCunegonde! You, that was slain by the Bulgarians! You, the Baron's son!\nYou, a Jesuit in Paraguay! I must confess this is a strange world that\nwe live in. Oh, Pangloss! Pangloss! how glad you would be if you had not\nbeen hanged!\"\nThe Commandant sent away the negro slaves and the Paraguayans, who\nserved them with liquors in goblets of rock-crystal. He thanked God and\nSt. Ignatius a thousand times; he clasped Candide in his arms; and their\nfaces were all bathed with tears.\n\"You will be more surprised, more affected, and transported,\" said\nCandide, \"when I tell you that Cunegonde, your sister, whom you believe\nto have been ripped open, is in perfect health.\"\n\"Where?\"\n\"In your neighbourhood, with the Governor of Buenos Ayres; and I was\ngoing to fight against you.\"\nEvery word which they uttered in this long conversation but added wonder\nto wonder. Their souls fluttered on their tongues, listened in their\nears, and sparkled in their eyes. As they were Germans, they sat a good\nwhile at table, waiting for the reverend Father Provincial, and the\nCommandant spoke to his dear Candide as follows.\nXV\nHOW CANDIDE KILLED THE BROTHER OF HIS DEAR CUNEGONDE.\n\"I shall have ever present to my memory the dreadful day, on which I saw\nmy father and mother killed, and my sister ravished. When the Bulgarians\nretired, my dear sister could not be found; but my mother, my father,\nand myself, with two maid-servants and three little boys all of whom had\nbeen slain, were put in a hearse, to be conveyed for interment to a\nchapel belonging to the Jesuits, within two leagues of our family seat.\nA Jesuit sprinkled us with some holy water; it was horribly salt; a few\ndrops of it fell into my eyes; the father perceived that my eyelids\nstirred a little; he put his hand upon my heart and felt it beat. I\nreceived assistance, and at the end of three weeks I recovered. You\nknow, my dear Candide, I was very pretty; but I grew much prettier, and\nthe reverend Father Didrie,[16] Superior of that House, conceived the\ntenderest friendship for me; he gave me the habit of the order, some\nyears after I was sent to Rome. The Father-General needed new levies of\nyoung German-Jesuits. The sovereigns of Paraguay admit as few Spanish\nJesuits as possible; they prefer those of other nations as being more\nsubordinate to their commands. I was judged fit by the reverend\nFather-General to go and work in this vineyard. We set out--a Pole, a\nTyrolese, and myself. Upon my arrival I was honoured with a\nsub-deaconship and a lieutenancy. I am to-day colonel and priest. We\nshall give a warm reception to the King of Spain's troops; I will answer\nfor it that they shall be excommunicated and well beaten. Providence\nsends you here to assist us. But is it, indeed, true that my dear sister\nCunegonde is in the neighbourhood, with the Governor of Buenos Ayres?\"\nCandide assured him on oath that nothing was more true, and their tears\nbegan afresh.\nThe Baron could not refrain from embracing Candide; he called him his\nbrother, his saviour.\n\"Ah! perhaps,\" said he, \"we shall together, my dear Candide, enter the\ntown as conquerors, and recover my sister Cunegonde.\"\n\"That is all I want,\" said Candide, \"for I intended to marry her, and I\nstill hope to do so.\"\n\"You insolent!\" replied the Baron, \"would you have the impudence to\nmarry my sister who has seventy-two quarterings! I find thou hast the\nmost consummate effrontery to dare to mention so presumptuous a design!\"\nCandide, petrified at this speech, made answer:\n\"Reverend Father, all the quarterings in the world signify nothing; I\nrescued your sister from the arms of a Jew and of an Inquisitor; she has\ngreat obligations to me, she wishes to marry me; Master Pangloss always\ntold me that all men are equal, and certainly I will marry her.\"\n\"We shall see that, thou scoundrel!\" said the Jesuit Baron de\nThunder-ten-Tronckh, and that instant struck him across the face with\nthe flat of his sword. Candide in an instant drew his rapier, and\nplunged it up to the hilt in the Jesuit's belly; but in pulling it out\nreeking hot, he burst into tears.\n\"Good God!\" said he, \"I have killed my old master, my friend, my\nbrother-in-law! I am the best-natured creature in the world, and yet I\nhave already killed three men, and of these three two were priests.\"\nCacambo, who stood sentry by the door of the arbour, ran to him.\n\"We have nothing more for it than to sell our lives as dearly as we\ncan,\" said his master to him, \"without doubt some one will soon enter\nthe arbour, and we must die sword in hand.\"\nCacambo, who had been in a great many scrapes in his lifetime, did not\nlose his head; he took the Baron's Jesuit habit, put it on Candide, gave\nhim the square cap, and made him mount on horseback. All this was done\nin the twinkling of an eye.\n\"Let us gallop fast, master, everybody will take you for a Jesuit, going\nto give directions to your men, and we shall have passed the frontiers\nbefore they will be able to overtake us.\"\nHe flew as he spoke these words, crying out aloud in Spanish:\n\"Make way, make way, for the reverend Father Colonel.\"\nXVI\nADVENTURES OF THE TWO TRAVELLERS, WITH TWO GIRLS, TWO MONKEYS, AND THE\nSAVAGES CALLED OREILLONS.\nCandide and his valet had got beyond the barrier, before it was known in\nthe camp that the German Jesuit was dead. The wary Cacambo had taken\ncare to fill his wallet with bread, chocolate, bacon, fruit, and a few\nbottles of wine. With their Andalusian horses they penetrated into an\nunknown country, where they perceived no beaten track. At length they\ncame to a beautiful meadow intersected with purling rills. Here our two\nadventurers fed their horses. Cacambo proposed to his master to take\nsome food, and he set him an example.\n\"How can you ask me to eat ham,\" said Candide, \"after killing the\nBaron's son, and being doomed never more to see the beautiful Cunegonde?\nWhat will it avail me to spin out my wretched days and drag them far\nfrom her in remorse and despair? And what will the _Journal of\nTrevoux_[17] say?\"\nWhile he was thus lamenting his fate, he went on eating. The sun went\ndown. The two wanderers heard some little cries which seemed to be\nuttered by women. They did not know whether they were cries of pain or\njoy; but they started up precipitately with that inquietude and alarm\nwhich every little thing inspires in an unknown country. The noise was\nmade by two naked girls, who tripped along the mead, while two monkeys\nwere pursuing them and biting their buttocks. Candide was moved with\npity; he had learned to fire a gun in the Bulgarian service, and he was\nso clever at it, that he could hit a filbert in a hedge without touching\na leaf of the tree. He took up his double-barrelled Spanish fusil, let\nit off, and killed the two monkeys.\n\"God be praised! My dear Cacambo, I have rescued those two poor\ncreatures from a most perilous situation. If I have committed a sin in\nkilling an Inquisitor and a Jesuit, I have made ample amends by saving\nthe lives of these girls. Perhaps they are young ladies of family; and\nthis adventure may procure us great advantages in this country.\"\nHe was continuing, but stopped short when he saw the two girls tenderly\nembracing the monkeys, bathing their bodies in tears, and rending the\nair with the most dismal lamentations.\n\"Little did I expect to see such good-nature,\" said he at length to\nCacambo; who made answer:\n\"Master, you have done a fine thing now; you have slain the sweethearts\nof those two young ladies.\"\n\"The sweethearts! Is it possible? You are jesting, Cacambo, I can never\nbelieve it!\"\n\"Dear master,\" replied Cacambo; \"you are surprised at everything. Why\nshould you think it so strange that in some countries there are monkeys\nwhich insinuate themselves into the good graces of the ladies; they are\na fourth part human, as I am a fourth part Spaniard.\"\n\"Alas!\" replied Candide, \"I remember to have heard Master Pangloss say,\nthat formerly such accidents used to happen; that these mixtures were\nproductive of Centaurs, Fauns, and Satyrs; and that many of the ancients\nhad seen such monsters, but I looked upon the whole as fabulous.\"\n\"You ought now to be convinced,\" said Cacambo, \"that it is the truth,\nand you see what use is made of those creatures, by persons that have\nnot had a proper education; all I fear is that those ladies will play us\nsome ugly trick.\"\nThese sound reflections induced Candide to leave the meadow and to\nplunge into a wood. He supped there with Cacambo; and after cursing the\nPortuguese inquisitor, the Governor of Buenos Ayres, and the Baron, they\nfell asleep on moss. On awaking they felt that they could not move; for\nduring the night the Oreillons, who inhabited that country, and to whom\nthe ladies had denounced them, had bound them with cords made of the\nbark of trees. They were encompassed by fifty naked Oreillons, armed\nwith bows and arrows, with clubs and flint hatchets. Some were making a\nlarge cauldron boil, others were preparing spits, and all cried:\n\"A Jesuit! a Jesuit! we shall be revenged, we shall have excellent\ncheer, let us eat the Jesuit, let us eat him up!\"\n\"I told you, my dear master,\" cried Cacambo sadly, \"that those two girls\nwould play us some ugly trick.\"\nCandide seeing the cauldron and the spits, cried:\n\"We are certainly going to be either roasted or boiled. Ah! what would\nMaster Pangloss say, were he to see how pure nature is formed?\nEverything is right, may be, but I declare it is very hard to have lost\nMiss Cunegonde and to be put upon a spit by Oreillons.\"\nCacambo never lost his head.\n\"Do not despair,\" said he to the disconsolate Candide, \"I understand a\nlittle of the jargon of these people, I will speak to them.\"\n\"Be sure,\" said Candide, \"to represent to them how frightfully inhuman\nit is to cook men, and how very un-Christian.\"\n\"Gentlemen,\" said Cacambo, \"you reckon you are to-day going to feast\nupon a Jesuit. It is all very well, nothing is more unjust than thus to\ntreat your enemies. Indeed, the law of nature teaches us to kill our\nneighbour, and such is the practice all over the world. If we do not\naccustom ourselves to eating them, it is because we have better fare.\nBut you have not the same resources as we; certainly it is much better\nto devour your enemies than to resign to the crows and rooks the fruits\nof your victory. But, gentlemen, surely you would not choose to eat your\nfriends. You believe that you are going to spit a Jesuit, and he is your\ndefender. It is the enemy of your enemies that you are going to roast.\nAs for myself, I was born in your country; this gentleman is my master,\nand, far from being a Jesuit, he has just killed one, whose spoils he\nwears; and thence comes your mistake. To convince you of the truth of\nwhat I say, take his habit and carry it to the first barrier of the\nJesuit kingdom, and inform yourselves whether my master did not kill a\nJesuit officer. It will not take you long, and you can always eat us if\nyou find that I have lied to you. But I have told you the truth. You are\ntoo well acquainted with the principles of public law, humanity, and\njustice not to pardon us.\"\nThe Oreillons found this speech very reasonable. They deputed two of\ntheir principal people with all expedition to inquire into the truth of\nthe matter; these executed their commission like men of sense, and soon\nreturned with good news. The Oreillons untied their prisoners, showed\nthem all sorts of civilities, offered them girls, gave them refreshment,\nand reconducted them to the confines of their territories, proclaiming\nwith great joy:\n\"He is no Jesuit! He is no Jesuit!\"\nCandide could not help being surprised at the cause of his deliverance.\n\"What people!\" said he; \"what men! what manners! If I had not been so\nlucky as to run Miss Cunegonde's brother through the body, I should have\nbeen devoured without redemption. But, after all, pure nature is good,\nsince these people, instead of feasting upon my flesh, have shown me a\nthousand civilities, when then I was not a Jesuit.\"\nXVII\nARRIVAL OF CANDIDE AND HIS VALET AT EL DORADO, AND WHAT THEY SAW THERE.\n\"You see,\" said Cacambo to Candide, as soon as they had reached the\nfrontiers of the Oreillons, \"that this hemisphere is not better than the\nothers, take my word for it; let us go back to Europe by the shortest\nway.\"\n\"How go back?\" said Candide, \"and where shall we go? to my own country?\nThe Bulgarians and the Abares are slaying all; to Portugal? there I\nshall be burnt; and if we abide here we are every moment in danger of\nbeing spitted. But how can I resolve to quit a part of the world where\nmy dear Cunegonde resides?\"\n\"Let us turn towards Cayenne,\" said Cacambo, \"there we shall find\nFrenchmen, who wander all over the world; they may assist us; God will\nperhaps have pity on us.\"\nIt was not easy to get to Cayenne; they knew vaguely in which direction\nto go, but rivers, precipices, robbers, savages, obstructed them all the\nway. Their horses died of fatigue. Their provisions were consumed; they\nfed a whole month upon wild fruits, and found themselves at last near a\nlittle river bordered with cocoa trees, which sustained their lives and\ntheir hopes.\nCacambo, who was as good a counsellor as the old woman, said to Candide:\n\"We are able to hold out no longer; we have walked enough. I see an\nempty canoe near the river-side; let us fill it with cocoanuts, throw\nourselves into it, and go with the current; a river always leads to some\ninhabited spot. If we do not find pleasant things we shall at least find\nnew things.\"\n\"With all my heart,\" said Candide, \"let us recommend ourselves to\nProvidence.\"\nThey rowed a few leagues, between banks, in some places flowery, in\nothers barren; in some parts smooth, in others rugged. The stream ever\nwidened, and at length lost itself under an arch of frightful rocks\nwhich reached to the sky. The two travellers had the courage to commit\nthemselves to the current. The river, suddenly contracting at this\nplace, whirled them along with a dreadful noise and rapidity. At the end\nof four-and-twenty hours they saw daylight again, but their canoe was\ndashed to pieces against the rocks. For a league they had to creep from\nrock to rock, until at length they discovered an extensive plain,\nbounded by inaccessible mountains. The country was cultivated as much\nfor pleasure as for necessity. On all sides the useful was also the\nbeautiful. The roads were covered, or rather adorned, with carriages of\na glittering form and substance, in which were men and women of\nsurprising beauty, drawn by large red sheep which surpassed in fleetness\nthe finest coursers of Andalusia, Tetuan, and Mequinez.[18]\n\"Here, however, is a country,\" said Candide, \"which is better than\nWestphalia.\"\nHe stepped out with Cacambo towards the first village which he saw. Some\nchildren dressed in tattered brocades played at quoits on the outskirts.\nOur travellers from the other world amused themselves by looking on. The\nquoits were large round pieces, yellow, red, and green, which cast a\nsingular lustre! The travellers picked a few of them off the ground;\nthis was of gold, that of emeralds, the other of rubies--the least of\nthem would have been the greatest ornament on the Mogul's throne.\n\"Without doubt,\" said Cacambo, \"these children must be the king's sons\nthat are playing at quoits!\"\nThe village schoolmaster appeared at this moment and called them to\nschool.\n\"There,\" said Candide, \"is the preceptor of the royal family.\"\nThe little truants immediately quitted their game, leaving the quoits\non the ground with all their other playthings. Candide gathered them up,\nran to the master, and presented them to him in a most humble manner,\ngiving him to understand by signs that their royal highnesses had\nforgotten their gold and jewels. The schoolmaster, smiling, flung them\nupon the ground; then, looking at Candide with a good deal of surprise,\nwent about his business.\nThe travellers, however, took care to gather up the gold, the rubies,\nand the emeralds.\n\"Where are we?\" cried Candide. \"The king's children in this country must\nbe well brought up, since they are taught to despise gold and precious\nstones.\"\nCacambo was as much surprised as Candide. At length they drew near the\nfirst house in the village. It was built like an European palace. A\ncrowd of people pressed about the door, and there were still more in the\nhouse. They heard most agreeable music, and were aware of a delicious\nodour of cooking. Cacambo went up to the door and heard they were\ntalking Peruvian; it was his mother tongue, for it is well known that\nCacambo was born in Tucuman, in a village where no other language was\nspoken.\n\"I will be your interpreter here,\" said he to Candide; \"let us go in, it\nis a public-house.\"\nImmediately two waiters and two girls, dressed in cloth of gold, and\ntheir hair tied up with ribbons, invited them to sit down to table with\nthe landlord. They served four dishes of soup, each garnished with two\nyoung parrots; a boiled condor[19] which weighed two hundred pounds; two\nroasted monkeys, of excellent flavour; three hundred humming-birds in\none dish, and six hundred fly-birds in another; exquisite ragouts;\ndelicious pastries; the whole served up in dishes of a kind of\nrock-crystal. The waiters and girls poured out several liqueurs drawn\nfrom the sugar-cane.\nMost of the company were chapmen and waggoners, all extremely polite;\nthey asked Cacambo a few questions with the greatest circumspection, and\nanswered his in the most obliging manner.\nAs soon as dinner was over, Cacambo believed as well as Candide that\nthey might well pay their reckoning by laying down two of those large\ngold pieces which they had picked up. The landlord and landlady shouted\nwith laughter and held their sides. When the fit was over:\n\"Gentlemen,\" said the landlord, \"it is plain you are strangers, and such\nguests we are not accustomed to see; pardon us therefore for laughing\nwhen you offered us the pebbles from our highroads in payment of your\nreckoning. You doubtless have not the money of the country; but it is\nnot necessary to have any money at all to dine in this house. All\nhostelries established for the convenience of commerce are paid by the\ngovernment. You have fared but very indifferently because this is a poor\nvillage; but everywhere else, you will be received as you deserve.\"\nCacambo explained this whole discourse with great astonishment to\nCandide, who was as greatly astonished to hear it.\n\"What sort of a country then is this,\" said they to one another; \"a\ncountry unknown to all the rest of the world, and where nature is of a\nkind so different from ours? It is probably the country where all is\nwell; for there absolutely must be one such place. And, whatever Master\nPangloss might say, I often found that things went very ill in\nWestphalia.\"\nXVIII\nWHAT THEY SAW IN THE COUNTRY OF EL DORADO.\nCacambo expressed his curiosity to the landlord, who made answer:\n\"I am very ignorant, but not the worse on that account. However, we have\nin this neighbourhood an old man retired from Court who is the most\nlearned and most communicative person in the kingdom.\"\nAt once he took Cacambo to the old man. Candide acted now only a second\ncharacter, and accompanied his valet. They entered a very plain house,\nfor the door was only of silver, and the ceilings were only of gold, but\nwrought in so elegant a taste as to vie with the richest. The\nantechamber, indeed, was only encrusted with rubies and emeralds, but\nthe order in which everything was arranged made amends for this great\nsimplicity.\nThe old man received the strangers on his sofa, which was stuffed with\nhumming-birds' feathers, and ordered his servants to present them with\nliqueurs in diamond goblets; after which he satisfied their curiosity\nin the following terms:\n\"I am now one hundred and seventy-two years old, and I learnt of my late\nfather, Master of the Horse to the King, the amazing revolutions of\nPeru, of which he had been an eyewitness. The kingdom we now inhabit is\nthe ancient country of the Incas, who quitted it very imprudently to\nconquer another part of the world, and were at length destroyed by the\nSpaniards.\n\"More wise by far were the princes of their family, who remained in\ntheir native country; and they ordained, with the consent of the whole\nnation, that none of the inhabitants should ever be permitted to quit\nthis little kingdom; and this has preserved our innocence and happiness.\nThe Spaniards have had a confused notion of this country, and have\ncalled it _El Dorado_; and an Englishman, whose name was Sir Walter\nRaleigh, came very near it about a hundred years ago; but being\nsurrounded by inaccessible rocks and precipices, we have hitherto been\nsheltered from the rapaciousness of European nations, who have an\ninconceivable passion for the pebbles and dirt of our land, for the sake\nof which they would murder us to the last man.\"\nThe conversation was long: it turned chiefly on their form of\ngovernment, their manners, their women, their public entertainments,\nand the arts. At length Candide, having always had a taste for\nmetaphysics, made Cacambo ask whether there was any religion in that\ncountry.\nThe old man reddened a little.\n\"How then,\" said he, \"can you doubt it? Do you take us for ungrateful\nwretches?\"\nCacambo humbly asked, \"What was the religion in El Dorado?\"\nThe old man reddened again.\n\"Can there be two religions?\" said he. \"We have, I believe, the religion\nof all the world: we worship God night and morning.\"\n\"Do you worship but one God?\" said Cacambo, who still acted as\ninterpreter in representing Candide's doubts.\n\"Surely,\" said the old man, \"there are not two, nor three, nor four. I\nmust confess the people from your side of the world ask very\nextraordinary questions.\"\nCandide was not yet tired of interrogating the good old man; he wanted\nto know in what manner they prayed to God in El Dorado.\n\"We do not pray to Him,\" said the worthy sage; \"we have nothing to ask\nof Him; He has given us all we need, and we return Him thanks without\nceasing.\"\nCandide having a curiosity to see the priests asked where they were.\nThe good old man smiled.\n\"My friend,\" said he, \"we are all priests. The King and all the heads of\nfamilies sing solemn canticles of thanksgiving every morning,\naccompanied by five or six thousand musicians.\"\n\"What! have you no monks who teach, who dispute, who govern, who cabal,\nand who burn people that are not of their opinion?\"\n\"We must be mad, indeed, if that were the case,\" said the old man; \"here\nwe are all of one opinion, and we know not what you mean by monks.\"\nDuring this whole discourse Candide was in raptures, and he said to\nhimself:\n\"This is vastly different from Westphalia and the Baron's castle. Had\nour friend Pangloss seen El Dorado he would no longer have said that the\ncastle of Thunder-ten-Tronckh was the finest upon earth. It is evident\nthat one must travel.\"\nAfter this long conversation the old man ordered a coach and six sheep\nto be got ready, and twelve of his domestics to conduct the travellers\nto Court.\n\"Excuse me,\" said he, \"if my age deprives me of the honour of\naccompanying you. The King will receive you in a manner that cannot\ndisplease you; and no doubt you will make an allowance for the customs\nof the country, if some things should not be to your liking.\"\nCandide and Cacambo got into the coach, the six sheep flew, and in less\nthan four hours they reached the King's palace situated at the extremity\nof the capital. The portal was two hundred and twenty feet high, and one\nhundred wide; but words are wanting to express the materials of which it\nwas built. It is plain such materials must have prodigious superiority\nover those pebbles and sand which we call gold and precious stones.\nTwenty beautiful damsels of the King's guard received Candide and\nCacambo as they alighted from the coach, conducted them to the bath, and\ndressed them in robes woven of the down of humming-birds; after which\nthe great crown officers, of both sexes, led them to the King's\napartment, between two files of musicians, a thousand on each side. When\nthey drew near to the audience chamber Cacambo asked one of the great\nofficers in what way he should pay his obeisance to his Majesty; whether\nthey should throw themselves upon their knees or on their stomachs;\nwhether they should put their hands upon their heads or behind their\nbacks; whether they should lick the dust off the floor; in a word, what\nwas the ceremony?\n\"The custom,\" said the great officer, \"is to embrace the King, and to\nkiss him on each cheek.\"\nCandide and Cacambo threw themselves round his Majesty's neck. He\nreceived them with all the goodness imaginable, and politely invited\nthem to supper.\nWhile waiting they were shown the city, and saw the public edifices\nraised as high as the clouds, the market places ornamented with a\nthousand columns, the fountains of spring water, those of rose water,\nthose of liqueurs drawn from sugar-cane, incessantly flowing into the\ngreat squares, which were paved with a kind of precious stone, which\ngave off a delicious fragrancy like that of cloves and cinnamon. Candide\nasked to see the court of justice, the parliament. They told him they\nhad none, and that they were strangers to lawsuits. He asked if they had\nany prisons, and they answered no. But what surprised him most and gave\nhim the greatest pleasure was the palace of sciences, where he saw a\ngallery two thousand feet long, and filled with instruments employed in\nmathematics and physics.\nAfter rambling about the city the whole afternoon, and seeing but a\nthousandth part of it, they were reconducted to the royal palace, where\nCandide sat down to table with his Majesty, his valet Cacambo, and\nseveral ladies. Never was there a better entertainment, and never was\nmore wit shown at a table than that which fell from his Majesty. Cacambo\nexplained the King's _bon-mots_ to Candide, and notwithstanding they\nwere translated they still appeared to be _bon-mots_. Of all the things\nthat surprised Candide this was not the least.\nThey spent a month in this hospitable place. Candide frequently said to\nCacambo:\n\"I own, my friend, once more that the castle where I was born is nothing\nin comparison with this; but, after all, Miss Cunegonde is not here, and\nyou have, without doubt, some mistress in Europe. If we abide here we\nshall only be upon a footing with the rest, whereas, if we return to our\nold world, only with twelve sheep laden with the pebbles of El Dorado,\nwe shall be richer than all the kings in Europe. We shall have no more\nInquisitors to fear, and we may easily recover Miss Cunegonde.\"\nThis speech was agreeable to Cacambo; mankind are so fond of roving, of\nmaking a figure in their own country, and of boasting of what they have\nseen in their travels, that the two happy ones resolved to be no longer\nso, but to ask his Majesty's leave to quit the country.\n\"You are foolish,\" said the King. \"I am sensible that my kingdom is but\na small place, but when a person is comfortably settled in any part he\nshould abide there. I have not the right to detain strangers. It is a\ntyranny which neither our manners nor our laws permit. All men are free.\nGo when you wish, but the going will be very difficult. It is impossible\nto ascend that rapid river on which you came as by a miracle, and which\nruns under vaulted rocks. The mountains which surround my kingdom are\nten thousand feet high, and as steep as walls; they are each over ten\nleagues in breadth, and there is no other way to descend them than by\nprecipices. However, since you absolutely wish to depart, I shall give\norders to my engineers to construct a machine that will convey you very\nsafely. When we have conducted you over the mountains no one can\naccompany you further, for my subjects have made a vow never to quit the\nkingdom, and they are too wise to break it. Ask me besides anything that\nyou please.\"\n\"We desire nothing of your Majesty,\" says Candide, \"but a few sheep\nladen with provisions, pebbles, and the earth of this country.\"\nThe King laughed.\n\"I cannot conceive,\" said he, \"what pleasure you Europeans find in our\nyellow clay, but take as much as you like, and great good may it do\nyou.\"\nAt once he gave directions that his engineers should construct a machine\nto hoist up these two extraordinary men out of the kingdom. Three\nthousand good mathematicians went to work; it was ready in fifteen days,\nand did not cost more than twenty million sterling in the specie of that\ncountry. They placed Candide and Cacambo on the machine. There were two\ngreat red sheep saddled and bridled to ride upon as soon as they were\nbeyond the mountains, twenty pack-sheep laden with provisions, thirty\nwith presents of the curiosities of the country, and fifty with gold,\ndiamonds, and precious stones. The King embraced the two wanderers very\ntenderly.\nTheir departure, with the ingenious manner in which they and their sheep\nwere hoisted over the mountains, was a splendid spectacle. The\nmathematicians took their leave after conveying them to a place of\nsafety, and Candide had no other desire, no other aim, than to present\nhis sheep to Miss Cunegonde.\n\"Now,\" said he, \"we are able to pay the Governor of Buenos Ayres if Miss\nCunegonde can be ransomed. Let us journey towards Cayenne. Let us\nembark, and we will afterwards see what kingdom we shall be able to\npurchase.\"\nXIX\nWHAT HAPPENED TO THEM AT SURINAM AND HOW CANDIDE GOT ACQUAINTED WITH\nMARTIN.\nOur travellers spent the first day very agreeably. They were delighted\nwith possessing more treasure than all Asia, Europe, and Africa could\nscrape together. Candide, in his raptures, cut Cunegonde's name on the\ntrees. The second day two of their sheep plunged into a morass, where\nthey and their burdens were lost; two more died of fatigue a few days\nafter; seven or eight perished with hunger in a desert; and others\nsubsequently fell down precipices. At length, after travelling a hundred\ndays, only two sheep remained. Said Candide to Cacambo:\n\"My friend, you see how perishable are the riches of this world; there\nis nothing solid but virtue, and the happiness of seeing Cunegonde once\nmore.\"\n\"I grant all you say,\" said Cacambo, \"but we have still two sheep\nremaining, with more treasure than the King of Spain will ever have; and\nI see a town which I take to be Surinam, belonging to the Dutch. We are\nat the end of all our troubles, and at the beginning of happiness.\"\nAs they drew near the town, they saw a negro stretched upon the ground,\nwith only one moiety of his clothes, that is, of his blue linen drawers;\nthe poor man had lost his left leg and his right hand.\n\"Good God!\" said Candide in Dutch, \"what art thou doing there, friend,\nin that shocking condition?\"\n\"I am waiting for my master, Mynheer Vanderdendur, the famous merchant,\"\nanswered the negro.\n\"Was it Mynheer Vanderdendur,\" said Candide, \"that treated thee thus?\"\n\"Yes, sir,\" said the negro, \"it is the custom. They give us a pair of\nlinen drawers for our whole garment twice a year. When we work at the\nsugar-canes, and the mill snatches hold of a finger, they cut off the\nhand; and when we attempt to run away, they cut off the leg; both cases\nhave happened to me. This is the price at which you eat sugar in Europe.\nYet when my mother sold me for ten patagons[20] on the coast of Guinea,\nshe said to me: 'My dear child, bless our fetiches, adore them for ever;\nthey will make thee live happily; thou hast the honour of being the\nslave of our lords, the whites, which is making the fortune of thy\nfather and mother.' Alas! I know not whether I have made their fortunes;\nthis I know, that they have not made mine. Dogs, monkeys, and parrots\nare a thousand times less wretched than I. The Dutch fetiches, who have\nconverted me, declare every Sunday that we are all of us children of\nAdam--blacks as well as whites. I am not a genealogist, but if these\npreachers tell truth, we are all second cousins. Now, you must agree,\nthat it is impossible to treat one's relations in a more barbarous\nmanner.\"\n\"Oh, Pangloss!\" cried Candide, \"thou hadst not guessed at this\nabomination; it is the end. I must at last renounce thy optimism.\"\n\"What is this optimism?\" said Cacambo.\n\"Alas!\" said Candide, \"it is the madness of maintaining that everything\nis right when it is wrong.\"\nLooking at the negro, he shed tears, and weeping, he entered Surinam.\nThe first thing they inquired after was whether there was a vessel in\nthe harbour which could be sent to Buenos Ayres. The person to whom they\napplied was a Spanish sea-captain, who offered to agree with them upon\nreasonable terms. He appointed to meet them at a public-house, whither\nCandide and the faithful Cacambo went with their two sheep, and awaited\nhis coming.\nCandide, who had his heart upon his lips, told the Spaniard all his\nadventures, and avowed that he intended to elope with Miss Cunegonde.\n\"Then I will take good care not to carry you to Buenos Ayres,\" said the\nseaman. \"I should be hanged, and so would you. The fair Cunegonde is my\nlord's favourite mistress.\"\nThis was a thunderclap for Candide: he wept for a long while. At last he\ndrew Cacambo aside.\n\"Here, my dear friend,\" said he to him, \"this thou must do. We have,\neach of us in his pocket, five or six millions in diamonds; you are more\nclever than I; you must go and bring Miss Cunegonde from Buenos Ayres.\nIf the Governor makes any difficulty, give him a million; if he will not\nrelinquish her, give him two; as you have not killed an Inquisitor, they\nwill have no suspicion of you; I'll get another ship, and go and wait\nfor you at Venice; that's a free country, where there is no danger\neither from Bulgarians, Abares, Jews, or Inquisitors.\"\nCacambo applauded this wise resolution. He despaired at parting from so\ngood a master, who had become his intimate friend; but the pleasure of\nserving him prevailed over the pain of leaving him. They embraced with\ntears; Candide charged him not to forget the good old woman. Cacambo\nset out that very same day. This Cacambo was a very honest fellow.\nCandide stayed some time longer in Surinam, waiting for another captain\nto carry him and the two remaining sheep to Italy. After he had hired\ndomestics, and purchased everything necessary for a long voyage, Mynheer\nVanderdendur, captain of a large vessel, came and offered his services.\n\"How much will you charge,\" said he to this man, \"to carry me straight\nto Venice--me, my servants, my baggage, and these two sheep?\"\nThe skipper asked ten thousand piastres. Candide did not hesitate.\n\"Oh! oh!\" said the prudent Vanderdendur to himself, \"this stranger gives\nten thousand piastres unhesitatingly! He must be very rich.\"\nReturning a little while after, he let him know that upon second\nconsideration, he could not undertake the voyage for less than twenty\nthousand piastres.\n\"Well, you shall have them,\" said Candide.\n\"Ay!\" said the skipper to himself, \"this man agrees to pay twenty\nthousand piastres with as much ease as ten.\"\nHe went back to him again, and declared that he could not carry him to\nVenice for less than thirty thousand piastres.\n\"Then you shall have thirty thousand,\" replied Candide.\n\"Oh! oh!\" said the Dutch skipper once more to himself, \"thirty thousand\npiastres are a trifle to this man; surely these sheep must be laden with\nan immense treasure; let us say no more about it. First of all, let him\npay down the thirty thousand piastres; then we shall see.\"\nCandide sold two small diamonds, the least of which was worth more than\nwhat the skipper asked for his freight. He paid him in advance. The two\nsheep were put on board. Candide followed in a little boat to join the\nvessel in the roads. The skipper seized his opportunity, set sail, and\nput out to sea, the wind favouring him. Candide, dismayed and stupefied,\nsoon lost sight of the vessel.\n\"Alas!\" said he, \"this is a trick worthy of the old world!\"\nHe put back, overwhelmed with sorrow, for indeed he had lost sufficient\nto make the fortune of twenty monarchs. He waited upon the Dutch\nmagistrate, and in his distress he knocked over loudly at the door. He\nentered and told his adventure, raising his voice with unnecessary\nvehemence. The magistrate began by fining him ten thousand piastres for\nmaking a noise; then he listened patiently, promised to examine into his\naffair at the skipper's return, and ordered him to pay ten thousand\npiastres for the expense of the hearing.\nThis drove Candide to despair; he had, indeed, endured misfortunes a\nthousand times worse; the coolness of the magistrate and of the skipper\nwho had robbed him, roused his choler and flung him into a deep\nmelancholy. The villainy of mankind presented itself before his\nimagination in all its deformity, and his mind was filled with gloomy\nideas. At length hearing that a French vessel was ready to set sail for\nBordeaux, as he had no sheep laden with diamonds to take along with him\nhe hired a cabin at the usual price. He made it known in the town that\nhe would pay the passage and board and give two thousand piastres to any\nhonest man who would make the voyage with him, upon condition that this\nman was the most dissatisfied with his state, and the most unfortunate\nin the whole province.\nSuch a crowd of candidates presented themselves that a fleet of ships\ncould hardly have held them. Candide being desirous of selecting from\namong the best, marked out about one-twentieth of them who seemed to be\nsociable men, and who all pretended to merit his preference. He\nassembled them at his inn, and gave them a supper on condition that each\ntook an oath to relate his history faithfully, promising to choose him\nwho appeared to be most justly discontented with his state, and to\nbestow some presents upon the rest.\nThey sat until four o'clock in the morning. Candide, in listening to all\ntheir adventures, was reminded of what the old woman had said to him in\ntheir voyage to Buenos Ayres, and of her wager that there was not a\nperson on board the ship but had met with very great misfortunes. He\ndreamed of Pangloss at every adventure told to him.\n\"This Pangloss,\" said he, \"would be puzzled to demonstrate his system. I\nwish that he were here. Certainly, if all things are good, it is in El\nDorado and not in the rest of the world.\"\nAt length he made choice of a poor man of letters, who had worked ten\nyears for the booksellers of Amsterdam. He judged that there was not in\nthe whole world a trade which could disgust one more.\nThis philosopher was an honest man; but he had been robbed by his wife,\nbeaten by his son, and abandoned by his daughter who got a Portuguese to\nrun away with her. He had just been deprived of a small employment, on\nwhich he subsisted; and he was persecuted by the preachers of Surinam,\nwho took him for a Socinian. We must allow that the others were at least\nas wretched as he; but Candide hoped that the philosopher would\nentertain him during the voyage. All the other candidates complained\nthat Candide had done them great injustice; but he appeased them by\ngiving one hundred piastres to each.\nXX\nWHAT HAPPENED AT SEA TO CANDIDE AND MARTIN.\nThe old philosopher, whose name was Martin, embarked then with Candide\nfor Bordeaux. They had both seen and suffered a great deal; and if the\nvessel had sailed from Surinam to Japan, by the Cape of Good Hope, the\nsubject of moral and natural evil would have enabled them to entertain\none another during the whole voyage.\nCandide, however, had one great advantage over Martin, in that he always\nhoped to see Miss Cunegonde; whereas Martin had nothing at all to hope.\nBesides, Candide was possessed of money and jewels, and though he had\nlost one hundred large red sheep, laden with the greatest treasure upon\nearth; though the knavery of the Dutch skipper still sat heavy upon his\nmind; yet when he reflected upon what he had still left, and when he\nmentioned the name of Cunegonde, especially towards the latter end of a\nrepast, he inclined to Pangloss's doctrine.\n\"But you, Mr. Martin,\" said he to the philosopher, \"what do you think\nof all this? what are your ideas on moral and natural evil?\"\n\"Sir,\" answered Martin, \"our priests accused me of being a Socinian, but\nthe real fact is I am a Manichean.\"[21]\n\"You jest,\" said Candide; \"there are no longer Manicheans in the world.\"\n\"I am one,\" said Martin. \"I cannot help it; I know not how to think\notherwise.\"\n\"Surely you must be possessed by the devil,\" said Candide.\n\"He is so deeply concerned in the affairs of this world,\" answered\nMartin, \"that he may very well be in me, as well as in everybody else;\nbut I own to you that when I cast an eye on this globe, or rather on\nthis little ball, I cannot help thinking that God has abandoned it to\nsome malignant being. I except, always, El Dorado. I scarcely ever knew\na city that did not desire the destruction of a neighbouring city, nor a\nfamily that did not wish to exterminate some other family. Everywhere\nthe weak execrate the powerful, before whom they cringe; and the\npowerful beat them like sheep whose wool and flesh they sell. A million\nregimented assassins, from one extremity of Europe to the other, get\ntheir bread by disciplined depredation and murder, for want of more\nhonest employment. Even in those cities which seem to enjoy peace, and\nwhere the arts flourish, the inhabitants are devoured by more envy,\ncare, and uneasiness than are experienced by a besieged town. Secret\ngriefs are more cruel than public calamities. In a word I have seen so\nmuch, and experienced so much that I am a Manichean.\"\n\"There are, however, some things good,\" said Candide.\n\"That may be,\" said Martin; \"but I know them not.\"\nIn the middle of this dispute they heard the report of cannon; it\nredoubled every instant. Each took out his glass. They saw two ships in\nclose fight about three miles off. The wind brought both so near to the\nFrench vessel that our travellers had the pleasure of seeing the fight\nat their ease. At length one let off a broadside, so low and so truly\naimed, that the other sank to the bottom. Candide and Martin could\nplainly perceive a hundred men on the deck of the sinking vessel; they\nraised their hands to heaven and uttered terrible outcries, and the next\nmoment were swallowed up by the sea.\n\"Well,\" said Martin, \"this is how men treat one another.\"\n\"It is true,\" said Candide; \"there is something diabolical in this\naffair.\"\nWhile speaking, he saw he knew not what, of a shining red, swimming\nclose to the vessel. They put out the long-boat to see what it could\nbe: it was one of his sheep! Candide was more rejoiced at the recovery\nof this one sheep than he had been grieved at the loss of the hundred\nladen with the large diamonds of El Dorado.\nThe French captain soon saw that the captain of the victorious vessel\nwas a Spaniard, and that the other was a Dutch pirate, and the very same\none who had robbed Candide. The immense plunder which this villain had\namassed, was buried with him in the sea, and out of the whole only one\nsheep was saved.\n\"You see,\" said Candide to Martin, \"that crime is sometimes punished.\nThis rogue of a Dutch skipper has met with the fate he deserved.\"\n\"Yes,\" said Martin; \"but why should the passengers be doomed also to\ndestruction? God has punished the knave, and the devil has drowned the\nrest.\"\nThe French and Spanish ships continued their course, and Candide\ncontinued his conversation with Martin. They disputed fifteen successive\ndays, and on the last of those fifteen days, they were as far advanced\nas on the first. But, however, they chatted, they communicated ideas,\nthey consoled each other. Candide caressed his sheep.\n\"Since I have found thee again,\" said he, \"I may likewise chance to find\nmy Cunegonde.\"\nXXI\nCANDIDE AND MARTIN, REASONING, DRAW NEAR THE COAST OF FRANCE.\nAt length they descried the coast of France.\n\"Were you ever in France, Mr. Martin?\" said Candide.\n\"Yes,\" said Martin, \"I have been in several provinces. In some one-half\nof the people are fools, in others they are too cunning; in some they\nare weak and simple, in others they affect to be witty; in all, the\nprincipal occupation is love, the next is slander, and the third is\ntalking nonsense.\"\n\"But, Mr. Martin, have you seen Paris?\"\n\"Yes, I have. All these kinds are found there. It is a chaos--a confused\nmultitude, where everybody seeks pleasure and scarcely any one finds it,\nat least as it appeared to me. I made a short stay there. On my arrival\nI was robbed of all I had by pickpockets at the fair of St. Germain. I\nmyself was taken for a robber and was imprisoned for eight days, after\nwhich I served as corrector of the press to gain the money necessary for\nmy return to Holland on foot. I knew the whole scribbling rabble, the\nparty rabble, the fanatic rabble. It is said that there are very polite\npeople in that city, and I wish to believe it.\"\n\"For my part, I have no curiosity to see France,\" said Candide. \"You may\neasily imagine that after spending a month at El Dorado I can desire to\nbehold nothing upon earth but Miss Cunegonde. I go to await her at\nVenice. We shall pass through France on our way to Italy. Will you bear\nme company?\"\n\"With all my heart,\" said Martin. \"It is said that Venice is fit only\nfor its own nobility, but that strangers meet with a very good reception\nif they have a good deal of money. I have none of it; you have,\ntherefore I will follow you all over the world.\"\n\"But do you believe,\" said Candide, \"that the earth was originally a\nsea, as we find it asserted in that large book belonging to the\ncaptain?\"\n\"I do not believe a word of it,\" said Martin, \"any more than I do of the\nmany ravings which have been published lately.\"\n\"But for what end, then, has this world been formed?\" said Candide.\n\"To plague us to death,\" answered Martin.\n\"Are you not greatly surprised,\" continued Candide, \"at the love which\nthese two girls of the Oreillons had for those monkeys, of which I have\nalready told you?\"\n\"Not at all,\" said Martin. \"I do not see that that passion was strange.\nI have seen so many extraordinary things that I have ceased to be\nsurprised.\"\n\"Do you believe,\" said Candide, \"that men have always massacred each\nother as they do to-day, that they have always been liars, cheats,\ntraitors, ingrates, brigands, idiots, thieves, scoundrels, gluttons,\ndrunkards, misers, envious, ambitious, bloody-minded, calumniators,\ndebauchees, fanatics, hypocrites, and fools?\"\n\"Do you believe,\" said Martin, \"that hawks have always eaten pigeons\nwhen they have found them?\"\n\"Yes, without doubt,\" said Candide.\n\"Well, then,\" said Martin, \"if hawks have always had the same character\nwhy should you imagine that men may have changed theirs?\"\n\"Oh!\" said Candide, \"there is a vast deal of difference, for free\nwill----\"\nAnd reasoning thus they arrived at Bordeaux.\nXXII\nWHAT HAPPENED IN FRANCE TO CANDIDE AND MARTIN.\nCandide stayed in Bordeaux no longer than was necessary for the selling\nof a few of the pebbles of El Dorado, and for hiring a good chaise to\nhold two passengers; for he could not travel without his Philosopher\nMartin. He was only vexed at parting with his sheep, which he left to\nthe Bordeaux Academy of Sciences, who set as a subject for that year's\nprize, \"to find why this sheep's wool was red;\" and the prize was\nawarded to a learned man of the North, who demonstrated by A plus B\nminus C divided by Z, that the sheep must be red, and die of the rot.\nMeanwhile, all the travellers whom Candide met in the inns along his\nroute, said to him, \"We go to Paris.\" This general eagerness at length\ngave him, too, a desire to see this capital; and it was not so very\ngreat a _d\u00e9tour_ from the road to Venice.\nHe entered Paris by the suburb of St. Marceau, and fancied that he was\nin the dirtiest village of Westphalia.\nScarcely was Candide arrived at his inn, than he found himself attacked\nby a slight illness, caused by fatigue. As he had a very large diamond\non his finger, and the people of the inn had taken notice of a\nprodigiously heavy box among his baggage, there were two physicians to\nattend him, though he had never sent for them, and two devotees who\nwarmed his broths.\n\"I remember,\" Martin said, \"also to have been sick at Paris in my first\nvoyage; I was very poor, thus I had neither friends, devotees, nor\ndoctors, and I recovered.\"\nHowever, what with physic and bleeding, Candide's illness became\nserious. A parson of the neighborhood came with great meekness to ask\nfor a bill for the other world payable to the bearer. Candide would do\nnothing for him; but the devotees assured him it was the new fashion. He\nanswered that he was not a man of fashion. Martin wished to throw the\npriest out of the window. The priest swore that they would not bury\nCandide. Martin swore that he would bury the priest if he continued to\nbe troublesome. The quarrel grew heated. Martin took him by the\nshoulders and roughly turned him out of doors; which occasioned great\nscandal and a law-suit.\nCandide got well again, and during his convalescence he had very good\ncompany to sup with him. They played high. Candide wondered why it was\nthat the ace never came to him; but Martin was not at all astonished.\nAmong those who did him the honours of the town was a little Abb\u00e9 of\nPerigord, one of those busybodies who are ever alert, officious,\nforward, fawning, and complaisant; who watch for strangers in their\npassage through the capital, tell them the scandalous history of the\ntown, and offer them pleasure at all prices. He first took Candide and\nMartin to La Com\u00e9die, where they played a new tragedy. Candide happened\nto be seated near some of the fashionable wits. This did not prevent his\nshedding tears at the well-acted scenes. One of these critics at his\nside said to him between the acts:\n\"Your tears are misplaced; that is a shocking actress; the actor who\nplays with her is yet worse; and the play is still worse than the\nactors. The author does not know a word of Arabic, yet the scene is in\nArabia; moreover he is a man that does not believe in innate ideas; and\nI will bring you, to-morrow, twenty pamphlets written against him.\"[22]\n\"How many dramas have you in France, sir?\" said Candide to the Abb\u00e9.\n\"Five or six thousand.\"\n\"What a number!\" said Candide. \"How many good?\"\n\"Fifteen or sixteen,\" replied the other.\n\"What a number!\" said Martin.\nCandide was very pleased with an actress who played Queen Elizabeth in a\nsomewhat insipid tragedy[23] sometimes acted.\n\"That actress,\" said he to Martin, \"pleases me much; she has a likeness\nto Miss Cunegonde; I should be very glad to wait upon her.\"\nThe Perigordian Abb\u00e9 offered to introduce him. Candide, brought up in\nGermany, asked what was the etiquette, and how they treated queens of\nEngland in France.\n\"It is necessary to make distinctions,\" said the Abb\u00e9. \"In the provinces\none takes them to the inn; in Paris, one respects them when they are\nbeautiful, and throws them on the highway when they are dead.\"[24]\n\"Queens on the highway!\" said Candide.\n\"Yes, truly,\" said Martin, \"the Abb\u00e9 is right. I was in Paris when Miss\nMonime passed, as the saying is, from this life to the other. She was\nrefused what people call the _honours of sepulture_--that is to say, of\nrotting with all the beggars of the neighbourhood in an ugly cemetery;\nshe was interred all alone by her company at the corner of the Rue de\nBourgogne, which ought to trouble her much, for she thought nobly.\"\n\"That was very uncivil,\" said Candide.\n\"What would you have?\" said Martin; \"these people are made thus. Imagine\nall contradictions, all possible incompatibilities--you will find them\nin the government, in the law-courts, in the churches, in the public\nshows of this droll nation.\"\n\"Is it true that they always laugh in Paris?\" said Candide.\n\"Yes,\" said the Abb\u00e9, \"but it means nothing, for they complain of\neverything with great fits of laughter; they even do the most detestable\nthings while laughing.\"\n\"Who,\" said Candide, \"is that great pig who spoke so ill of the piece at\nwhich I wept, and of the actors who gave me so much pleasure?\"\n\"He is a bad character,\" answered the Abb\u00e9, \"who gains his livelihood by\nsaying evil of all plays and of all books. He hates whatever succeeds,\nas the eunuchs hate those who enjoy; he is one of the serpents of\nliterature who nourish themselves on dirt and spite; he is a\n_folliculaire_.\"\n\"What is a _folliculaire_?\" said Candide.\n\"It is,\" said the Abb\u00e9, \"a pamphleteer--a Fr\u00e9ron.\"[25]\nThus Candide, Martin, and the Perigordian conversed on the staircase,\nwhile watching every one go out after the performance.\n\"Although I am eager to see Cunegonde again,\" said Candide, \"I should\nlike to sup with Miss Clairon, for she appears to me admirable.\"\nThe Abb\u00e9 was not the man to approach Miss Clairon, who saw only good\ncompany.\n\"She is engaged for this evening,\" he said, \"but I shall have the honour\nto take you to the house of a lady of quality, and there you will know\nParis as if you had lived in it for years.\"\nCandide, who was naturally curious, let himself be taken to this lady's\nhouse, at the end of the Faubourg St. Honor\u00e9. The company was occupied\nin playing faro; a dozen melancholy punters held each in his hand a\nlittle pack of cards; a bad record of his misfortunes. Profound silence\nreigned; pallor was on the faces of the punters, anxiety on that of the\nbanker, and the hostess, sitting near the unpitying banker, noticed with\nlynx-eyes all the doubled and other increased stakes, as each player\ndog's-eared his cards; she made them turn down the edges again with\nsevere, but polite attention; she showed no vexation for fear of losing\nher customers. The lady insisted upon being called the Marchioness of\nParolignac. Her daughter, aged fifteen, was among the punters, and\nnotified with a covert glance the cheatings of the poor people who\ntried to repair the cruelties of fate. The Perigordian Abb\u00e9, Candide and\nMartin entered; no one rose, no one saluted them, no one looked at them;\nall were profoundly occupied with their cards.\n\"The Baroness of Thunder-ten-Tronckh was more polite,\" said Candide.\nHowever, the Abb\u00e9 whispered to the Marchioness, who half rose, honoured\nCandide with a gracious smile, and Martin with a condescending nod; she\ngave a seat and a pack of cards to Candide, who lost fifty thousand\nfrancs in two deals, after which they supped very gaily, and every one\nwas astonished that Candide was not moved by his loss; the servants said\namong themselves, in the language of servants:--\n\"Some English lord is here this evening.\"\nThe supper passed at first like most Parisian suppers, in silence,\nfollowed by a noise of words which could not be distinguished, then with\npleasantries of which most were insipid, with false news, with bad\nreasoning, a little politics, and much evil speaking; they also\ndiscussed new books.\n\"Have you seen,\" said the Perigordian Abb\u00e9, \"the romance of Sieur\nGauchat, doctor of divinity?\"[26]\n\"Yes,\" answered one of the guests, \"but I have not been able to finish\nit. We have a crowd of silly writings, but all together do not approach\nthe impertinence of 'Gauchat, Doctor of Divinity.' I am so satiated with\nthe great number of detestable books with which we are inundated that I\nam reduced to punting at faro.\"\n\"And the _M\u00e9langes_ of Archdeacon Trublet,[27] what do you say of that?\"\nsaid the Abb\u00e9.\n\"Ah!\" said the Marchioness of Parolignac, \"the wearisome mortal! How\ncuriously he repeats to you all that the world knows! How heavily he\ndiscusses that which is not worth the trouble of lightly remarking upon!\nHow, without wit, he appropriates the wit of others! How he spoils what\nhe steals! How he disgusts me! But he will disgust me no longer--it is\nenough to have read a few of the Archdeacon's pages.\"\nThere was at table a wise man of taste, who supported the Marchioness.\nThey spoke afterwards of tragedies; the lady asked why there were\ntragedies which were sometimes played and which could not be read. The\nman of taste explained very well how a piece could have some interest,\nand have almost no merit; he proved in few words that it was not enough\nto introduce one or two of those situations which one finds in all\nromances, and which always seduce the spectator, but that it was\nnecessary to be new without being odd, often sublime and always\nnatural, to know the human heart and to make it speak; to be a great\npoet without allowing any person in the piece to appear to be a poet; to\nknow language perfectly--to speak it with purity, with continuous\nharmony and without rhythm ever taking anything from sense.\n\"Whoever,\" added he, \"does not observe all these rules can produce one\nor two tragedies, applauded at a theatre, but he will never be counted\nin the ranks of good writers. There are very few good tragedies; some\nare idylls in dialogue, well written and well rhymed, others political\nreasonings which lull to sleep, or amplifications which repel; others\ndemoniac dreams in barbarous style, interrupted in sequence, with long\napostrophes to the gods, because they do not know how to speak to men,\nwith false maxims, with bombastic commonplaces!\"\nCandide listened with attention to this discourse, and conceived a great\nidea of the speaker, and as the Marchioness had taken care to place him\nbeside her, he leaned towards her and took the liberty of asking who was\nthe man who had spoken so well.\n\"He is a scholar,\" said the lady, \"who does not play, whom the Abb\u00e9\nsometimes brings to supper; he is perfectly at home among tragedies and\nbooks, and he has written a tragedy which was hissed, and a book of\nwhich nothing has ever been seen outside his bookseller's shop\nexcepting the copy which he dedicated to me.\"\n\"The great man!\" said Candide. \"He is another Pangloss!\"\nThen, turning towards him, he said:\n\"Sir, you think doubtless that all is for the best in the moral and\nphysical world, and that nothing could be otherwise than it is?\"\n\"I, sir!\" answered the scholar, \"I know nothing of all that; I find that\nall goes awry with me; that no one knows either what is his rank, nor\nwhat is his condition, what he does nor what he ought to do; and that\nexcept supper, which is always gay, and where there appears to be enough\nconcord, all the rest of the time is passed in impertinent quarrels;\nJansenist against Molinist, Parliament against the Church, men of\nletters against men of letters, courtesans against courtesans,\nfinanciers against the people, wives against husbands, relatives against\nrelatives--it is eternal war.\"\n\"I have seen the worst,\" Candide replied. \"But a wise man, who since has\nhad the misfortune to be hanged, taught me that all is marvellously\nwell; these are but the shadows on a beautiful picture.\"\n\"Your hanged man mocked the world,\" said Martin. \"The shadows are\nhorrible blots.\"\n\"They are men who make the blots,\" said Candide, \"and they cannot be\ndispensed with.\"\n\"It is not their fault then,\" said Martin.\nMost of the punters, who understood nothing of this language, drank, and\nMartin reasoned with the scholar, and Candide related some of his\nadventures to his hostess.\nAfter supper the Marchioness took Candide into her boudoir, and made him\nsit upon a sofa.\n\"Ah, well!\" said she to him, \"you love desperately Miss Cunegonde of\nThunder-ten-Tronckh?\"\n\"Yes, madame,\" answered Candide.\nThe Marchioness replied to him with a tender smile:\n\"You answer me like a young man from Westphalia. A Frenchman would have\nsaid, 'It is true that I have loved Miss Cunegonde, but seeing you,\nmadame, I think I no longer love her.'\"\n\"Alas! madame,\" said Candide, \"I will answer you as you wish.\"\n\"Your passion for her,\" said the Marchioness, \"commenced by picking up\nher handkerchief. I wish that you would pick up my garter.\"\n\"With all my heart,\" said Candide. And he picked it up.\n\"But I wish that you would put it on,\" said the lady.\nAnd Candide put it on.\n\"You see,\" said she, \"you are a foreigner. I sometimes make my Parisian\nlovers languish for fifteen days, but I give myself to you the first\nnight because one must do the honours of one's country to a young man\nfrom Westphalia.\"\nThe lady having perceived two enormous diamonds upon the hands of the\nyoung foreigner praised them with such good faith that from Candide's\nfingers they passed to her own.\nCandide, returning with the Perigordian Abb\u00e9, felt some remorse in\nhaving been unfaithful to Miss Cunegonde. The Abb\u00e9 sympathised in his\ntrouble; he had had but a light part of the fifty thousand francs lost\nat play and of the value of the two brilliants, half given, half\nextorted. His design was to profit as much as he could by the advantages\nwhich the acquaintance of Candide could procure for him. He spoke much\nof Cunegonde, and Candide told him that he should ask forgiveness of\nthat beautiful one for his infidelity when he should see her in Venice.\nThe Abb\u00e9 redoubled his politeness and attentions, and took a tender\ninterest in all that Candide said, in all that he did, in all that he\nwished to do.\n\"And so, sir, you have a rendezvous at Venice?\"\n\"Yes, monsieur Abb\u00e9,\" answered Candide. \"It is absolutely necessary\nthat I go to meet Miss Cunegonde.\"\nAnd then the pleasure of talking of that which he loved induced him to\nrelate, according to his custom, part of his adventures with the fair\nWestphalian.\n\"I believe,\" said the Abb\u00e9, \"that Miss Cunegonde has a great deal of\nwit, and that she writes charming letters?\"\n\"I have never received any from her,\" said Candide, \"for being expelled\nfrom the castle on her account I had not an opportunity for writing to\nher. Soon after that I heard she was dead; then I found her alive; then\nI lost her again; and last of all, I sent an express to her two thousand\nfive hundred leagues from here, and I wait for an answer.\"\nThe Abb\u00e9 listened attentively, and seemed to be in a brown study. He\nsoon took his leave of the two foreigners after a most tender embrace.\nThe following day Candide received, on awaking, a letter couched in\nthese terms:\n\"My very dear love, for eight days I have been ill in this town. I learn\nthat you are here. I would fly to your arms if I could but move. I was\ninformed of your passage at Bordeaux, where I left faithful Cacambo and\nthe old woman, who are to follow me very soon. The Governor of Buenos\nAyres has taken all, but there remains to me your heart. Come! your\npresence will either give me life or kill me with pleasure.\"\nThis charming, this unhoped-for letter transported Candide with an\ninexpressible joy, and the illness of his dear Cunegonde overwhelmed him\nwith grief. Divided between those two passions, he took his gold and his\ndiamonds and hurried away, with Martin, to the hotel where Miss\nCunegonde was lodged. He entered her room trembling, his heart\npalpitating, his voice sobbing; he wished to open the curtains of the\nbed, and asked for a light.\n\"Take care what you do,\" said the servant-maid; \"the light hurts her,\"\nand immediately she drew the curtain again.\n\"My dear Cunegonde,\" said Candide, weeping, \"how are you? If you cannot\nsee me, at least speak to me.\"\n\"She cannot speak,\" said the maid.\nThe lady then put a plump hand out from the bed, and Candide bathed it\nwith his tears and afterwards filled it with diamonds, leaving a bag of\ngold upon the easy chair.\nIn the midst of these transports in came an officer, followed by the\nAbb\u00e9 and a file of soldiers.\n\"There,\" said he, \"are the two suspected foreigners,\" and at the same\ntime he ordered them to be seized and carried to prison.\n\"Travellers are not treated thus in El Dorado,\" said Candide.\n\"I am more a Manichean now than ever,\" said Martin.\n\"But pray, sir, where are you going to carry us?\" said Candide.\n\"To a dungeon,\" answered the officer.\nMartin, having recovered himself a little, judged that the lady who\nacted the part of Cunegonde was a cheat, that the Perigordian Abb\u00e9 was a\nknave who had imposed upon the honest simplicity of Candide, and that\nthe officer was another knave whom they might easily silence.\nCandide, advised by Martin and impatient to see the real Cunegonde,\nrather than expose himself before a court of justice, proposed to the\nofficer to give him three small diamonds, each worth about three\nthousand pistoles.\n\"Ah, sir,\" said the man with the ivory baton, \"had you committed all the\nimaginable crimes you would be to me the most honest man in the world.\nThree diamonds! Each worth three thousand pistoles! Sir, instead of\ncarrying you to jail I would lose my life to serve you. There are orders\nfor arresting all foreigners, but leave it to me. I have a brother at\nDieppe in Normandy! I'll conduct you thither, and if you have a diamond\nto give him he'll take as much care of you as I would.\"\n\"And why,\" said Candide, \"should all foreigners be arrested?\"\n\"It is,\" the Perigordian Abb\u00e9 then made answer, \"because a poor beggar\nof the country of Atr\u00e9batie[28] heard some foolish things said. This\ninduced him to commit a parricide, not such as that of 1610 in the month\nof May,[29] but such as that of 1594 in the month of December,[30] and\nsuch as others which have been committed in other years and other months\nby other poor devils who had heard nonsense spoken.\"\nThe officer then explained what the Abb\u00e9 meant.\n\"Ah, the monsters!\" cried Candide. \"What horrors among a people who\ndance and sing! Is there no way of getting quickly out of this country\nwhere monkeys provoke tigers? I have seen no bears in my country, but\n_men_ I have beheld nowhere except in El Dorado. In the name of God,\nsir, conduct me to Venice, where I am to await Miss Cunegonde.\"\n\"I can conduct you no further than lower Normandy,\" said the officer.\nImmediately he ordered his irons to be struck off, acknowledged himself\nmistaken, sent away his men, set out with Candide and Martin for Dieppe,\nand left them in the care of his brother.\nThere was then a small Dutch ship in the harbour. The Norman, who by the\nvirtue of three more diamonds had become the most subservient of men,\nput Candide and his attendants on board a vessel that was just ready to\nset sail for Portsmouth in England.\nThis was not the way to Venice, but Candide thought he had made his way\nout of hell, and reckoned that he would soon have an opportunity for\nresuming his journey.\nXXIII\nCANDIDE AND MARTIN TOUCHED UPON THE COAST OF ENGLAND, AND WHAT THEY SAW\nTHERE.\n\"Ah, Pangloss! Pangloss! Ah, Martin! Martin! Ah, my dear Cunegonde, what\nsort of a world is this?\" said Candide on board the Dutch ship.\n\"Something very foolish and abominable,\" said Martin.\n\"You know England? Are they as foolish there as in France?\"\n\"It is another kind of folly,\" said Martin. \"You know that these two\nnations are at war for a few acres of snow in Canada,[31] and that they\nspend over this beautiful war much more than Canada is worth. To tell\nyou exactly, whether there are more people fit to send to a madhouse in\none country than the other, is what my imperfect intelligence will not\npermit. I only know in general that the people we are going to see are\nvery atrabilious.\"\nTalking thus they arrived at Portsmouth. The coast was lined with crowds\nof people, whose eyes were fixed on a fine man kneeling, with his eyes\nbandaged, on board one of the men of war in the harbour. Four soldiers\nstood opposite to this man; each of them fired three balls at his head,\nwith all the calmness in the world; and the whole assembly went away\nvery well satisfied.\n\"What is all this?\" said Candide; \"and what demon is it that exercises\nhis empire in this country?\"\nHe then asked who was that fine man who had been killed with so much\nceremony. They answered, he was an Admiral.[32]\n\"And why kill this Admiral?\"\n\"It is because he did not kill a sufficient number of men himself. He\ngave battle to a French Admiral; and it has been proved that he was not\nnear enough to him.\"\n\"But,\" replied Candide, \"the French Admiral was as far from the English\nAdmiral.\"\n\"There is no doubt of it; but in this country it is found good, from\ntime to time, to kill one Admiral to encourage the others.\"\nCandide was so shocked and bewildered by what he saw and heard, that he\nwould not set foot on shore, and he made a bargain with the Dutch\nskipper (were he even to rob him like the Surinam captain) to conduct\nhim without delay to Venice.\nThe skipper was ready in two days. They coasted France; they passed in\nsight of Lisbon, and Candide trembled. They passed through the Straits,\nand entered the Mediterranean. At last they landed at Venice.\n\"God be praised!\" said Candide, embracing Martin. \"It is here that I\nshall see again my beautiful Cunegonde. I trust Cacambo as myself. All\nis well, all will be well, all goes as well as possible.\"\nXXIV\nOF PAQUETTE AND FRIAR GIROFL\u00c9E.\nUpon their arrival at Venice, Candide went to search for Cacambo at\nevery inn and coffee-house, and among all the ladies of pleasure, but to\nno purpose. He sent every day to inquire on all the ships that came in.\nBut there was no news of Cacambo.\n\"What!\" said he to Martin, \"I have had time to voyage from Surinam to\nBordeaux, to go from Bordeaux to Paris, from Paris to Dieppe, from\nDieppe to Portsmouth, to coast along Portugal and Spain, to cross the\nwhole Mediterranean, to spend some months, and yet the beautiful\nCunegonde has not arrived! Instead of her I have only met a Parisian\nwench and a Perigordian Abb\u00e9. Cunegonde is dead without doubt, and there\nis nothing for me but to die. Alas! how much better it would have been\nfor me to have remained in the paradise of El Dorado than to come back\nto this cursed Europe! You are in the right, my dear Martin: all is\nmisery and illusion.\"\nHe fell into a deep melancholy, and neither went to see the opera, nor\nany of the other diversions of the Carnival; nay, he was proof against\nthe temptations of all the ladies.\n\"You are in truth very simple,\" said Martin to him, \"if you imagine that\na mongrel valet, who has five or six millions in his pocket, will go to\nthe other end of the world to seek your mistress and bring her to you to\nVenice. If he find her, he will keep her to himself; if he do not find\nher he will get another. I advise you to forget your valet Cacambo and\nyour mistress Cunegonde.\"\nMartin was not consoling. Candide's melancholy increased; and Martin\ncontinued to prove to him that there was very little virtue or happiness\nupon earth, except perhaps in El Dorado, where nobody could gain\nadmittance.\nWhile they were disputing on this important subject and waiting for\nCunegonde, Candide saw a young Theatin friar in St. Mark's Piazza,\nholding a girl on his arm. The Theatin looked fresh coloured, plump, and\nvigorous; his eyes were sparkling, his air assured, his look lofty, and\nhis step bold. The girl was very pretty, and sang; she looked amorously\nat her Theatin, and from time to time pinched his fat cheeks.\n\"At least you will allow me,\" said Candide to Martin, \"that these two\nare happy. Hitherto I have met with none but unfortunate people in the\nwhole habitable globe, except in El Dorado; but as to this pair, I would\nventure to lay a wager that they are very happy.\"\n\"I lay you they are not,\" said Martin.\n\"We need only ask them to dine with us,\" said Candide, \"and you will see\nwhether I am mistaken.\"\nImmediately he accosted them, presented his compliments, and invited\nthem to his inn to eat some macaroni, with Lombard partridges, and\ncaviare, and to drink some Montepulciano, Lachrym\u00e6 Christi, Cyprus and\nSamos wine. The girl blushed, the Theatin accepted the invitation and\nshe followed him, casting her eyes on Candide with confusion and\nsurprise, and dropping a few tears. No sooner had she set foot in\nCandide's apartment than she cried out:\n\"Ah! Mr. Candide does not know Paquette again.\"\nCandide had not viewed her as yet with attention, his thoughts being\nentirely taken up with Cunegonde; but recollecting her as she spoke.\n\"Alas!\" said he, \"my poor child, it is you who reduced Doctor Pangloss\nto the beautiful condition in which I saw him?\"\n\"Alas! it was I, sir, indeed,\" answered Paquette. \"I see that you have\nheard all. I have been informed of the frightful disasters that befell\nthe family of my lady Baroness, and the fair Cunegonde. I swear to you\nthat my fate has been scarcely less sad. I was very innocent when you\nknew me. A Grey Friar, who was my confessor, easily seduced me. The\nconsequences were terrible. I was obliged to quit the castle some time\nafter the Baron had sent you away with kicks on the backside. If a\nfamous surgeon had not taken compassion on me, I should have died. For\nsome time I was this surgeon's mistress, merely out of gratitude. His\nwife, who was mad with jealousy, beat me every day unmercifully; she was\na fury. The surgeon was one of the ugliest of men, and I the most\nwretched of women, to be continually beaten for a man I did not love.\nYou know, sir, what a dangerous thing it is for an ill-natured woman to\nbe married to a doctor. Incensed at the behaviour of his wife, he one\nday gave her so effectual a remedy to cure her of a slight cold, that\nshe died two hours after, in most horrid convulsions. The wife's\nrelations prosecuted the husband; he took flight, and I was thrown into\njail. My innocence would not have saved me if I had not been\ngood-looking. The judge set me free, on condition that he succeeded the\nsurgeon. I was soon supplanted by a rival, turned out of doors quite\ndestitute, and obliged to continue this abominable trade, which appears\nso pleasant to you men, while to us women it is the utmost abyss of\nmisery. I have come to exercise the profession at Venice. Ah! sir, if\nyou could only imagine what it is to be obliged to caress indifferently\nan old merchant, a lawyer, a monk, a gondolier, an abb\u00e9, to be exposed\nto abuse and insults; to be often reduced to borrowing a petticoat, only\nto go and have it raised by a disagreeable man; to be robbed by one of\nwhat one has earned from another; to be subject to the extortions of the\nofficers of justice; and to have in prospect only a frightful old age, a\nhospital, and a dung-hill; you would conclude that I am one of the most\nunhappy creatures in the world.\"[33]\nPaquette thus opened her heart to honest Candide, in the presence of\nMartin, who said to his friend:\n\"You see that already I have won half the wager.\"\nFriar Girofl\u00e9e stayed in the dining-room, and drank a glass or two of\nwine while he was waiting for dinner.\n\"But,\" said Candide to Paquette, \"you looked so gay and content when I\nmet you; you sang and you behaved so lovingly to the Theatin, that you\nseemed to me as happy as you pretend to be now the reverse.\"\n\"Ah! sir,\" answered Paquette, \"this is one of the miseries of the trade.\nYesterday I was robbed and beaten by an officer; yet to-day I must put\non good humour to please a friar.\"\nCandide wanted no more convincing; he owned that Martin was in the\nright. They sat down to table with Paquette and the Theatin; the repast\nwas entertaining; and towards the end they conversed with all\nconfidence.\n\"Father,\" said Candide to the Friar, \"you appear to me to enjoy a state\nthat all the world might envy; the flower of health shines in your face,\nyour expression makes plain your happiness; you have a very pretty girl\nfor your recreation, and you seem well satisfied with your state as a\nTheatin.\"\n\"My faith, sir,\" said Friar Girofl\u00e9e, \"I wish that all the Theatins were\nat the bottom of the sea. I have been tempted a hundred times to set\nfire to the convent, and go and become a Turk. My parents forced me at\nthe age of fifteen to put on this detestable habit, to increase the\nfortune of a cursed elder brother, whom God confound. Jealousy, discord,\nand fury, dwell in the convent. It is true I have preached a few bad\nsermons that have brought me in a little money, of which the prior stole\nhalf, while the rest serves to maintain my girls; but when I return at\nnight to the monastery, I am ready to dash my head against the walls of\nthe dormitory; and all my fellows are in the same case.\"\nMartin turned towards Candide with his usual coolness.\n\"Well,\" said he, \"have I not won the whole wager?\"\nCandide gave two thousand piastres to Paquette, and one thousand to\nFriar Girofl\u00e9e.\n\"I'll answer for it,\" said he, \"that with this they will be happy.\"\n\"I do not believe it at all,\" said Martin; \"you will, perhaps, with\nthese piastres only render them the more unhappy.\"\n\"Let that be as it may,\" said Candide, \"but one thing consoles me. I see\nthat we often meet with those whom we expected never to see more; so\nthat, perhaps, as I have found my red sheep and Paquette, it may well be\nthat I shall also find Cunegonde.\"\n\"I wish,\" said Martin, \"she may one day make you very happy; but I doubt\nit very much.\"\n\"You are very hard of belief,\" said Candide.\n\"I have lived,\" said Martin.\n\"You see those gondoliers,\" said Candide, \"are they not perpetually\nsinging?\"\n\"You do not see them,\" said Martin, \"at home with their wives and brats.\nThe Doge has his troubles, the gondoliers have theirs. It is true that,\nall things considered, the life of a gondolier is preferable to that of\na Doge; but I believe the difference to be so trifling that it is not\nworth the trouble of examining.\"\n\"People talk,\" said Candide, \"of the Senator Pococurante, who lives in\nthat fine palace on the Brenta, where he entertains foreigners in the\npolitest manner. They pretend that this man has never felt any\nuneasiness.\"\n\"I should be glad to see such a rarity,\" said Martin.\nCandide immediately sent to ask the Lord Pococurante permission to wait\nupon him the next day.\nXXV\nTHE VISIT TO LORD POCOCURANTE, A NOBLE VENETIAN.\nCandide and Martin went in a gondola on the Brenta, and arrived at the\npalace of the noble Signor Pococurante. The gardens, laid out with\ntaste, were adorned with fine marble statues. The palace was beautifully\nbuilt. The master of the house was a man of sixty, and very rich. He\nreceived the two travellers with polite indifference, which put Candide\na little out of countenance, but was not at all disagreeable to Martin.\nFirst, two pretty girls, very neatly dressed, served them with\nchocolate, which was frothed exceedingly well. Candide could not refrain\nfrom commending their beauty, grace, and address.\n\"They are good enough creatures,\" said the Senator. \"I make them lie\nwith me sometimes, for I am very tired of the ladies of the town, of\ntheir coquetries, of their jealousies, of their quarrels, of their\nhumours, of their pettinesses, of their prides, of their follies, and of\nthe sonnets which one must make, or have made, for them. But after all,\nthese two girls begin to weary me.\"\nAfter breakfast, Candide walking into a long gallery was surprised by\nthe beautiful pictures. He asked, by what master were the two first.\n\"They are by Raphael,\" said the Senator. \"I bought them at a great\nprice, out of vanity, some years ago. They are said to be the finest\nthings in Italy, but they do not please me at all. The colours are too\ndark, the figures are not sufficiently rounded, nor in good relief; the\ndraperies in no way resemble stuffs. In a word, whatever may be said, I\ndo not find there a true imitation of nature. I only care for a picture\nwhen I think I see nature itself; and there are none of this sort. I\nhave a great many pictures, but I prize them very little.\"\nWhile they were waiting for dinner Pococurante ordered a concert.\nCandide found the music delicious.\n\"This noise,\" said the Senator, \"may amuse one for half an hour; but if\nit were to last longer it would grow tiresome to everybody, though they\ndurst not own it. Music, to-day, is only the art of executing difficult\nthings, and that which is only difficult cannot please long. Perhaps I\nshould be fonder of the opera if they had not found the secret of making\nof it a monster which shocks me. Let who will go to see bad tragedies\nset to music, where the scenes are contrived for no other end than to\nintroduce two or three songs ridiculously out of place, to show off an\nactress's voice. Let who will, or who can, die away with pleasure at the\nsight of an eunuch quavering the _r\u00f4le_ of C\u00e6sar, or of Cato, and\nstrutting awkwardly upon the stage. For my part I have long since\nrenounced those paltry entertainments which constitute the glory of\nmodern Italy, and are purchased so dearly by sovereigns.\"\nCandide disputed the point a little, but with discretion. Martin was\nentirely of the Senator's opinion.\nThey sat down to table, and after an excellent dinner they went into the\nlibrary. Candide, seeing a Homer magnificently bound, commended the\nvirtuoso on his good taste.\n\"There,\" said he, \"is a book that was once the delight of the great\nPangloss, the best philosopher in Germany.\"\n\"It is not mine,\" answered Pococurante coolly. \"They used at one time to\nmake me believe that I took a pleasure in reading him. But that\ncontinual repetition of battles, so extremely like one another; those\ngods that are always active without doing anything decisive; that Helen\nwho is the cause of the war, and who yet scarcely appears in the piece;\nthat Troy, so long besieged without being taken; all these together\ncaused me great weariness. I have sometimes asked learned men whether\nthey were not as weary as I of that work. Those who were sincere have\nowned to me that the poem made them fall asleep; yet it was necessary to\nhave it in their library as a monument of antiquity, or like those rusty\nmedals which are no longer of use in commerce.\"\n\"But your Excellency does not think thus of Virgil?\" said Candide.\n\"I grant,\" said the Senator, \"that the second, fourth, and sixth books\nof his _\u00c6neid_ are excellent, but as for his pious \u00c6neas, his strong\nCloanthus, his friend Achates, his little Ascanius, his silly King\nLatinus, his bourgeois Amata, his insipid Lavinia, I think there can be\nnothing more flat and disagreeable. I prefer Tasso a good deal, or even\nthe soporific tales of Ariosto.\"\n\"May I presume to ask you, sir,\" said Candide, \"whether you do not\nreceive a great deal of pleasure from reading Horace?\"\n\"There are maxims in this writer,\" answered Pococurante, \"from which a\nman of the world may reap great benefit, and being written in energetic\nverse they are more easily impressed upon the memory. But I care little\nfor his journey to Brundusium, and his account of a bad dinner, or of\nhis low quarrel between one Rupilius whose words he says were full of\npoisonous filth, and another whose language was imbued with vinegar. I\nhave read with much distaste his indelicate verses against old women and\nwitches; nor do I see any merit in telling his friend M\u00e6cenas that if he\nwill but rank him in the choir of lyric poets, his lofty head shall\ntouch the stars. Fools admire everything in an author of reputation. For\nmy part, I read only to please myself. I like only that which serves my\npurpose.\"\nCandide, having been educated never to judge for himself, was much\nsurprised at what he heard. Martin found there was a good deal of reason\nin Pococurante's remarks.\n\"Oh! here is Cicero,\" said Candide. \"Here is the great man whom I fancy\nyou are never tired of reading.\"\n\"I never read him,\" replied the Venetian. \"What is it to me whether he\npleads for Rabirius or Cluentius? I try causes enough myself; his\nphilosophical works seem to me better, but when I found that he doubted\nof everything, I concluded that I knew as much as he, and that I had no\nneed of a guide to learn ignorance.\"\n\"Ha! here are four-score volumes of the Academy of Sciences,\" cried\nMartin. \"Perhaps there is something valuable in this collection.\"\n\"There might be,\" said Pococurante, \"if only one of those rakers of\nrubbish had shown how to make pins; but in all these volumes there is\nnothing but chimerical systems, and not a single useful thing.\"\n\"And what dramatic works I see here,\" said Candide, \"in Italian,\nSpanish, and French.\"\n\"Yes,\" replied the Senator, \"there are three thousand, and not three\ndozen of them good for anything. As to those collections of sermons,\nwhich altogether are not worth a single page of Seneca, and those huge\nvolumes of theology, you may well imagine that neither I nor any one\nelse ever opens them.\"\nMartin saw some shelves filled with English books.\n\"I have a notion,\" said he, \"that a Republican must be greatly pleased\nwith most of these books, which are written with a spirit of freedom.\"\n\"Yes,\" answered Pococurante, \"it is noble to write as one thinks; this\nis the privilege of humanity. In all our Italy we write only what we do\nnot think; those who inhabit the country of the C\u00e6sars and the\nAntoninuses dare not acquire a single idea without the permission of a\nDominican friar. I should be pleased with the liberty which inspires the\nEnglish genius if passion and party spirit did not corrupt all that is\nestimable in this precious liberty.\"\nCandide, observing a Milton, asked whether he did not look upon this\nauthor as a great man.\n\"Who?\" said Pococurante, \"that barbarian, who writes a long commentary\nin ten books of harsh verse on the first chapter of Genesis; that coarse\nimitator of the Greeks, who disfigures the Creation, and who, while\nMoses represents the Eternal producing the world by a word, makes the\nMessiah take a great pair of compasses from the armoury of heaven to\ncircumscribe His work? How can I have any esteem for a writer who has\nspoiled Tasso's hell and the devil, who transforms Lucifer sometimes\ninto a toad and other times into a pigmy, who makes him repeat the same\nthings a hundred times, who makes him dispute on theology, who, by a\nserious imitation of Ariosto's comic invention of firearms, represents\nthe devils cannonading in heaven? Neither I nor any man in Italy could\ntake pleasure in those melancholy extravagances; and the marriage of Sin\nand Death, and the snakes brought forth by Sin, are enough to turn the\nstomach of any one with the least taste, [and his long description of a\npest-house is good only for a grave-digger]. This obscure, whimsical,\nand disagreeable poem was despised upon its first publication, and I\nonly treat it now as it was treated in its own country by\ncontemporaries. For the matter of that I say what I think, and I care\nvery little whether others think as I do.\"\nCandide was grieved at this speech, for he had a respect for Homer and\nwas fond of Milton.\n\"Alas!\" said he softly to Martin, \"I am afraid that this man holds our\nGerman poets in very great contempt.\"\n\"There would not be much harm in that,\" said Martin.\n\"Oh! what a superior man,\" said Candide below his breath. \"What a great\ngenius is this Pococurante! Nothing can please him.\"\nAfter their survey of the library they went down into the garden, where\nCandide praised its several beauties.\n\"I know of nothing in so bad a taste,\" said the master. \"All you see\nhere is merely trifling. After to-morrow I will have it planted with a\nnobler design.\"\n\"Well,\" said Candide to Martin when they had taken their leave, \"you\nwill agree that this is the happiest of mortals, for he is above\neverything he possesses.\"\n\"But do you not see,\" answered Martin, \"that he is disgusted with all he\npossesses? Plato observed a long while ago that those stomachs are not\nthe best that reject all sorts of food.\"\n\"But is there not a pleasure,\" said Candide, \"in criticising\neverything, in pointing out faults where others see nothing but\nbeauties?\"\n\"That is to say,\" replied Martin, \"that there is some pleasure in having\nno pleasure.\"\n\"Well, well,\" said Candide, \"I find that I shall be the only happy man\nwhen I am blessed with the sight of my dear Cunegonde.\"\n\"It is always well to hope,\" said Martin.\nHowever, the days and the weeks passed. Cacambo did not come, and\nCandide was so overwhelmed with grief that he did not even reflect that\nPaquette and Friar Girofl\u00e9e did not return to thank him.\nXXVI\nOF A SUPPER WHICH CANDIDE AND MARTIN TOOK WITH SIX STRANGERS, AND WHO\nTHEY WERE.[34]\nOne evening that Candide and Martin were going to sit down to supper\nwith some foreigners who lodged in the same inn, a man whose complexion\nwas as black as soot, came behind Candide, and taking him by the arm,\nsaid:\n\"Get yourself ready to go along with us; do not fail.\"\nUpon this he turned round and saw--Cacambo! Nothing but the sight of\nCunegonde could have astonished and delighted him more. He was on the\npoint of going mad with joy. He embraced his dear friend.\n\"Cunegonde is here, without doubt; where is she? Take me to her that I\nmay die of joy in her company.\"\n\"Cunegonde is not here,\" said Cacambo, \"she is at Constantinople.\"\n\"Oh, heavens! at Constantinople! But were she in China I would fly\nthither; let us be off.\"\n\"We shall set out after supper,\" replied Cacambo. \"I can tell you\nnothing more; I am a slave, my master awaits me, I must serve him at\ntable; speak not a word, eat, and then get ready.\"\nCandide, distracted between joy and grief, delighted at seeing his\nfaithful agent again, astonished at finding him a slave, filled with the\nfresh hope of recovering his mistress, his heart palpitating, his\nunderstanding confused, sat down to table with Martin, who saw all these\nscenes quite unconcerned, and with six strangers who had come to spend\nthe Carnival at Venice.\nCacambo waited at table upon one of the strangers; towards the end of\nthe entertainment he drew near his master, and whispered in his ear:\n\"Sire, your Majesty may start when you please, the vessel is ready.\"\nOn saying these words he went out. The company in great surprise looked\nat one another without speaking a word, when another domestic approached\nhis master and said to him:\n\"Sire, your Majesty's chaise is at Padua, and the boat is ready.\"\nThe master gave a nod and the servant went away. The company all stared\nat one another again, and their surprise redoubled. A third valet came\nup to a third stranger, saying:\n\"Sire, believe me, your Majesty ought not to stay here any longer. I am\ngoing to get everything ready.\"\nAnd immediately he disappeared. Candide and Martin did not doubt that\nthis was a masquerade of the Carnival. Then a fourth domestic said to a\nfourth master:\n\"Your Majesty may depart when you please.\"\nSaying this he went away like the rest. The fifth valet said the same\nthing to the fifth master. But the sixth valet spoke differently to the\nsixth stranger, who sat near Candide. He said to him:\n\"Faith, Sire, they will no longer give credit to your Majesty nor to me,\nand we may perhaps both of us be put in jail this very night. Therefore\nI will take care of myself. Adieu.\"\nThe servants being all gone, the six strangers, with Candide and Martin,\nremained in a profound silence. At length Candide broke it.\n\"Gentlemen,\" said he, \"this is a very good joke indeed, but why should\nyou all be kings? For me I own that neither Martin nor I is a king.\"\nCacambo's master then gravely answered in Italian:\n\"I am not at all joking. My name is Achmet III. I was Grand Sultan many\nyears. I dethroned my brother; my nephew dethroned me, my viziers were\nbeheaded, and I am condemned to end my days in the old Seraglio. My\nnephew, the great Sultan Mahmoud, permits me to travel sometimes for my\nhealth, and I am come to spend the Carnival at Venice.\"\nA young man who sat next to Achmet, spoke then as follows:\n\"My name is Ivan. I was once Emperor of all the Russias, but was\ndethroned in my cradle. My parents were confined in prison and I was\neducated there; yet I am sometimes allowed to travel in company with\npersons who act as guards; and I am come to spend the Carnival at\nVenice.\"\nThe third said:\n\"I am Charles Edward, King of England; my father has resigned all his\nlegal rights to me. I have fought in defence of them; and above eight\nhundred of my adherents have been hanged, drawn, and quartered. I have\nbeen confined in prison; I am going to Rome, to pay a visit to the King,\nmy father, who was dethroned as well as myself and my grandfather, and I\nam come to spend the Carnival at Venice.\"\nThe fourth spoke thus in his turn:\n\"I am the King of Poland; the fortune of war has stripped me of my\nhereditary dominions; my father underwent the same vicissitudes; I\nresign myself to Providence in the same manner as Sultan Achmet, the\nEmperor Ivan, and King Charles Edward, whom God long preserve; and I am\ncome to the Carnival at Venice.\"\nThe fifth said:\n\"I am King of Poland also; I have been twice dethroned; but Providence\nhas given me another country, where I have done more good than all the\nSarmatian kings were ever capable of doing on the banks of the Vistula;\nI resign myself likewise to Providence, and am come to pass the Carnival\nat Venice.\"\nIt was now the sixth monarch's turn to speak:\n\"Gentlemen,\" said he, \"I am not so great a prince as any of you;\nhowever, I am a king. I am Theodore, elected King of Corsica; I had the\ntitle of Majesty, and now I am scarcely treated as a gentleman. I have\ncoined money, and now am not worth a farthing; I have had two\nsecretaries of state, and now I have scarce a valet; I have seen myself\non a throne, and I have seen myself upon straw in a common jail in\nLondon. I am afraid that I shall meet with the same treatment here\nthough, like your majesties, I am come to see the Carnival at Venice.\"\nThe other five kings listened to this speech with generous compassion.\nEach of them gave twenty sequins to King Theodore to buy him clothes and\nlinen; and Candide made him a present of a diamond worth two thousand\nsequins.\n\"Who can this private person be,\" said the five kings to one another,\n\"who is able to give, and really has given, a hundred times as much as\nany of us?\"\nJust as they rose from table, in came four Serene Highnesses, who had\nalso been stripped of their territories by the fortune of war, and were\ncome to spend the Carnival at Venice. But Candide paid no regard to\nthese newcomers, his thoughts were entirely employed on his voyage to\nConstantinople, in search of his beloved Cunegonde.\nXXVII\nCANDIDE'S VOYAGE TO CONSTANTINOPLE.\nThe faithful Cacambo had already prevailed upon the Turkish skipper, who\nwas to conduct the Sultan Achmet to Constantinople, to receive Candide\nand Martin on his ship. They both embarked after having made their\nobeisance to his miserable Highness.\n\"You see,\" said Candide to Martin on the way, \"we supped with six\ndethroned kings, and of those six there was one to whom I gave charity.\nPerhaps there are many other princes yet more unfortunate. For my part,\nI have only lost a hundred sheep; and now I am flying into Cunegonde's\narms. My dear Martin, yet once more Pangloss was right: all is for the\nbest.\"\n\"I wish it,\" answered Martin.\n\"But,\" said Candide, \"it was a very strange adventure we met with at\nVenice. It has never before been seen or heard that six dethroned kings\nhave supped together at a public inn.\"\n\"It is not more extraordinary,\" said Martin, \"than most of the things\nthat have happened to us. It is a very common thing for kings to be\ndethroned; and as for the honour we have had of supping in their\ncompany, it is a trifle not worth our attention.\"\nNo sooner had Candide got on board the vessel than he flew to his old\nvalet and friend Cacambo, and tenderly embraced him.\n\"Well,\" said he, \"what news of Cunegonde? Is she still a prodigy of\nbeauty? Does she love me still? How is she? Thou hast doubtless bought\nher a palace at Constantinople?\"\n\"My dear master,\" answered Cacambo, \"Cunegonde washes dishes on the\nbanks of the Propontis, in the service of a prince, who has very few\ndishes to wash; she is a slave in the family of an ancient sovereign\nnamed Ragotsky,[35] to whom the Grand Turk allows three crowns a day in\nhis exile. But what is worse still is, that she has lost her beauty and\nhas become horribly ugly.\"\n\"Well, handsome or ugly,\" replied Candide, \"I am a man of honour, and it\nis my duty to love her still. But how came she to be reduced to so\nabject a state with the five or six millions that you took to her?\"\n\"Ah!\" said Cacambo, \"was I not to give two millions to Senor Don\nFernando d'Ibaraa, y Figueora, y Mascarenes, y Lampourdos, y Souza,\nGovernor of Buenos Ayres, for permitting Miss Cunegonde to come away?\nAnd did not a corsair bravely rob us of all the rest? Did not this\ncorsair carry us to Cape Matapan, to Milo, to Nicaria, to Samos, to\nPetra, to the Dardanelles, to Marmora, to Scutari? Cunegonde and the old\nwoman serve the prince I now mentioned to you, and I am slave to the\ndethroned Sultan.\"\n\"What a series of shocking calamities!\" cried Candide. \"But after all, I\nhave some diamonds left; and I may easily pay Cunegonde's ransom. Yet it\nis a pity that she is grown so ugly.\"\nThen, turning towards Martin: \"Who do you think,\" said he, \"is most to\nbe pitied--the Sultan Achmet, the Emperor Ivan, King Charles Edward, or\nI?\"\n\"How should I know!\" answered Martin. \"I must see into your hearts to be\nable to tell.\"\n\"Ah!\" said Candide, \"if Pangloss were here, he could tell.\"\n\"I know not,\" said Martin, \"in what sort of scales your Pangloss would\nweigh the misfortunes of mankind and set a just estimate on their\nsorrows. All that I can presume to say is, that there are millions of\npeople upon earth who have a hundred times more to complain of than King\nCharles Edward, the Emperor Ivan, or the Sultan Achmet.\"\n\"That may well be,\" said Candide.\nIn a few days they reached the Bosphorus, and Candide began by paying a\nvery high ransom for Cacambo. Then without losing time, he and his\ncompanions went on board a galley, in order to search on the banks of\nthe Propontis for his Cunegonde, however ugly she might have become.\nAmong the crew there were two slaves who rowed very badly, and to whose\nbare shoulders the Levantine captain would now and then apply blows from\na bull's pizzle. Candide, from a natural impulse, looked at these two\nslaves more attentively than at the other oarsmen, and approached them\nwith pity. Their features though greatly disfigured, had a slight\nresemblance to those of Pangloss and the unhappy Jesuit and Westphalian\nBaron, brother to Miss Cunegonde. This moved and saddened him. He looked\nat them still more attentively.\n\"Indeed,\" said he to Cacambo, \"if I had not seen Master Pangloss hanged,\nand if I had not had the misfortune to kill the Baron, I should think it\nwas they that were rowing.\"\nAt the names of the Baron and of Pangloss, the two galley-slaves uttered\na loud cry, held fast by the seat, and let drop their oars. The captain\nran up to them and redoubled his blows with the bull's pizzle.\n\"Stop! stop! sir,\" cried Candide. \"I will give you what money you\nplease.\"\n\"What! it is Candide!\" said one of the slaves.\n\"What! it is Candide!\" said the other.\n\"Do I dream?\" cried Candide; \"am I awake? or am I on board a galley? Is\nthis the Baron whom I killed? Is this Master Pangloss whom I saw\nhanged?\"\n\"It is we! it is we!\" answered they.\n\"Well! is this the great philosopher?\" said Martin.\n\"Ah! captain,\" said Candide, \"what ransom will you take for Monsieur de\nThunder-ten-Tronckh, one of the first barons of the empire, and for\nMonsieur Pangloss, the profoundest metaphysician in Germany?\"\n\"Dog of a Christian,\" answered the Levantine captain, \"since these two\ndogs of Christian slaves are barons and metaphysicians, which I doubt\nnot are high dignities in their country, you shall give me fifty\nthousand sequins.\"\n\"You shall have them, sir. Carry me back at once to Constantinople, and\nyou shall receive the money directly. But no; carry me first to Miss\nCunegonde.\"\nUpon the first proposal made by Candide, however, the Levantine captain\nhad already tacked about, and made the crew ply their oars quicker than\na bird cleaves the air.\nCandide embraced the Baron and Pangloss a hundred times.\n\"And how happened it, my dear Baron, that I did not kill you? And, my\ndear Pangloss, how came you to life again after being hanged? And why\nare you both in a Turkish galley?\"\n\"And it is true that my dear sister is in this country?\" said the Baron.\n\"Yes,\" answered Cacambo.\n\"Then I behold, once more, my dear Candide,\" cried Pangloss.\nCandide presented Martin and Cacambo to them; they embraced each other,\nand all spoke at once. The galley flew; they were already in the port.\nInstantly Candide sent for a Jew, to whom he sold for fifty thousand\nsequins a diamond worth a hundred thousand, though the fellow swore to\nhim by Abraham that he could give him no more. He immediately paid the\nransom for the Baron and Pangloss. The latter threw himself at the feet\nof his deliverer, and bathed them with his tears; the former thanked him\nwith a nod, and promised to return him the money on the first\nopportunity.\n\"But is it indeed possible that my sister can be in Turkey?\" said he.\n\"Nothing is more possible,\" said Cacambo, \"since she scours the dishes\nin the service of a Transylvanian prince.\"\nCandide sent directly for two Jews and sold them some more diamonds, and\nthen they all set out together in another galley to deliver Cunegonde\nfrom slavery.\nXXVIII\nWHAT HAPPENED TO CANDIDE, CUNEGONDE, PANGLOSS, MARTIN, ETC.\n\"I ask your pardon once more,\" said Candide to the Baron, \"your pardon,\nreverend father, for having run you through the body.\"\n\"Say no more about it,\" answered the Baron. \"I was a little too hasty, I\nown, but since you wish to know by what fatality I came to be a\ngalley-slave I will inform you. After I had been cured by the surgeon of\nthe college of the wound you gave me, I was attacked and carried off by\na party of Spanish troops, who confined me in prison at Buenos Ayres at\nthe very time my sister was setting out thence. I asked leave to return\nto Rome to the General of my Order. I was appointed chaplain to the\nFrench Ambassador at Constantinople. I had not been eight days in this\nemployment when one evening I met with a young Ichoglan, who was a very\nhandsome fellow. The weather was warm. The young man wanted to bathe,\nand I took this opportunity of bathing also. I did not know that it was\na capital crime for a Christian to be found naked with a young\nMussulman. A cadi ordered me a hundred blows on the soles of the feet,\nand condemned me to the galleys. I do not think there ever was a greater\nact of injustice. But I should be glad to know how my sister came to be\nscullion to a Transylvanian prince who has taken shelter among the\nTurks.\"\n\"But you, my dear Pangloss,\" said Candide, \"how can it be that I behold\nyou again?\"\n\"It is true,\" said Pangloss, \"that you saw me hanged. I should have been\nburnt, but you may remember it rained exceedingly hard when they were\ngoing to roast me; the storm was so violent that they despaired of\nlighting the fire, so I was hanged because they could do no better. A\nsurgeon purchased my body, carried me home, and dissected me. He began\nwith making a crucial incision on me from the navel to the clavicula.\nOne could not have been worse hanged than I was. The executioner of the\nHoly Inquisition was a sub-deacon, and knew how to burn people\nmarvellously well, but he was not accustomed to hanging. The cord was\nwet and did not slip properly, and besides it was badly tied; in short,\nI still drew my breath, when the crucial incision made me give such a\nfrightful scream that my surgeon fell flat upon his back, and imagining\nthat he had been dissecting the devil he ran away, dying with fear, and\nfell down the staircase in his flight. His wife, hearing the noise,\nflew from the next room. She saw me stretched out upon the table with my\ncrucial incision. She was seized with yet greater fear than her husband,\nfled, and tumbled over him. When they came to themselves a little, I\nheard the wife say to her husband: 'My dear, how could you take it into\nyour head to dissect a heretic? Do you not know that these people always\nhave the devil in their bodies? I will go and fetch a priest this minute\nto exorcise him.' At this proposal I shuddered, and mustering up what\nlittle courage I had still remaining I cried out aloud, 'Have mercy on\nme!' At length the Portuguese barber plucked up his spirits. He sewed up\nmy wounds; his wife even nursed me. I was upon my legs at the end of\nfifteen days. The barber found me a place as lackey to a knight of Malta\nwho was going to Venice, but finding that my master had no money to pay\nme my wages I entered the service of a Venetian merchant, and went with\nhim to Constantinople. One day I took it into my head to step into a\nmosque, where I saw an old Iman and a very pretty young devotee who was\nsaying her paternosters. Her bosom was uncovered, and between her\nbreasts she had a beautiful bouquet of tulips, roses, anemones,\nranunculus, hyacinths, and auriculas. She dropped her bouquet; I picked\nit up, and presented it to her with a profound reverence. I was so long\nin delivering it that the Iman began to get angry, and seeing that I was\na Christian he called out for help. They carried me before the cadi, who\nordered me a hundred lashes on the soles of the feet and sent me to the\ngalleys. I was chained to the very same galley and the same bench as the\nyoung Baron. On board this galley there were four young men from\nMarseilles, five Neapolitan priests, and two monks from Corfu, who told\nus similar adventures happened daily. The Baron maintained that he had\nsuffered greater injustice than I, and I insisted that it was far more\ninnocent to take up a bouquet and place it again on a woman's bosom than\nto be found stark naked with an Ichoglan. We were continually disputing,\nand received twenty lashes with a bull's pizzle when the concatenation\nof universal events brought you to our galley, and you were good enough\nto ransom us.\"\n\"Well, my dear Pangloss,\" said Candide to him, \"when you had been\nhanged, dissected, whipped, and were tugging at the oar, did you always\nthink that everything happens for the best?\"\n\"I am still of my first opinion,\" answered Pangloss, \"for I am a\nphilosopher and I cannot retract, especially as Leibnitz could never be\nwrong; and besides, the pre-established harmony is the finest thing in\nthe world, and so is his _plenum_ and _materia subtilis_.\"\nXXIX\nHOW CANDIDE FOUND CUNEGONDE AND THE OLD WOMAN AGAIN.\nWhile Candide, the Baron, Pangloss, Martin, and Cacambo were relating\ntheir several adventures, were reasoning on the contingent or\nnon-contingent events of the universe, disputing on effects and causes,\non moral and physical evil, on liberty and necessity, and on the\nconsolations a slave may feel even on a Turkish galley, they arrived at\nthe house of the Transylvanian prince on the banks of the Propontis. The\nfirst objects which met their sight were Cunegonde and the old woman\nhanging towels out to dry.\nThe Baron paled at this sight. The tender, loving Candide, seeing his\nbeautiful Cunegonde embrowned, with blood-shot eyes, withered neck,\nwrinkled cheeks, and rough, red arms, recoiled three paces, seized with\nhorror, and then advanced out of good manners. She embraced Candide and\nher brother; they embraced the old woman, and Candide ransomed them\nboth.\nThere was a small farm in the neighbourhood which the old woman\nproposed to Candide to make a shift with till the company could be\nprovided for in a better manner. Cunegonde did not know she had grown\nugly, for nobody had told her of it; and she reminded Candide of his\npromise in so positive a tone that the good man durst not refuse her. He\ntherefore intimated to the Baron that he intended marrying his sister.\n\"I will not suffer,\" said the Baron, \"such meanness on her part, and\nsuch insolence on yours; I will never be reproached with this scandalous\nthing; my sister's children would never be able to enter the church in\nGermany. No; my sister shall only marry a baron of the empire.\"\nCunegonde flung herself at his feet, and bathed them with her tears;\nstill he was inflexible.\n\"Thou foolish fellow,\" said Candide; \"I have delivered thee out of the\ngalleys, I have paid thy ransom, and thy sister's also; she was a\nscullion, and is very ugly, yet I am so condescending as to marry her;\nand dost thou pretend to oppose the match? I should kill thee again,\nwere I only to consult my anger.\"\n\"Thou mayest kill me again,\" said the Baron, \"but thou shalt not marry\nmy sister, at least whilst I am living.\"\nXXX\nTHE CONCLUSION.\nAt the bottom of his heart Candide had no wish to marry Cunegonde. But\nthe extreme impertinence of the Baron determined him to conclude the\nmatch, and Cunegonde pressed him so strongly that he could not go from\nhis word. He consulted Pangloss, Martin, and the faithful Cacambo.\nPangloss drew up an excellent memorial, wherein he proved that the Baron\nhad no right over his sister, and that according to all the laws of the\nempire, she might marry Candide with her left hand. Martin was for\nthrowing the Baron into the sea; Cacambo decided that it would be better\nto deliver him up again to the captain of the galley, after which they\nthought to send him back to the General Father of the Order at Rome by\nthe first ship. This advice was well received, the old woman approved\nit; they said not a word to his sister; the thing was executed for a\nlittle money, and they had the double pleasure of entrapping a Jesuit,\nand punishing the pride of a German baron.\nIt is natural to imagine that after so many disasters Candide married,\nand living with the philosopher Pangloss, the philosopher Martin, the\nprudent Cacambo, and the old woman, having besides brought so many\ndiamonds from the country of the ancient Incas, must have led a very\nhappy life. But he was so much imposed upon by the Jews that he had\nnothing left except his small farm; his wife became uglier every day,\nmore peevish and unsupportable; the old woman was infirm and even more\nfretful than Cunegonde. Cacambo, who worked in the garden, and took\nvegetables for sale to Constantinople, was fatigued with hard work, and\ncursed his destiny. Pangloss was in despair at not shining in some\nGerman university. For Martin, he was firmly persuaded that he would be\nas badly off elsewhere, and therefore bore things patiently. Candide,\nMartin, and Pangloss sometimes disputed about morals and metaphysics.\nThey often saw passing under the windows of their farm boats full of\nEffendis, Pashas, and Cadis, who were going into banishment to Lemnos,\nMitylene, or Erzeroum. And they saw other Cadis, Pashas, and Effendis\ncoming to supply the place of the exiles, and afterwards exiled in their\nturn. They saw heads decently impaled for presentation to the Sublime\nPorte. Such spectacles as these increased the number of their\ndissertations; and when they did not dispute time hung so heavily upon\ntheir hands, that one day the old woman ventured to say to them:\n\"I want to know which is worse, to be ravished a hundred times by negro\npirates, to have a buttock cut off, to run the gauntlet among the\nBulgarians, to be whipped and hanged at an _auto-da-f\u00e9_, to be\ndissected, to row in the galleys--in short, to go through all the\nmiseries we have undergone, or to stay here and have nothing to do?\"\n\"It is a great question,\" said Candide.\nThis discourse gave rise to new reflections, and Martin especially\nconcluded that man was born to live either in a state of distracting\ninquietude or of lethargic disgust. Candide did not quite agree to that,\nbut he affirmed nothing. Pangloss owned that he had always suffered\nhorribly, but as he had once asserted that everything went wonderfully\nwell, he asserted it still, though he no longer believed it.\nWhat helped to confirm Martin in his detestable principles, to stagger\nCandide more than ever, and to puzzle Pangloss, was that one day they\nsaw Paquette and Friar Girofl\u00e9e land at the farm in extreme misery. They\nhad soon squandered their three thousand piastres, parted, were\nreconciled, quarrelled again, were thrown into gaol, had escaped, and\nFriar Girofl\u00e9e had at length become Turk. Paquette continued her trade\nwherever she went, but made nothing of it.\n\"I foresaw,\" said Martin to Candide, \"that your presents would soon be\ndissipated, and only make them the more miserable. You have rolled in\nmillions of money, you and Cacambo; and yet you are not happier than\nFriar Girofl\u00e9e and Paquette.\"\n\"Ha!\" said Pangloss to Paquette, \"Providence has then brought you\namongst us again, my poor child! Do you know that you cost me the tip of\nmy nose, an eye, and an ear, as you may see? What a world is this!\"\nAnd now this new adventure set them philosophising more than ever.\nIn the neighbourhood there lived a very famous Dervish who was esteemed\nthe best philosopher in all Turkey, and they went to consult him.\nPangloss was the speaker.\n\"Master,\" said he, \"we come to beg you to tell why so strange an animal\nas man was made.\"\n\"With what meddlest thou?\" said the Dervish; \"is it thy business?\"\n\"But, reverend father,\" said Candide, \"there is horrible evil in this\nworld.\"\n\"What signifies it,\" said the Dervish, \"whether there be evil or good?\nWhen his highness sends a ship to Egypt, does he trouble his head\nwhether the mice on board are at their ease or not?\"\n\"What, then, must we do?\" said Pangloss.\n\"Hold your tongue,\" answered the Dervish.\n\"I was in hopes,\" said Pangloss, \"that I should reason with you a little\nabout causes and effects, about the best of possible worlds, the origin\nof evil, the nature of the soul, and the pre-established harmony.\"\nAt these words, the Dervish shut the door in their faces.\nDuring this conversation, the news was spread that two Viziers and the\nMufti had been strangled at Constantinople, and that several of their\nfriends had been impaled. This catastrophe made a great noise for some\nhours. Pangloss, Candide, and Martin, returning to the little farm, saw\na good old man taking the fresh air at his door under an orange bower.\nPangloss, who was as inquisitive as he was argumentative, asked the old\nman what was the name of the strangled Mufti.\n\"I do not know,\" answered the worthy man, \"and I have not known the name\nof any Mufti, nor of any Vizier. I am entirely ignorant of the event you\nmention; I presume in general that they who meddle with the\nadministration of public affairs die sometimes miserably, and that they\ndeserve it; but I never trouble my head about what is transacting at\nConstantinople; I content myself with sending there for sale the fruits\nof the garden which I cultivate.\"\nHaving said these words, he invited the strangers into his house; his\ntwo sons and two daughters presented them with several sorts of sherbet,\nwhich they made themselves, with Kaimak enriched with the candied-peel\nof citrons, with oranges, lemons, pine-apples, pistachio-nuts, and Mocha\ncoffee unadulterated with the bad coffee of Batavia or the American\nislands. After which the two daughters of the honest Mussulman perfumed\nthe strangers' beards.\n\"You must have a vast and magnificent estate,\" said Candide to the Turk.\n\"I have only twenty acres,\" replied the old man; \"I and my children\ncultivate them; our labour preserves us from three great\nevils--weariness, vice, and want.\"\nCandide, on his way home, made profound reflections on the old man's\nconversation.\n\"This honest Turk,\" said he to Pangloss and Martin, \"seems to be in a\nsituation far preferable to that of the six kings with whom we had the\nhonour of supping.\"\n\"Grandeur,\" said Pangloss, \"is extremely dangerous according to the\ntestimony of philosophers. For, in short, Eglon, King of Moab, was\nassassinated by Ehud; Absalom was hung by his hair, and pierced with\nthree darts; King Nadab, the son of Jeroboam, was killed by Baasa; King\nEla by Zimri; Ahaziah by Jehu; Athaliah by Jehoiada; the Kings\nJehoiakim, Jeconiah, and Zedekiah, were led into captivity. You know how\nperished Croesus, Astyages, Darius, Dionysius of Syracuse, Pyrrhus,\nPerseus, Hannibal, Jugurtha, Ariovistus, C\u00e6sar, Pompey, Nero, Otho,\nVitellius, Domitian, Richard II. of England, Edward II., Henry VI.,\nRichard III., Mary Stuart, Charles I., the three Henrys of France, the\nEmperor Henry IV.! You know----\"\n\"I know also,\" said Candide, \"that we must cultivate our garden.\"\n\"You are right,\" said Pangloss, \"for when man was first placed in the\nGarden of Eden, he was put there _ut operaretur eum_, that he might\ncultivate it; which shows that man was not born to be idle.\"\n\"Let us work,\" said Martin, \"without disputing; it is the only way to\nrender life tolerable.\"\nThe whole little society entered into this laudable design, according to\ntheir different abilities. Their little plot of land produced plentiful\ncrops. Cunegonde was, indeed, very ugly, but she became an excellent\npastry cook; Paquette worked at embroidery; the old woman looked after\nthe linen. They were all, not excepting Friar Girofl\u00e9e, of some service\nor other; for he made a good joiner, and became a very honest man.\nPangloss sometimes said to Candide:\n\"There is a concatenation of events in this best of all possible worlds:\nfor if you had not been kicked out of a magnificent castle for love of\nMiss Cunegonde: if you had not been put into the Inquisition: if you had\nnot walked over America: if you had not stabbed the Baron: if you had\nnot lost all your sheep from the fine country of El Dorado: you would\nnot be here eating preserved citrons and pistachio-nuts.\"\n\"All that is very well,\" answered Candide, \"but let us cultivate our\ngarden.\"\nFOOTNOTES:\n[1] P. 2. The name Pangloss is derived from two Greek words signifying\n\"all\" and \"language.\"\n[2] P. 8. The Abares were a tribe of Tartars settled on the shores of\nthe Danube, who later dwelt in part of Circassia.\n[3] P. 15. Venereal disease was said to have been first brought from\nHispaniola, in the West Indies, by some followers of Columbus who were\nlater employed in the siege of Naples. From this latter circumstance it\nwas at one time known as the Neapolitan disease.\n[4] P. 19. The great earthquake of Lisbon happened on the first of\nNovember, 1755.\n[5] P. 20. Such was the aversion of the Japanese to the Christian faith\nthat they compelled Europeans trading with their islands to trample on\nthe cross, renounce all marks of Christianity, and swear that it was not\ntheir religion. See chap. xi. of the voyage to Laputa in Swift's\n_Gulliver's Travels_.\n[6] P. 23. This _auto-da-f\u00e9_ actually took place, some months after the\nearthquake, on June 20, 1756.\n[7] P. 23. The rejection of bacon convicting them, of course, of being\nJews, and therefore fitting victims for an _auto-da-f\u00e9_.\n[8] P. 24. The _San-benito_ was a kind of loose over-garment painted\nwith flames, figures of devils, the victim's own portrait, etc., worn by\npersons condemned to death by the Inquisition when going to the stake on\nthe occasion of an _auto-da-f\u00e9_. Those who expressed repentance for\ntheir errors wore a garment of the same kind covered with flames\ndirected downwards, while that worn by Jews, sorcerers, and renegades\nbore a St. Andrew's cross before and behind.\n[9] P. 26. \"This Notre-Dame is of wood; every year she weeps on the day\nof her _f\u00eate_, and the people weep also. One day the preacher, seeing a\ncarpenter with dry eyes, asked him how it was that he did not dissolve\nin tears when the Holy Virgin wept. 'Ah, my reverend father,' replied\nhe, 'it is I who refastened her in her niche yesterday. I drove three\ngreat nails through her behind; it is then she would have wept if she\nhad been able.'\"--Voltaire, _M\u00e9langes_.\n[10] P. 42. The following posthumous note of Voltaire's was first added\nto M. Beuchot's edition of his works issued in 1829; \"See the extreme\ndiscretion of the author; there has not been up to the present any Pope\nnamed Urban X.; he feared to give a bastard to a known Pope. What\ncircumspection! What delicacy of conscience!\" The last Pope Urban was\nthe eighth, and he died in 1644.\n[11] P. 45. Muley-Ismael was Emperor of Morocco from 1672 to 1727, and\nwas a notoriously cruel tyrant.\n[12] P. 47. \"Oh, what a misfortune to be an eunuch!\"\n[13] P. 48. Carlo Broschi, called Farinelli, an Italian singer, born at\nNaples in 1705, without being exactly Minister, governed Spain under\nFerdinand VI.; he died in 1782. He has been made one of the chief\npersons in one of the comic operas of MM. Auber and Scribe.\n[14] P. 53. Jean Robeck, a Swede, who was born in 1672, will be found\nmentioned in Rousseau's _Nouvelle H\u00e9lo\u00efse_. He drowned himself in the\nWeser at Bremen in 1729, and was the author of a Latin treatise on\nvoluntary death, first printed in 1735.\n[15] P. 60. A spontoon was a kind of half-pike, a military weapon\ncarried by officers of infantry and used as a medium for signalling\norders to the regiment.\n[16] P. 64. Later Voltaire substituted the name of the Father Croust for\nthat of Didrie. Of Croust he said in the _Dictionnaire Philosophique_\nthat he was \"the most brutal of the Society.\"\n[17] P. 68. By the _Journal of Trevoux_ Voltaire meant a critical\nperiodical printed by the Jesuits at Trevoux under the title of\n_M\u00e9moires pour servir \u00e0 l'Historie des Sciences et des Beaux-Arts_. It\nexisted from 1701 until 1767, during which period its title underwent\nmany changes.\n[18] P. 76. It has been suggested that Voltaire, in speaking of red\nsheep, referred to the llama, a South American ruminant allied to the\ncamel. These animals are sometimes of a reddish colour, and were notable\nas pack-carriers and for their fleetness.\n[19] P. 78. The first English translator curiously gives \"a tourene of\nbouilli that weighed two hundred pounds,\" as the equivalent of \"_un\ncontour bouilli qui pesait deux cent livres_.\" The French editor of the\n1869 reprint points out that the South American vulture, or condor, is\nmeant; the name of this bird, it may be added, is taken from \"_cuntur_,\"\nthat given it by the aborigines.\n[20] P. 90. Spanish half-crowns.\n[21] P. 99. _Socinians_; followers of the teaching of Lalius and Faustus\nSocinus (16th century), which denied the doctrine of the Trinity, the\ndeity of Christ, the personality of the devil, the native and total\ndepravity of man, the vicarious atonement and eternal punishment. The\nSocinians are now represented by the Unitarians. _Manicheans_; followers\nof Manes or Manich\u00e6us (3rd century), a Persian who maintained that there\nare two principles, the one good and the other evil, each equally\npowerful in the government of the world.\n[22] P. 107. In the 1759 editions, in place of the long passage in\nbrackets from here to page 215, there was only the following: \"'Sir,'\nsaid the Perigordian Abb\u00e9 to him, 'have you noticed that young person\nwho has so roguish a face and so fine a figure? You may have her for ten\nthousand francs a month, and fifty thousand crowns in diamonds.' 'I have\nonly a day or two to give her,' answered Candide, 'because I have a\nrendezvous at Venice.' In the evening after supper the insinuating\nPerigordian redoubled his politeness and attentions.\"\n[23] P. 108. The play referred to is supposed to be \"Le Comte d'Essex,\"\nby Thomas Corneille.\n[24] P. 108. In France actors were at one time looked upon as\nexcommunicated persons, not worthy of burial in holy ground or with\nChristian rites. In 1730 the \"honours of sepulture\" were refused to\nMademoiselle Lecouvreur (doubtless the Miss Monime of this passage).\nVoltaire's miscellaneous works contain a paper on the matter.\n[25] P. 109. \u00c9lie-Catherine Fr\u00e9ron was a French critic (1719-1776) who\nincurred the enmity of Voltaire. In 1752 Fr\u00e9ron, in _Lettres sur\nquelques \u00e9crits du temps_, wrote pointedly of Voltaire as one who chose\nto be all things to all men, and Voltaire retaliated by references such\nas these in _Candide_.\n[26] P. 111. Gabriel Gauchat (1709-1779), French ecclesiastical writer,\nwas author of a number of works on religious subjects.\n[27] P. 112. Nicholas Charles Joseph Trublet (1697-1770) was a French\nwriter whose criticism of Voltaire was revenged in passages such as this\none in _Candide_, and one in the _Pauvre Diable_ beginning:\nL'abb\u00e9 Trublet avait alors le rage\nD'\u00eatre \u00e0 Paris un petit personage.\n[28] P. 120. Damiens, who attempted the life of Louis XV. in 1757, was\nborn at Arras, capital of Artois (Atr\u00e9batie).\n[29] P. 120. On May 14, 1610, Ravaillac assassinated Henry VI.\n[30] P. 120. On December 27, 1594, Jean Ch\u00e2tel attempted to assassinate\nHenry IV.\n[31] P. 122. This same curiously inept criticism of the war which cost\nFrance her American provinces occurs in Voltaire's _Memoirs_, wherein he\nsays, \"In 1756 England made a piratical war upon France for some acres\nof snow.\" See also his _Pr\u00e9cis du Si\u00e8cle de Louis_ XV.\n[32] P. 123. Admiral Byng was shot on March 14, 1757.\n[33] P. 129. Commenting upon this passage, M. Sarcey says admirably:\n\"All is there! In those ten lines Voltaire has gathered all the griefs\nand all the terrors of these creatures; the picture is admirable for its\ntruth and power! But do you not feel the pity and sympathy of the\npainter? Here irony becomes sad, and in a way an avenger. Voltaire cries\nout with horror against the society which throws some of its members\ninto such an abyss. He has his 'Bartholomew' fever; we tremble with him\nthrough contagion.\"\n[34] P. 142. The following particulars of the six monarchs may prove not\nuninteresting. Achmet III. (_b._ 1673, _d._ 1739) was dethroned in 1730.\nIvan VI. (_b._ 1740, _d._ 1762) was dethroned in 1741. Charles Edward\nStuart, the Pretender (_b._ 1720, _d._ 1788). Auguste III. (_b._ 1696,\n_d._ 1763). Stanislaus (_b._ 1682, _d._ 1766). Theodore (_b._ 1690, _d._\n1755). It will be observed that, although quite impossible for the six\nkings ever to have met, five of them might have been made to do so\nwithout any anachronism.\n[35] P. 149. Fran\u00e7ois Leopold Ragotsky (1676-1735).\n*       *       *       *       *\n+------------------------------------------------------------+\n| Typographical errors corrected in text:                    |\n|                                                            |\n| Page xiv: Chapter XIII heading in Table of Contents        |\n| amended to match chapter heading on page 54.               |\n| Page 2: metaphysicotheo-logico-cosmolo-nigology            |\n| amended to metaphysico-theologico-cosmolo-nigology.        |\n| Page 158: Liebnitz amended to Leibnitz.                    |\n| Page 168: perserved amended to preserved.                  |\n| Page 172: rougish amended to roguish; crows amended to     |\n| crowns.                                                    |\n|                                                            |\n| Where there is an equal number of instances of a word      |\n| being hyphenated and unhyphenated, both versions           |\n| of the word have been retained: dung-hill/dunghill;        |\n| and new-comers/newcomers.                                  |\n|                                                            |\n| A single footnote on page 90 has been moved                |\n| to the endnotes, and the notes numbers re-indexed.
