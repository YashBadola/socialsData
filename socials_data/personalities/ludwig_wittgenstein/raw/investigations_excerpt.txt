The problems are solved, not by giving new information, but by arranging what we have known since long.
Philosophy is a battle against the bewitchment of our intelligence by means of language.
A picture held us captive. And we could not get outside it, for it lay in our language and language seemed to repeat it to us inexorably.
If a lion could speak, we could not understand him.
If I have exhausted the justifications, I have reached bedrock and my spade is turned. Then I am inclined to say: 'This is simply what I do.'
The face is the soul of the body.
So in the end, when one is doing philosophy, one gets to the point where one would like just to emit an inarticulate sound.
Language is a labyrinth of paths. You approach from one side and know your way about; you approach the same place from another side and no longer know your way about.
The meaning of a word is its use in the language.
A nothing will serve just as well as a something about which nothing could be said.
Philosophy may in no way interfere with the actual use of language; it can in the end only describe it. For it cannot give any foundation either. It leaves everything as it is.
For philosophical problems arise when language goes on holiday.
The fact that we cannot write down all the digits of pi is not a human shortcoming, as mathematicians sometimes think.
What people accept as justification shows how they think and live.
The philosopher's treatment of a question is like the treatment of an illness.
To imagine a language means to imagine a form of life.
What is internal is hidden from us. The future is hidden from us. But does the astronomer think like this when he calculates an eclipse of the sun?
And nothing is more wrong-headed than calling meaning a mental activity!
Our investigation is a grammatical one. Such an investigation sheds light on our problem by clearing misunderstandings away.
