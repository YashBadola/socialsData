Preface

Not only in the world of commerce but also in the world of ideas our age is putting on a big clearance sale. Everything can be had at such a bargain that it is doubtful whether in the end there is anyone who will want to bid. Every speculative price-fixer who conscientiously directs attention to the significant march of modern philosophy, every private docent, tutor, and student, every crofter and cottar in philosophy, is not stopping at doubting everything but is going further. Perhaps it would be premature and untimely to ask them where they are going, but it is pardonable to take for granted that they have doubted everything, since otherwise it would be queer for them to be going further. This movement they have all made is of such a nature that they have settled it among themselves, and so they do not like to have anyone who is a stickler for etiquette, anyone who has a little timidity about making such a huge movement, approach them with the request that they explain how they did it. They would rather explain it, they say, in a new book.

The present author is by no means a philosopher. He is, poetically and elegantly, an amateur writer who neither writes the system nor promises the system, who neither subscribes to the system nor ascribes the system to himself. He writes because to him it is a luxury that becomes the more agreeable and more evident the fewer there are who buy and read what he writes. He can easily foresee his fate in an age that has crossed out passion in order to serve science, in an age when an author who wants to have readers must take care to write in such a way that the book can be easily leafed through during the afternoon nap and be as polite as the gardener's lad in the advertisement who with hat in hand holds out a tray of rhubarb to the potential customer. He foresees his fate: to be completely ignored.

...

Faith is precisely this paradox, that the single individual is higher than the universal, yet in such a way, be it observed, that the movement repeats itself, and that consequently the single individual, after having been in the universal, now as the single individual isolates himself as higher than the universal. If this is not faith, then Abraham is lost, then faith has never existed in the world... because it has always existed. For if the ethical (i.e., the moral) is the highest thing, and if nothing incommensurable remains in man in any other way but as the evil (i.e., the particular which has to be expressed in the universal), then one needs no other categories than those which the Greek philosophy possessed or which can be deduced from them by the most consistent thought. But Hegel should not conceal this, for, after all, he has studied Greek philosophy.
