{"text": "The art of war is of vital importance to the State.\nIt is a matter of life and death, a road either to safety or to ruin. Hence it is a subject of inquiry which can on no account be neglected.\nThe art of war, then, is governed by five constant factors, to be taken into account in one's deliberations, when seeking to determine the conditions obtaining in the field.\nThese are: (1) The Moral Law; (2) Heaven; (3) Earth; (4) The Commander; (5) Method and Discipline.\nAll warfare is based on deception.\nHence, when able to attack, we must seem unable; when using our forces, we must seem inactive; when we are near, we must make the enemy believe we are far away; when far away, we must make him believe we are near.\nHold out baits to entice the enemy. Feign disorder, and crush him.\nIf he is secure at all points, be prepared for him. If he is in superior strength, evade him.\nIf your opponent is of choleric temper, seek to irritate him. Pretend to be weak, that he may grow arrogant.\nIf he is taking his ease, give him no rest. If his forces are united, separate them.\nAttack him where he is unprepared, appear where you are not expected.\nThe supreme art of war is to subdue the enemy without fighting.\nIf you know the enemy and know yourself, you need not fear the result of a hundred battles. If you know yourself but not the enemy, for every victory gained you will also suffer a defeat. If you know neither the enemy nor yourself, you will succumb in every battle.\nVictorious warriors win first and then go to war, while defeated warriors go to war first and then seek to win.\nIn the midst of chaos, there is also opportunity.", "source": "art_of_war.txt"}
