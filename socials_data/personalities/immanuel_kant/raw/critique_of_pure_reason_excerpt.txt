Introduction

I. Of the difference between Pure and Empirical Knowledge

   That all our knowledge begins with experience there can be no doubt.
   For how is it possible that the faculty of cognition should be awakened
   into exercise otherwise than by means of objects which affect our
   senses, and partly of themselves produce representations, partly rouse
   our powers of understanding into activity, to compare to connect, or to
   separate these, and so to convert the raw material of our sensuous
   impressions into a knowledge of objects, which is called experience? In
   respect of time, therefore, no knowledge of ours is antecedent to
   experience, but begins with it.

   But, though all our knowledge begins with experience, it by no means
   follows that all arises out of experience. For, on the contrary, it is
   quite possible that our empirical knowledge is a compound of that which
   we receive through impressions, and that which the faculty of cognition
   supplies from itself (sensuous impressions giving merely the occasion),
   an addition which we cannot distinguish from the original element given
   by sense, till long practice has made us attentive to, and skilful in
   separating it. It is, therefore, a question which requires close
   investigation, and not to be answered at first sight, whether there
   exists a knowledge altogether independent of experience, and even of
   all sensuous impressions? Knowledge of this kind is called à priori, in
   contradistinction to empirical knowledge, which has its sources à
   posteriori, that is, in experience.

   But the expression, “à priori,” is not as yet definite enough
   adequately to indicate the whole meaning of the question above started.
   For, in speaking of knowledge which has its sources in experience, we
   are wont to say, that this or that may be known à priori, because we do
   not derive this knowledge immediately from experience, but from a
   general rule, which, however, we have itself borrowed from experience.
   Thus, if a man undermined his house, we say, “he might know à priori
   that it would have fallen;” that is, he needed not to have waited for
   the experience that it did actually fall. But still, à priori, he could
   not know even this much. For, that bodies are heavy, and, consequently,
   that they fall when their supports are taken away, must have been known
   to him previously, by means of experience.

   By the term “knowledge à priori,” therefore, we shall in the sequel
   understand, not such as is independent of this or that kind of
   experience, but such as is absolutely so of all experience. Opposed to
   this is empirical knowledge, or that which is possible only à
   posteriori, that is, through experience. Knowledge à priori is either
   pure or impure. Pure knowledge à priori is that with which no empirical
   element is mixed up. For example, the proposition, “Every change has a
   cause,” is a proposition à priori, but impure, because change is a
   conception which can only be derived from experience.

II. The Human Intellect, even in an Unphilosophical State, is in Possession
of Certain Cognitions “à priori”.

   The question now is as to a criterion, by which we may securely
   distinguish a pure from an empirical cognition. Experience no doubt
   teaches us that this or that object is constituted in such and such a
   manner, but not that it could not possibly exist otherwise. Now, in the
   first place, if we have a proposition which contains the idea of
   necessity in its very conception, it is priori. If, moreover, it is not
   derived from any other proposition, unless from one equally involving
   the idea of necessity, it is absolutely priori. Secondly, an empirical
   judgement never exhibits strict and absolute, but only assumed and
   comparative universality (by induction); therefore, the most we can say
   is—so far as we have hitherto observed, there is no exception to this
   or that rule. If, on the other hand, a judgement carries with it strict
   and absolute universality, that is, admits of no possible exception, it
   is not derived from experience, but is valid absolutely à priori.

   Empirical universality is, therefore, only an arbitrary extension of
   validity, from that which may be predicated of a proposition valid in
   most cases, to that which is asserted of a proposition which holds good
   in all; as, for example, in the affirmation, “All bodies are heavy.”
   When, on the contrary, strict universality characterizes a judgement,
   it necessarily indicates another peculiar source of knowledge, namely,
   a faculty of cognition à priori. Necessity and strict universality,
   therefore, are infallible tests for distinguishing pure from empirical
   knowledge, and are inseparably connected with each other. But as in the
   use of these criteria the empirical limitation is sometimes more easily
   detected than the contingency of the judgement, or the unlimited
   universality which we attach to a judgement is often a more convincing
   proof than its necessity, it may be advisable to use the criteria
   separately, each being by itself infallible.

   Now, that in the sphere of human cognition we have judgements which are
   necessary, and in the strictest sense universal, consequently pure à
   priori, it will be an easy matter to show. If we desire an example from
   the sciences, we need only take any proposition in mathematics. If we
   cast our eyes upon the commonest operations of the understanding, the
   proposition, “Every change must have a cause,” will amply serve our
   purpose. In the latter case, indeed, the conception of a cause so
   plainly involves the conception of a necessity of connection with an
   effect, and of a strict universality of the law, that the very notion
   of a cause would entirely disappear, were we to derive it, like Hume,
   from a frequent association of what happens with that which precedes;
   and the habit thence originating of connecting representations—the
   necessity inherent in the judgement being therefore merely subjective.
   Besides, without seeking for such examples of principles existing à
   priori in cognition, we might easily show that such principles are the
   indispensable basis of the possibility of experience itself, and
   consequently prove their existence à priori. For whence could our
   experience itself acquire certainty, if all the rules on which it
   depends were themselves empirical, and consequently fortuitous? No one,
   therefore, can admit the validity of the use of such rules as first
   principles. But, for the present, we may content ourselves with having
   established the fact, that we do possess and exercise a faculty of pure
   à priori cognition; and, secondly, with having pointed out the proper
   tests of such cognition, namely, universality and necessity.

   Not only in judgements, however, but even in conceptions, is an à
   priori origin manifest. For example, if we take away by degrees from
   our conceptions of a body all that can be referred to mere sensuous
   experience—colour, hardness or softness, weight, even
   impenetrability—the body will then vanish; but the space which it
   occupied still remains, and this it is utterly impossible to annihilate
   in thought. Again, if we take away, in like manner, from our empirical
   conception of any object, corporeal or incorporeal, all properties
   which mere experience has taught us to connect with it, still we cannot
   think away those through which we cogitate it as substance, or adhering
   to substance, although our conception of substance is more determined
   than that of an object. Compelled, therefore, by that necessity with
   which the conception of substance forces itself upon us, we must
   confess that it has its seat in our faculty of cognition à priori.
