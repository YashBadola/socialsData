{"text": "The Sickness Unto Death\nA Christian Psychological Exposition for Upbuilding and Awakening\nPart First\nThe Sickness Unto Death is Despair\nI. That Despair is the Sickness Unto Death\nA. Despair is a Sickness in the Spirit, in the Self, and so it may have a Triple Form: in Despair at not being Conscious of having a Self (Despair Improperly so called); in Despair at not willing to be Oneself; in Despair at willing to be Oneself.\nMan is spirit. But what is spirit? Spirit is the self. But what is the self? The self is a relation that relates itself to itself or is the relation's relating itself to itself in the relation; the self is not the relation but that the relation relates itself to itself. Man is a synthesis of the infinite and the finite, of the temporal and the eternal, of freedom and necessity, in short, a synthesis. A synthesis is a relation between two. Considered in this way, man is still not a self.\nIn the relation between two, the relation is the third as a negative unity, and the two relate to the relation and in the relation to the relation; thus under the qualification of the psychical the relation between the psychical and the physical is a relation. But that the relation relates itself to itself is the positive third, and this is the self.\nSuch a relation that relates itself to itself, a self, must either have established itself or have been established by another.\nIf the relation that relates itself to itself has been established by another, then the relation is indeed the third, but this relation, the third, is yet again a relation and relates itself to that which established the entire relation.\nThe human self is such a derived, established relation, a relation that relates itself to itself and in relating itself to itself relates itself to another. This is why there can be two forms of despair in the strict sense. If a human self had itself established itself, then there could be only one form: not to will to be oneself, to will to get rid of oneself, but there could be no question of despairfully willing to be oneself. This formula is the expression for the total dependence of the relation (the self), the expression for the fact that the self cannot of itself attain and remain in equilibrium and rest by itself, but only by relating itself to that Power which constituted the whole relation.\nDespair is the sickness unto death.\nThe concept of the sickness unto death must be understood in a peculiar sense. Literally it means a sickness the end of which is death, and death is the end of all sicknesses. But in a Christian sense death is by no means the end of all, and hence there is an infinite difference between the sickness unto death in the strict sense and the sickness of which the end is death.\nThis sickness in the self is the dying death. For to die signifies that it is all over, but to die the death means to experience dying; and if one experiences it for a single moment, one thereby experiences it forever. If one might die of despair as one dies of a sickness, then the eternal in him, the self, must be capable of dying in the same sense that the body dies of sickness. But this is an impossibility; the dying of despair transforms itself constantly into a living. The despairing man cannot die; no more than \"the dagger can slay thoughts\" can despair consume the eternal thing, the self, which is the ground of despair, whose worm dieth not and whose fire is not quenched.", "source": "sickness_unto_death.txt"}
{"text": "Preface\nNot only in the world of commerce but also in the world of ideas our age is putting on a veritable clearance sale. Everything can be had so dirt cheap that one begins to wonder whether in the end anyone will want to make a bid. Every speculative price-fixer who conscientiously directs attention to the significant march of modern philosophy, every privatdocent, tutor, and student, every crofter and cottar in philosophy, is not stopping at doubting everything but is going further. Perhaps it would be premature and untimely to ask them where they are going, but it is pardonable to take for granted that they have doubted everything, since otherwise it would be queer for them to go further. Having made this movement, they have perhaps landed at the system.\nProblem I: Is there such a thing as a Teleological Suspension of the Ethical?\nThe ethical as such is the universal, it applies to everyone, which may be expressed from another point of view by saying that it applies every instant. It rests immanent in itself, has nothing without itself which is its telos, but is itself telos for everything outside it, and when this has been incorporated by the ethical it can go no further. Conceived immediately as physical and psychical, the particular individual is the individual who has his telos in the universal, and his ethical task is to express himself constantly in it, to abolish his particularity in order to become the universal. As soon as the individual would assert himself as the particular over against the universal, he sins, and only by recognizing this can he again reconcile himself with the universal.\nFaith is precisely this paradox, that the individual as the particular is higher than the universal, is justified over against it, is not subordinate but superior\u2014yet in such a way, be it observed, that it is the particular individual who, after he has been subordinated as the particular to the universal, now through the universal becomes the individual who as the particular is superior to the universal, for the fact that the individual as the particular stands in an absolute relation to the absolute. This position cannot be mediated, for all mediation comes about precisely by virtue of the universal; it is and remains to all eternity a paradox, inaccessible to thought.\nIf this is not the case, then Abraham is lost, then faith has never existed in the world precisely because it has always existed. For if the ethical (i.e., the moral) is the highest thing, and if nothing incommensurable remains in man in any other way but as the evil (i.e., the particular which has to be expressed in the universal), then one needs no other categories than those which the Greek philosophy possessed or which can be deduced from them by the most consistent thinking. But if the ethical is the highest thing, then Abraham is lost.\nBut now when the ethical is thus explained, can it not be said that there is a teleological suspension of it? You can certainly say that in the story of Abraham. Abraham acts by virtue of the absurd, or by virtue of the fact that for God all things are possible. The tragic hero renounces himself to express the universal, the knight of faith renounces the universal in order to become the individual.", "source": "fear_and_trembling.txt"}
{"text": "Diapsalmata\nWhat is a poet? An unhappy man who in his heart harbors a deep anguish, but whose lips are so fashioned that the sighs and cries which pass over them are transformed into ravishing music. His fate is like that of the unfortunate victims whom the tyrant Phalaris imprisoned in a brazen bull, and slowly tortured over a steady fire; their cries could not reach the tyrant's ears so as to strike terror into his heart; when they reached his ears they sounded like sweet music.\nI do not care for anything. I do not care to ride, for the exercise is too violent. I do not care to walk, for it is too strenuous. I do not care to lie down, for I should either have to remain lying, and I do not care to do that, or I should have to get up again, and I do not care to do that either. Summa summarum: I do not care at all.\nThere are, as is known, insects that die in the moment of fertilization. So it is with all joy: life's highest, most splendid moment of enjoyment is accompanied by death.\nMy life is like an eternal night; when will the day dawn? When will the sun rise?\nIt happened that a fire broke out backstage in a theater. The clown came out to inform the public. They thought it was a jest and applauded. He repeated it; the acclaim was even greater. I think that's just how the world will come to an end: to general applause from wits who believe it's a joke.\nI have the courage, I believe, to doubt everything; I have the courage, I believe, to fight with everything; but I have not the courage to know anything, not the courage to possess, to own anything. Most people complain that the world is so prosaic, that life is not like a romance, where opportunities are always so favorable. I complain that life is not like a romance where one has hard-hearted parents and nixies and trolls to fight, and enchanted princesses to free. What are all such enemies taken together compared with the pale, bloodless, tenacious, nocturnal shapes with which I fight and to which I give life and being?\nLet others complain that the age is wicked; my complaint is that it is paltry; for it lacks passion. Men's thoughts are thin and flimsy like lace, they are themselves pitiable like the lacemakers. The thoughts of their hearts are too paltry to be sinful. For a worm it might be regarded as a sin to harbor such thoughts, but not for a being made in the image of God. Their lusts are dull and sluggish, their passions sleepy. They do their duty, these shopkeeping souls, but they clip the coin a little...\nMy sorrow is my castle, which like an eagle's nest is built high up on the mountain peaks among the clouds; no one can storm it. From it I fly down into reality and seize my prey; but I do not remain down there, I bring my prey home; and this prey is a picture I weave into the tapestries of my palace.\nI divide my time as follows: half the time I sleep, the other half I dream. I never dream when I sleep, for that would be a pity, for sleeping is the highest genius.", "source": "either_or_diapsalmata.txt"}
