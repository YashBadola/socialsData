{"text": "1. \"Cum augustine infans eram...\" Augustine, in his Confessions, gives us a particular picture of the essence of human language. It is this: the individual words in language name objects\u2014sentences are combinations of such names. In this picture of language we find the roots of the following idea: Every word has a meaning. This meaning is correlated with the word. It is the object for which the word stands.\n2. That philosophical concept of meaning has its place in a primitive idea of the way language functions. But one can also say that it is the idea of a language more primitive than ours. Let us imagine a language for which the description given by Augustine is right. The language is meant to serve for communication between a builder A and an assistant B. A is building with building-stones: there are blocks, pillars, slabs and beams. B has to pass the stones, and that in the order in which A needs them. For this purpose they use a language consisting of the words \"block\", \"pillar\", \"slab\", \"beam\". A calls them out; \u2014B brings the stone which he has learnt to bring at such-and-such a call. \u2014Conceive this as a complete primitive language.\n3. Augustine, we might say, does describe a system of communication; only not everything that we call language is this system. And one has to say this in many cases where the question arises \"Is this an appropriate description or not?\" The answer is: \"Yes, it is appropriate, but only for this narrowly circumscribed region, not for the whole of what you were claiming to describe.\"\n7. We can also think of the whole process of using words in (2) as one of those games by means of which children learn their native language. I will call these games \"language-games\" and will sometimes speak of a primitive language as a language-game. And the processes of naming the stones and of repeating words after someone might also be called language-games. Think of much of the use of words in games like ring-a-ring-a-roses. I shall also call the whole, consisting of language and the actions into which it is woven, the \"language-game\".\n11. Think of the tools in a tool-box: there is a hammer, pliers, a saw, a screw-driver, a rule, a glue-pot, glue, nails and screws.\u2014The functions of words are as diverse as the functions of these objects. (And in both cases there are similarities.)\n18. Our language can be seen as an ancient city: a maze of little streets and squares, of old and new houses, and of houses with additions from various periods; and this surrounded by a multitude of new boroughs with straight regular streets and uniform houses.\n23. But how many kinds of sentence are there? Say assertion, question, and command?\u2014There are countless kinds: countless different kinds of use of what we call \"symbols\", \"words\", \"sentences\". And this multiplicity is not something fixed, given once for all; but new types of language, new language-games, as we may say, come into existence, and others become obsolete and get forgotten. (We can get a rough picture of this from the changes in mathematics.)\nHere the term \"language-game\" is meant to bring into prominence the fact that the speaking of language is part of an activity, or of a form of life.\n43. For a large class of cases\u2014though not for all\u2014in which we employ the word \"meaning\" it can be defined thus: the meaning of a word is its use in the language.\n65. Here we come up against the great question that lies behind all these considerations.\u2014For someone might object against me: \"You take the easy way out! You talk about all sorts of language-games, but have nowhere said what the essence of a language-game, and hence of language, is: what is common to all these activities, and what makes them into language or parts of language. So you let yourself off the very part of the investigation that once gave you yourself most headache, the part about the general form of propositions and of language.\"\nAnd this is true.\u2014Instead of producing something common to all that we call language, I am saying that these phenomena have no one thing in common which makes us use the same word for all,\u2014but that they are related to one another in many different ways. And it is because of this relationship, or these relationships, that we call them all \"language\".\n66. Consider for example the proceedings that we call \"games\". I mean board-games, card-games, ball-games, Olympic games, and so on. What is common to them all?\u2014Don't say: \"There must be something common, or they would not be called 'games'\"\u2014but look and see whether there is anything common to all.\u2014For if you look at them you will not see something that is common to all, but similarities, relationships, and a whole series of them at that. To repeat: don't think, but look!\n67. I can think of no better expression to characterize these similarities than \"family resemblances\"; for the various resemblances between members of a family: build, features, colour of eyes, gait, temperament, etc. etc. overlap and criss-cross in the same way.\u2014And I shall say: 'games' form a family.\n293. If I say of myself that it is only from my own case that I know what the word \"pain\" means\u2014must I not say the same of other people too? And how can I generalize the one case so irresponsibly?\nNow someone tells me that he knows what pain is only from his own case!\u2014\u2014Suppose everyone had a box with something in it: we call it a \"beetle\". No one can look into anyone else's box, and everyone says he knows what a beetle is only by looking at his beetle.\u2014Here it would be quite possible for everyone to have something different in his box. One might even imagine such a thing constantly changing.\u2014But suppose the word \"beetle\" had a use in these people's language?\u2014If so it would not be used as the name of a thing. The thing in the box has no place in the language-game at all; not even as a something: for the box might even be empty.\u2014No, one can 'divide through' by the thing in the box; it cancels out, whatever it is. That is to say: if we construe the grammar of the expression of sensation on the model of 'object and designation' the object drops out of consideration as irrelevant.", "source": "investigations.txt"}

In the world everything is as it is and happens as it does happen. In it there is no value\u2014and if there were, it would be of no value.\n6.42 Hence also there can be no ethical propositions. Propositions cannot express something higher.\n6.421 It is clear, however, that ethics cannot be expressed. Ethics are transcendental.
