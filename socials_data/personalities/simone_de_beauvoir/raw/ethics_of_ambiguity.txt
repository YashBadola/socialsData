The life of man is an enterprise of self-destruction; the paradox of existence is that the very condition of our freedom is the ambiguity of our situation. We are both subject and object, freedom and facticity. To wish to forget this ambiguity is to fall into bad faith.

The serious man gets rid of his freedom by claiming to subordinate it to values which would be unconditioned. He imagines that the object has a value in itself and not due to the fact that he chooses it. He becomes a tyrant or a slave to his own seriousness. He takes refuge in the ready-made values of the world, hiding from the terrifying responsibility of creating his own meaning.

But if we accept our freedom, we must also accept the freedom of others. To will oneself free is also to will others free. This is the only justification of our existence. We cannot save the world, but we can refuse to participate in its oppression. The man who seeks to justify his life must want freedom itself absolutely and above everything else.

There is no way to escape the anguish of freedom. We must constantly choose, and in choosing, we define ourselves and the world around us. Action is the only reality; it is not enough to think or to feel—one must act. And this action must be directed towards the liberation of man. The ultimate goal of freedom is the conquest of the future, but this future is not a fixed destiny; it is an open horizon that we must create together.
