Preface

Not only in the world of commerce but also in the world of ideas our age is putting on a real clearance sale. Everything is to be had at such a bargain that it is questionable whether in the end there is anybody who will want to buy.

The Story of Abraham

There was once a man who, already in his childhood, had heard the beautiful story of how God tempted Abraham, and how he withstood the temptation, kept the faith, and a second time received a son against every expectation. When the man grew older, he read the same story with even greater admiration, for life had separated what had been united in the pious simplicity of the child.

Faith is precisely this paradox, that the individual as the particular is higher than the universal, is justified over against it, is not subordinate but superior—yet in such a way, be it observed, that it is the particular individual who, after he has been subordinated as the particular to the universal, now through the universal becomes the individual who as the particular is superior to the universal, for the fact that the individual as the particular stands in an absolute relation to the absolute. This position cannot be mediated, for all mediation comes about precisely by virtue of the universal; it is and remains to all eternity a paradox, inaccessible to thought.
