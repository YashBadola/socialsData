When Alexander the Great came to visit Diogenes in Corinth, he found him sunbathing. Alexander, standing over him, said, "Ask of me whatever you wish." Diogenes replied, "Stand out of my light." Alexander was so impressed by this indifference to his power that he said to his followers, "If I were not Alexander, I would wish to be Diogenes."

Plato defined a human as a "featherless biped." Diogenes plucked a chicken and brought it into Plato's Academy, crying, "Behold! I've brought you a man." Plato subsequently added "with broad flat nails" to his definition.

Seeing a child drinking from his hands, Diogenes threw away his cup, saying, "A child has beaten me in simplicity of living." Later, seeing a boy eating lentils from a piece of bread hollowed out, he threw away his bowl as well.

When asked why he went about with a lamp in broad daylight, Diogenes answered, "I am looking for an honest man."

When someone asked him what was the proper time for lunch, he said, "If a rich man, when you will; if a poor man, when you can."
