{"text": "INTRODUCTION.\nIf my object in these pages were to present a complete scheme of\ncounsels and maxims for the guidance of life, I should have to repeat\nthe numerous rules--some of them excellent--which have been drawn\nup by thinkers of all ages, from Theognis and Solomon[1] down to La\nRochefoucauld; and, in so doing, I should inevitably entail upon the\nreader a vast amount of well-worn commonplace. But the fact is that in\nthis work I make still less claim to exhaust my subject than in any\nother of my writings.\n[Footnote 1: I refer to the proverbs and maxims ascribed, in the Old\nTestament, to the king of that name.]\nAn author who makes no claims to completeness must also, in a great\nmeasure, abandon any attempt at systematic arrangement. For his double\nloss in this respect, the reader may console himself by reflecting\nthat a complete and systematic treatment of such a subject as the\nguidance of life could hardly fail to be a very wearisome business.\nI have simply put down those of my thoughts which appear to be worth\ncommunicating--thoughts which, as far as I know, have not been\nuttered, or, at any rate, not just in the same form, by any one else;\nso that my remarks may be taken as a supplement to what has been\nalready achieved in the immense field.\nHowever, by way of introducing some sort of order into the great\nvariety of matters upon which advice will be given in the following\npages, I shall distribute what I have to say under the following\nheads: (1) general rules; (2) our relation to ourselves; (3) our\nrelation to others; and finally, (4) rules which concern our manner of\nlife and our worldly circumstances. I shall conclude with some remarks\non the changes which the various periods of life produce in us.\nCHAPTER I.\nGENERAL RULES.--SECTION 1.\nThe first and foremost rule for the wise conduct of life seems to me\nto be contained in a view to which Aristotle parenthetically refers in\nthe _Nichomachean Ethics_:[1] [Greek: o phronimoz to alupon dioke e ou\nto aedu] or, as it may be rendered, _not pleasure, but freedom from\npain, is what the wise man will aim at_.\n[Footnote 1: vii. (12) 12.]\nThe truth of this remark turns upon the negative character of\nhappiness,--the fact that pleasure is only the negation of pain, and\nthat pain is the positive element in life. Though I have given a\ndetailed proof of this proposition in my chief work,[1] I may supply\none more illustration of it here, drawn from a circumstance of daily\noccurrence. Suppose that, with the exception of some sore or painful\nspot, we are physically in a sound and healthy condition: the sore of\nthis one spot, will completely absorb our attention, causing us to\nlose the sense of general well-being, and destroying all our comfort\nin life. In the same way, when all our affairs but one turn out as\nwe wish, the single instance in which our aims are frustrated is a\nconstant trouble to us, even though it be something quite trivial. We\nthink a great deal about it, and very little about those other and\nmore important matters in which we have been successful. In both these\ncases what has met with resistance is _the will_; in the one case, as\nit is objectified in the organism, in the other, as it presents\nitself in the struggle of life; and in both, it is plain that the\nsatisfaction of the will consists in nothing else than that it meets\nwith no resistance. It is, therefore, a satisfaction which is not\ndirectly felt; at most, we can become conscious of it only when we\nreflect upon our condition. But that which checks or arrests the will\nis something positive; it proclaims its own presence. All pleasure\nconsists in merely removing this check--in other words, in freeing us\nfrom its action; and hence pleasure is a state which can never last\nvery long.\n[Footnote 1: _Welt als Wille und Vorstellung_. Vol. I., p. 58.]\nThis is the true basis of the above excellent rule quoted from\nAristotle, which bids us direct our aim, not toward securing what is\npleasurable and agreeable in life, but toward avoiding, as far as\npossible, its innumerable evils. If this were not the right course to\ntake, that saying of Voltaire's, _Happiness is but a dream and sorrow\nis real_, would be as false as it is, in fact, true. A man who desires\nto make up the book of his life and determine where the balance of\nhappiness lies, must put down in his accounts, not the pleasures which\nhe has enjoyed, but the evils which he has escaped. That is the\ntrue method of eudaemonology; for all eudaemonology must begin by\nrecognizing that its very name is a euphemism, and that _to live\nhappily_ only means _to live less unhappily_--to live a tolerable\nlife. There is no doubt that life is given us, not to be enjoyed,\nbut to be overcome--to be got over. There are numerous expressions\nillustrating this--such as _degere vitam, vita defungi_; or\nin Italian, _si scampa cosi_; or in German, _man muss suchen\ndurchzukommen; er wird schon durch die Welt kommen_, and so on. In old\nage it is indeed a consolation to think that the work of life is over\nand done with. The happiest lot is not to have experienced the keenest\ndelights or the greatest pleasures, but to have brought life to a\nclose without any very great pain, bodily or mental. To measure the\nhappiness of a life by its delights or pleasures, is to apply a false\nstandard. For pleasures are and remain something negative; that\nthey produce happiness is a delusion, cherished by envy to its own\npunishment. Pain is felt to be something positive, and hence its\nabsence is the true standard of happiness. And if, over and above\nfreedom from pain, there is also an absence of boredom, the essential\nconditions of earthly happiness are attained; for all else is\nchimerical.\nIt follows from this that a man should never try to purchase pleasure\nat the cost of pain, or even at the risk of incurring it; to do so is\nto pay what is positive and real, for what is negative and illusory;\nwhile there is a net profit in sacrificing pleasure for the sake of\navoiding pain. In either case it is a matter of indifference whether\nthe pain follows the pleasure or precedes it. While it is a complete\ninversion of the natural order to try and turn this scene of misery\ninto a garden of pleasure, to aim at joy and pleasure rather than\nat the greatest possible freedom from pain--and yet how many do\nit!--there is some wisdom in taking a gloomy view, in looking upon the\nworld as a kind of Hell, and in confining one's efforts to securing\na little room that shall not be exposed to the fire. The fool rushes\nafter the pleasures of life and finds himself their dupe; the wise man\navoids its evils; and even if, notwithstanding his precautions, he\nfalls into misfortunes, that is the fault of fate, not of his own\nfolly. As far as he is successful in his endeavors, he cannot be said\nto have lived a life of illusion; for the evils which he shuns are\nvery real. Even if he goes too far out of his way to avoid evils, and\nmakes an unnecessary sacrifice of pleasure, he is, in reality, not the\nworse off for that; for all pleasures are chimerical, and to mourn\nfor having lost any of them is a frivolous, and even ridiculous\nproceeding.\nThe failure to recognize this truth--a failure promoted by optimistic\nideas--is the source of much unhappiness. In moments free from pain,\nour restless wishes present, as it were in a mirror, the image of a\nhappiness that has no counterpart in reality, seducing us to follow\nit; in doing so we bring pain upon ourselves, and that is something\nundeniably real. Afterwards, we come to look with regret upon that\nlost state of painlessness; it is a paradise which we have gambled\naway; it is no longer with us, and we long in vain to undo what has\nbeen done.\nOne might well fancy that these visions of wishes fulfilled were the\nwork of some evil spirit, conjured up in order to entice us away from\nthat painless state which forms our highest happiness.\nA careless youth may think that the world is meant to be enjoyed, as\nthough it were the abode of some real or positive happiness, which\nonly those fail to attain who are not clever enough to overcome the\ndifficulties that lie in the way. This false notion takes a stronger\nhold on him when he comes to read poetry and romance, and to be\ndeceived by outward show--the hypocrisy that characterizes the\nworld from beginning to end; on which I shall have something to say\npresently. The result is that his life is the more or less deliberate\npursuit of positive happiness; and happiness he takes to be equivalent\nto a series of definite pleasures. In seeking for these pleasures he\nencounters danger--a fact which should not be forgotten. He hunts for\ngame that does not exist; and so he ends by suffering some very\nreal and positive misfortune--pain, distress, sickness, loss, care,\npoverty, shame, and all the thousand ills of life. Too late he\ndiscovers the trick that has been played upon him.\nBut if the rule I have mentioned is observed, and a plan of life is\nadopted which proceeds by avoiding pain--in other words, by taking\nmeasures of precaution against want, sickness, and distress in all its\nforms, the aim is a real one, and something may be achieved which will\nbe great in proportion as the plan is not disturbed by striving after\nthe chimera of positive happiness. This agrees with the opinion\nexpressed by Goethe in the _Elective Affinities_, and there put into\nthe mouth of Mittler--the man who is always trying to make other\npeople happy: _To desire to get rid of an evil is a definite object,\nbut to desire a better fortune than one has is blind folly_. The same\ntruth is contained in that fine French proverb: _le mieux est l'ennemi\ndu bien_--leave well alone. And, as I have remarked in my chief\nwork,[1] this is the leading thought underlying the philosophical\nsystem of the Cynics. For what was it led the Cynics to repudiate\npleasure in every form, if it was not the fact that pain is, in a\ngreater or less degree, always bound up with pleasure? To go out of\nthe way of pain seemed to them so much easier than to secure pleasure.\nDeeply impressed as they were by the negative nature of pleasure and\nthe positive nature of pain, they consistently devoted all their\nefforts to the avoidance of pain. The first step to that end was, in\ntheir opinion, a complete and deliberate repudiation of pleasure, as\nsomething which served only to entrap the victim in order that he\nmight be delivered over to pain.\n[Footnote 1: _Welt als Wille und Vorstellung_, vol. ii., ch. 16.]\nWe are all born, as Schiller says, in Arcadia. In other words, we\ncome into the world full of claims to happiness and pleasure, and we\ncherish the fond hope of making them good. But, as a rule, Fate soon\nteaches us, in a rough and ready way that we really possess nothing at\nall, but that everything in the world is at its command, in virtue of\nan unassailable right, not only to all we have or acquire, to wife or\nchild, but even to our very limbs, our arms, legs, _eyes_ and ears,\nnay, even to the nose in the middle of our face. And in any case,\nafter some little time, we learn by experience that happiness and\npleasure are a _fata morgana_, which, visible from afar, vanish as we\napproach; that, on the other hand, suffering and pain are a reality,\nwhich makes its presence felt without any intermediary, and for its\neffect, stands in no need of illusion or the play of false hope.\nIf the teaching of experience bears fruit in us, we soon give up the\npursuit of pleasure and happiness, and think much more about making\nourselves secure against the attacks of pain and suffering. We see\nthat the best the world has to offer is an existence free from pain--a\nquiet, tolerable life; and we confine our claims to this, as to\nsomething we can more surely hope to achieve. For the safest way of\nnot being very miserable is not to expect to be very happy. Merck, the\nfriend of Goethe's youth, was conscious of this truth when he\nwrote: _It is the wretched way people have of setting up a claim to\nhappiness_--_and, that to, in a measure corresponding with their\ndesires_--_that ruins everything in this world. A man will make\nprogress if he can get rid of this claim,[1] and desire nothing but\nwhat he sees before him_. Accordingly it is advisable to put very\nmoderate limits upon our expectations of pleasure, possessions, rank,\nhonor and so on; because it is just this striving and struggling to\nbe happy, to dazzle the world, to lead a life full of pleasure, which\nentail great misfortune. It is prudent and wise, I say, to reduce\none's claims, if only for the reason that it is extremely easy to be\nvery unhappy; while to be very happy is not indeed difficult, but\nquite impossible. With justice sings the poet of life's wisdom:\n_Auream quisquis mediocritatem\nDiligit, tutus caret obsoleti\nSordibus tecti, caret invidenda\nSobrius aula.\nSavius ventis agitatur ingens\nPinus: et celsae graviori casu\nDecidunt turres; feriuntque summos\nFulgura monies.[2]_\n--the golden mean is best--to live free from the squalor of a mean\nabode, and yet not be a mark for envy. It is the tall pine which is\ncruelly shaken by the wind, the highest summits that are struck in the\nstorm, and the lofty towers that fall so heavily.\n[Footnote 1: Letters to and from Merck.]\n[Footnote 2: Horace. Odes II. x.]\nHe who has taken to heart the teaching of my philosophy--who knows,\ntherefore, that our whole existence is something which had better\nnot have been, and that to disown and disclaim it is the highest\nwisdom--he will have no great expectations from anything or any\ncondition in life: he will spend passion upon nothing in the world,\nnor lament over-much if he fails in any of his undertakings. He\nwill feel the deep truth of what Plato[1] says: [Greek: oute ti ton\nanthropinon haxion on megalaes spondaes]--nothing in human affairs is\nworth any great anxiety; or, as the Persian poet has it,\n_Though from thy grasp all worldly things should flee,\nGrieve not for them, for they are nothing worth:\nAnd though a world in thy possession be,\nJoy not, for worthless are the things of earth.\nSince to that better world 'tis given to thee\nTo pass, speed on, for this is nothing worth._[2]\n[Footnote 1: _Republic_, x. 604.]\n[Footnote 2: _Translator's Note_. From the Anv\u00e1r-i Suhail\u00ed--_The\nLights of Canopus_--being the Persian version of the _Table of\nBidpai_. Translated by E.B. Eastwick, ch. iii. Story vi., p. 289.]\nThe chief obstacle to our arriving at these salutary views is that\nhypocrisy of the world to which I have already alluded--an hypocrisy\nwhich should be early revealed to the young. Most of the glories of\nthe world are mere outward show, like the scenes on a stage: there\nis nothing real about them. Ships festooned and hung with pennants,\nfiring of cannon, illuminations, beating of drums and blowing of\ntrumpets, shouting and applauding--these are all the outward sign, the\npretence and suggestion,--as it were the hieroglyphic,--of _joy_: but\njust there, joy is, as a rule, not to be found; it is the only guest\nwho has declined to be present at the festival. Where this guest may\nreally be found, he comes generally without invitation; he is not\nformerly announced, but slips in quietly by himself _sans facon_;\noften making his appearance under the most unimportant and trivial\ncircumstances, and in the commonest company--anywhere, in short, but\nwhere the society is brilliant and distinguished. Joy is like the gold\nin the Australian mines--found only now and then, as it were, by the\ncaprice of chance, and according to no rule or law; oftenest in very\nlittle grains, and very seldom in heaps. All that outward show which I\nhave described, is only an attempt to make people believe that it\nis really joy which has come to the festival; and to produce this\nimpression upon the spectators is, in fact, the whole object of it.\nWith _mourning_ it is just the same. That long funeral procession,\nmoving up so slowly; how melancholy it looks! what an endless row of\ncarriages! But look into them--they are all empty; the coachmen of the\nwhole town are the sole escort the dead man has to his grave. Eloquent\npicture of the friendship and esteem of the world! This is the\nfalsehood, the hollowness, the hypocrisy of human affairs!\nTake another example--a roomful of guests in full dress, being\nreceived with great ceremony. You could almost believe that this is\na noble and distinguished company; but, as a matter of fact, it is\ncompulsion, pain and boredom who are the real guests. For where many\nare invited, it is a rabble--even if they all wear stars. Really good\nsociety is everywhere of necessity very small. In brilliant festivals\nand noisy entertainments, there is always, at bottom, a sense of\nemptiness prevalent. A false tone is there: such gatherings are in\nstrange contrast with the misery and barrenness of our existence. The\ncontrast brings the true condition into greater relief. Still, these\ngatherings are effective from the outside; and that is just their\npurpose. Chamfort[1] makes the excellent remark that _society_--_les\ncercles, les salons, ce qu'on appelle le monde_--is like a miserable\nplay, or a bad opera, without any interest in itself, but supported\nfor a time by mechanical aid, costumes and scenery.\n[Footnote 1: _Translator's Note_. Nicholas \"Chamfort\" (1741-94), a\nFrench miscellaneous writer, whose brilliant conversation, power of\nsarcasm, and epigrammic force, coupled with an extraordinary career,\nrender him one of the most interesting and remarkable men of his\ntime. Schopenhauer undoubtedly owed much to this writer, to whom he\nconstantly refers.]\nAnd so, too, with academies and chairs of philosophy. You have a kind\nof sign-board hung out to show the apparent abode of _wisdom_: but\nwisdom is another guest who declines the invitation; she is to be\nfound elsewhere. The chiming of bells, ecclesiastical millinery,\nattitudes of devotion, insane antics--these are the pretence, the\nfalse show of _piety_. And so on. Everything in the world is like a\nhollow nut; there is little kernel anywhere, and when it does exist,\nit is still more rare to find it in the shell. You may look for it\nelsewhere, and find it, as a rule, only by chance.\nSECTION 2. To estimate a man's condition in regard to happiness, it is\nnecessary to ask, not what things please him, but what things trouble\nhim; and the more trivial these things are in themselves, the happier\nthe man will be. To be irritated by trifles, a man must be well off;\nfor in misfortunes trifles are unfelt.\nSECTION 3. Care should be taken not to build the happiness of life\nupon a _broad foundation_--not to require a great many things in order\nto be happy. For happiness on such a foundation is the most easily\nundermined; it offers many more opportunities for accidents; and\naccidents are always happening. The architecture of happiness follows\na plan in this respect just the opposite of that adopted in every\nother case, where the broadest foundation offers the greatest\nsecurity. Accordingly, to reduce your claims to the lowest possible\ndegree, in comparison with your means,--of whatever kind these may\nbe--is the surest way of avoiding extreme misfortune.\nTo make extensive preparations for life--no matter what form they\nmay take--is one of the greatest and commonest of follies. Such\npreparations presuppose, in the first place, a long life, the full and\ncomplete term of years appointed to man--and how few reach it! and\neven if it be reached, it is still too short for all the plans that\nhave been made; for to carry them out requites more time than was\nthought necessary at the beginning. And then how many mischances and\nobstacles stand in the way! how seldom the goal is ever reached in\nhuman affairs!\nAnd lastly, even though the goal should be reached, the changes which\nTime works in us have been left out of the reckoning: we forget that\nthe capacity whether for achievement or for enjoyment does not last a\nwhole lifetime. So we often toil for things which are no longer suited\nto us when we attain them; and again, the years we spend in preparing\nfor some work, unconsciously rob us of the power for carrying it out.\nHow often it happens that a man is unable to enjoy the wealth which he\nacquired at so much trouble and risk, and that the fruits of his\nlabor are reserved for others; or that he is incapable of filling the\nposition which he has won after so many years of toil and struggle.\nFortune has come too late for him; or, contrarily, he has come too\nlate for fortune,--when, for instance, he wants to achieve great\nthings, say, in art or literature: the popular taste has changed, it\nmay be; a new generation has grown up, which takes no interest in his\nwork; others have gone a shorter way and got the start of him. These\nare the facts of life which Horace must have had in view, when he\nlamented the uselessness of all advice:--\n_quid eternis minorem\nConsiliis animum fatigas?_[1]\n[Footnote 1: Odes II. xi.]\nThe cause of this commonest of all follies is that optical illusion of\nthe mind from which everyone suffers, making life, at its beginning,\nseem of long duration; and at its end, when one looks back over the\ncourse of it, how short a time it seems! There is some advantage in\nthe illusion; but for it, no great work would ever be done.\nOur life is like a journey on which, as we advance, the landscape\ntakes a different view from that which it presented at first,\nand changes again, as we come nearer. This is just what\nhappens--especially with our wishes. We often find something else,\nnay, something better than what we are looking for; and what we look\nfor, we often find on a very different path from that on which we\nbegan a vain search. Instead of finding, as we expected, pleasure,\nhappiness, joy, we get experience, insight, knowledge--a real and\npermanent blessing, instead of a fleeting and illusory one.\nThis is the thought that runs through _Wilkelm Meister_, like the bass\nin a piece of music. In this work of Goethe's, we have a novel of the\n_intellectual_ kind, and, therefore, superior to all others, even to\nSir Walter Scott's, which are, one and all, _ethical_; in other words,\nthey treat of human nature only from the side of the will. So, too,\nin the _Zauberfl\u00f6te_--that grotesque, but still significant, and even\nhieroglyphic--the same thought is symbolized, but in great, coarse\nlines, much in the way in which scenery is painted. Here the symbol\nwould be complete if Tamino were in the end to be cured of his desire\nto possess Tainina, and received, in her stead, initiation into the\nmysteries of the Temple of Wisdom. It is quite right for Papageno, his\nnecessary contrast, to succeed in getting his Papagena.\nMen of any worth or value soon come to see that they are in the hands\nof Fate, and gratefully submit to be moulded by its teachings. They\nrecognize that the fruit of life is experience, and not happiness;\nthey become accustomed and content to exchange hope for insight; and,\nin the end, they can say, with Petrarch, that all they care for is to\nlearn:--\n_Altro diletto che 'mparar, non provo_.\nIt may even be that they to some extent still follow their old wishes\nand aims, trifling with them, as it were, for the sake of appearances;\nall the while really and seriously looking for nothing but\ninstruction; a process which lends them an air of genius, a trait of\nsomething contemplative and sublime.\nIn their search for gold, the alchemists discovered other\nthings--gunpowder, china, medicines, the laws of nature. There is a\nsense in which we are all alchemists.", "source": "counsels_and_maxims.txt"}
