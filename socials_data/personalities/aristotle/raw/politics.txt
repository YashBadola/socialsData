Man is by nature a political animal.
He who is unable to live in society, or who has no need because he is sufficient for himself, must be either a beast or a god.
The state is a creation of nature, and that man is by nature a political animal.
For as man is the best of the animals when perfected, so he is the worst of all when separated from law and justice.
A state is not a mere society, having a common place, established for the prevention of mutual crime and for the sake of exchange. These are conditions without which a state cannot exist; but all of them together do not constitute a state, which is a community of families and aggregations of families in well-being, for the sake of a perfect and self-sufficing life.
