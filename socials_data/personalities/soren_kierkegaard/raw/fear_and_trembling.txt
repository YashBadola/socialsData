Preface

Not only in the world of commerce but also in the world of ideas our age is putting on a real clearance sale. Everything can be had so dirt cheap that one begins to wonder whether in the end anyone will want to make a bid. Every speculative price-fixer who conscientiously directs attention to the significant march of modern science, every assistant professor, tutor, and student, every crofter and cottar in philosophy, is not content with doubting everything but goes further. Perhaps it would be untimely and ill-timed to ask them where they are going, but surely it is courteous and not without humble regard for established usage and sound order to assume that they have doubted everything-otherwise it would be queer to say that they were going further. This motion of going further I have tried to express in the preceding by the phrase "to go beyond faith," and I have also tried to show that this is not a step forward but a step backward.

The present writer is by no means a philosopher. He is, poetice et eleganter [in a poetic and elegant way], a freelance writer who neither writes the system nor gives promises of the system, who neither subscribes to the system nor ascribes anything to it. He writes because to him it is a luxury that becomes the more agreeable and apparent the fewer there are who buy and read what he writes. He can easily foresee his fate in an age when passion has been discarded for the sake of science, in an age when an author who wants to have readers must take care to write in such a way that the book can be easily perused during the afternoon nap, and be sure to look like the polite gardener's boy in the advertiser, who with hat in hand and good certificate from the last place he worked recommends himself to the esteemed public.

Faith is precisely this paradox, that the single individual as the particular is higher than the universal, is justified before it, not as subordinate to the universal but superior to it, yet in such a way, be it observed, that it is the single individual who, after having been subordinate as the particular to the universal, now through the universal becomes the individual who as the particular is superior to the universal, for the fact that the individual as the particular stands in an absolute relation to the absolute. This position cannot be mediated, for all mediation comes about precisely by virtue of the universal; it is and remains to all eternity a paradox, inaccessible to thought. And yet faith is this paradox-or else (these are the logical consequences which I would beg the reader to have in mind at every point, though it would be too prolix for me to reiterate them on every occasion)-or else there never has been faith...
