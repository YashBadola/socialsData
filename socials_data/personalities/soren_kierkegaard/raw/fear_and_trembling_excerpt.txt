The Knight of Faith is the only happy man, the heir to the finite, while the Knight of Resignation is a stranger and a pilgrim. But the Knight of Faith does this: he makes the infinite movement of resignation and then makes the movement of faith by virtue of the absurd. He gets the Isaac back. He lives in the finite with the full passion of the infinite. It is a paradox that the single individual is higher than the universal.
