Preface

Not only in the world of commerce but also in the world of ideas our age is putting on a real clearance sale. Everything may be had at such a bargain price that it is doubtful whether in the end there is anyone who will want to bid. Every speculative price-watcher who conscientiously signals the significant progress of modern philosophy, every lecturer at the rostrum, every student, every tutor, and every philosopher of the moment, has gone further. Going further is the password of the day; it is the "Open Sesame" of our time. But what does it mean to go further? Does it mean to go further than faith?

If faith is merely a stepping stone, then indeed, one must go further. But if faith is the paradox of life and existence, then he who goes further has likely not even arrived.

Faith is the highest passion in a human being. Many in every generation may not come that far, but none comes further. Whether there are many who do not discover it, I do not decide. I dare only appeal to myself as a witness, but no one who does not have faith can help me.

The story of Abraham is the story of faith. God tempted Abraham. He said to him, "Take now thy son, thine only son Isaac, whom thou lovest, and get thee into the land of Moriah; and offer him there for a burnt offering upon one of the mountains which I will tell thee of."

It was early in the morning, Abraham rose early, he saddled his ass, and took two of his young men with him, and Isaac his son, and clave the wood for the burnt offering, and rose up, and went unto the place of which God had told him.

And on the third day Abraham lifted up his eyes, and saw the place afar off. And Abraham said unto his young men, Abide ye here with the ass; and I and the lad will go yonder and worship, and come again to you. And Abraham took the wood of the burnt offering, and laid it upon Isaac his son; and he took the fire in his hand, and a knife; and they went both of them together.

And Isaac spake unto Abraham his father, and said, My father: and he said, Here am I, my son. And he said, Behold the fire and the wood: but where is the lamb for a burnt offering? And Abraham said, My son, God will provide himself a lamb for a burnt offering: so they went both of them together.

What did Abraham do? He arrived at the mountain. He built the altar. He bound Isaac. He took the knife.

If Abraham had hesitated, if he had doubted, if he had said, "This is impossible, God cannot want this," he would have been a tragic hero. He would have been intelligible. But Abraham believed. He believed that God would not require Isaac of him, yet he was willing to sacrifice him. He believed by virtue of the absurd.

This is the knight of faith. He resigns everything infinitely, and then he grasps everything again by virtue of the absurd. The knight of infinite resignation is understandable; the knight of faith is a paradox.
