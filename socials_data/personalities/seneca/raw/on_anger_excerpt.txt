OF ANGER

BOOK I

We must prevent anger from coming to the fore; for if it once begins to lead the charge, it is hard to retreat. Reason is strong only so long as it stands aloof from the passions; if it once mixes with them, it is defiled and can no longer hold back what it has once allowed to move forward. The mind, if it has once cast itself into anger, love, or the other passions, has no power to check its own impetus; its own weight and the downward tendency of its vice must needs carry it on and drive it to the bottom.

The best plan is to reject the first incentives to anger, to resist its very beginnings, and to take care not to be betrayed into it: for if once it begins to carry us away, it is hard to get back again into a healthy condition, because reason goes for nothing when once the passion has been admitted to the mind, and has by our own free will been given a certain authority; it will for the future do as much as it chooses, not only as much as you will allow it. The enemy, I say, must be met on the frontier: when he has once entered the city and passed its gates, he will not allow his prisoners to set bounds to his victory.

"But," says our adversary, "anger has its uses, because it makes men more ready to fight." According to that theory, drunkenness also is a good thing, for it makes men insolent and daring, and many have been better at the sword when they were the worse for liquor. Nay, according to that theory, you may call frenzy and madness essential to strength, because madness often makes men stronger. But tell me, does not fear often make the opposite result? does not the fear of death often make men fight most desperately? But what a difference there is between the courage which is inspired by drunkenness, by anger, or by fear, and that which is guided by reason! The former are like heavy rains or floods, which soon pass away; the latter is like a river, which flows on with a constant stream.

"Anger is natural," you say. "Mankind is born for mutual assistance, anger for mutual destruction: the one desires union, the other separation: the one desires to do good, the other to do harm: the one to help even strangers, the other to attack even its dearest friends: the one is ready even to sacrifice itself for the good of others, the other to plunge into danger provided it can drag its adversary with it."

How, then, can anger be in accordance with nature, when it is the vice of a creature whose nature it is to be kind?
