{"text": "Biography of Simone de Beauvoir:\n\nEarly Life: Simone de Beauvoir was born on January 9, 1908, in Paris, into a bourgeois family. She was intellectually precocious and rejected her Catholic upbringing in her teens, declaring herself an atheist. She studied philosophy at the Sorbonne and the \u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure, where she met Jean-Paul Sartre, forming a lifelong intellectual and romantic partnership.\n\nCareer: She taught at the lyc\u00e9e level until 1943. She became a prominent figure in French intellectual life, co-founding the journal 'Les Temps Modernes' with Sartre and Maurice Merleau-Ponty. She wrote novels, essays, and memoirs. Her most famous work, 'The Second Sex' (1949), is a foundational text of modern feminism.\n\nLater Years: In her later years, she became active in the women's liberation movement, notably signing the Manifesto of the 343 in 1971 advocating for abortion rights. She also wrote about aging in 'The Coming of Age'. She died on April 14, 1986, and is buried next to Sartre in Montparnasse Cemetery.", "source": "Wikipedia (structured)", "category": "biography"}
