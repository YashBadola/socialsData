One is not born, but rather becomes, a woman. No biological, psychological, or economic fate determines the figure that the human female presents in society; it is civilization as a whole that produces this creature, intermediate between male and eunuch, which is described as feminine. Only the intervention of someone else can establish an individual as an Other. The child would generally understand the law of the father and the mother as such, but the spontaneous reactions of his own body and the relationship with the mother would remain a mystery to him.

If the little girl were brought up from the beginning with the same demands and honors, the same severity and freedom as her brothers, she would participate in the same future and would not feel the weight of the "eternal feminine" upon her. But in fact, the circle is vicious; the more women are respected, the more they are "feminine," that is, they are more easily resigned to their lot.

To be a woman is to have become one; it is to have been made into one. This is the core of my argument. We must understand that the situation of woman is not a result of her nature, but of her history.
