One does not offer an ethics to a god. It is impossible to propose any to man if one defines him as nature, as something given. The so-called psychological or empirical ethics manage to establish themselves only by introducing surreptitiously some flaw within the man-thing which they have first defined. Hegel tells us that the willed is the subjective, the contingent, the particular, which implies that it remains essential that it be willed, that is to say, that one should be able to not will it. And for Spinoza, the doctrine of the beatitude or the salvation of the soul would be unintelligible if the latter were a substance, if it were not a "part of the infinite intellect of God," that is, if it were not a lack.

Man is a being of the distances, a movement toward the future, a project. He defines himself by his ends. But if he is nothing but a desire for being, he is condemned to failure. For the being that he makes himself is distinct from the being that he is. He is not the being that he makes himself; he makes himself a being that he is not. Thus, the passion of man is the reverse of that of Christ, for man loses himself as man in order that God may be born. But the idea of God is contradictory and we lose ourselves in vain; man is a useless passion.

This pessimistic conclusion of L'Etre et le Neant does not prevent Sartre from proposing an ethics. On the contrary, it is the condition of it. Existentialism is defined as a philosophy of ambiguity. It was by affirming the irreducible character of ambiguity that Kierkegaard opposed himself to Hegel, and it is by ambiguity that, in our own generation, Sartre, in Being and Nothingness, fundamentally challenged the antithesis of being and nothingness.

The notion of ambiguity must not be confused with that of absurdity. To declare that existence is absurd is to deny that it can ever be given a meaning; to say that it is ambiguous is to assert that its meaning is never fixed, that it must be constantly won. Absurdity challenges every ethics; but also the finished rationalization of the real would leave no room for ethics; it is because man's condition is ambiguous that he seeks, through failure and outrageousness, to save his existence. Thus, to say that it is ambiguous is to assert that its meaning is never fixed, that it must be constantly won.

The continuous work of our life, says Montaigne, is to build death. . . . It is a condition of our life that we must die. . . . We are all destined to die, and it is this certitude which gives our life its tragic character. But if we must die, we must also live. And it is this living which is the true subject of ethics. The problem of ethics is not how to die, but how to live. And to live is to act. To act is to choose. To choose is to be free.

Freedom is the source from which all significations and all values spring. It is the original condition of all justification of existence. The man who seeks to justify his life must want freedom itself absolutely and above everything else. At the same time that it requires the realization of concrete ends, of particular projects, it requires itself universally. It is not a ready-made value which offers itself from the outside to my abstract will, but it is the very stuff of my being; and as such, it must be won. To will oneself free is also to will others free. This is not an abstract formula. It points out to each individual his concrete action.
