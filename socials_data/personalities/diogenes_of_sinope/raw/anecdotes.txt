When Alexander the Great visited Diogenes, he asked if there was anything he could do for the philosopher. Diogenes replied, "Yes, stand a little out of my sun." Alexander was so impressed by this indifference to his power that he said, "If I were not Alexander, I would wish to be Diogenes."

Plato defined a human being as a "featherless biped." Diogenes plucked a chicken and brought it into Plato's Academy, crying, "Behold! I've brought you a man." Plato subsequently added "with broad flat nails" to his definition.

Diogenes was known for walking around Athens in broad daylight carrying a lit lamp. When asked what he was doing, he replied, "I am looking for a human being" (implying he could find no one worthy of the name).

Seeing a child drink water from his hands at a fountain, Diogenes took the wooden cup from his wallet and threw it away, saying, "A child has beaten me in plainness of living."

When asked why he was begging from a statue, he replied, "To get practice in being refused."

Once, upon seeing the son of a prostitute throwing stones at a crowd, Diogenes approached him and whispered, "Take care, boy, that you do not hit your father."

When asked what was the right time to marry, Diogenes replied, "For a young man, not yet; for an old man, never at all."

He was once observed eating in the marketplace (which was considered vulgar). When people gathered around calling him a dog, he replied, "It is you who are dogs, who stand around and watch me eat."

Someone asked him what he had gained from philosophy. "If nothing else," he replied, "at least I am prepared for every fortune."

When he was captured by pirates and put up for sale as a slave, the auctioneer asked him what he was good at. Diogenes replied, "Ruling men." He then pointed to a wealthy Corinthian named Xeniades and said, "Sell me to that man; he needs a master."
