The world is all that is the case.
The world is the totality of facts, not of things.
The limits of my language mean the limits of my world.
Whereof one cannot speak, thereof one must be silent.
Logic fills the world: the limits of the world are also its limits.
Death is not an event in life: we do not live to experience death.
If we take eternity to mean not infinite temporal duration but timelessness, then eternal life belongs to those who live in the present.
Ethics and aesthetics are one.
Language disguises thought.
The solution of the riddle of life in space and time lies outside space and time.
Belief in the causal nexus is superstition.
Most of the propositions and questions to be found in philosophical works are not false but nonsensical.
The object of philosophy is the logical clarification of thoughts.
Philosophy is not a theory but an activity.
In the world everything is as it is and happens as it does happen. In it, there is no value, - and if there were, it would be of no value.
There can never be surprises in logic.
It is not how things are in the world that is mystical, but that it exists.
Roughly speaking: to say of two things that they are identical is nonsense, and to say of one thing that it is identical with itself is to say nothing.
There are, indeed, things that cannot be put into words. They make themselves manifest. They are what is mystical.
