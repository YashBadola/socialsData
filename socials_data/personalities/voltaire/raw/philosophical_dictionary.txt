TOLERANCE.

What is tolerance? It is the appurtenance of humanity. We are all full of weakness and errors; let us mutually pardon each other our follies - it is the first law of nature.

When, on the exchange of Amsterdam, of London, or of Surat, or of Bassora, the Guebre, the Banian, the Jew, the Mahometan, the Chinese Deist, the Brahmin, the Christian of the Greek Church, the Roman Catholic Christian, the Protestant Christian, and the Quaker Christian, traffic together, they do not lift the poignard against each other in order to gain souls for their religion. Why then have we been cutting one another's throats almost without interruption since the first Council of Nice?

The Constantinopolitans, who thought themselves so much wiser than the rest of the world, could not find any better way of settling their differences than by massacring one another; and the Turks, who are not quite so wise, have laughed at them.

It is clear that every private individual who persecutes a man, his brother, because he is not of the same opinion, is a monster. This admits of no difficulty. But the government, the magistrates, the princes! — how do they conduct themselves towards those who have a faith different from their own? If they are powerful foreigners, it is certain that a prince will form an alliance with them. The Francis I., most Christian, will ally himself with the Mussulmans against the Charles V., most Catholic. Francis I. will give money to the Lutherans of Germany to support them in their rebellion against their emperor; but he will commence, as usual, by having the Lutherans in his own dominions burned. He pays them in Saxony from policy; he burns them at Paris from policy. But what follows? Persecutions make proselytes. France, England, and Germany were filled with horrors.

If you have two religions in your country, they will cut one another's throats; if you have thirty religions, they will dwell in peace. Look at the Great Turk. He governs Guebres, Banians, Christians of the Greek, Roman, and Protestant churches, and Jews. All these sects live in peace in his empire, and the Turks themselves are very good people.
