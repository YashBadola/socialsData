The Knight of Faith.

If I were to describe the movements of faith, I would say this: The knight of faith makes the movement of infinity, but he does it with such correctness and assurance that he gets the finite out of it. He does not lose the finite, he gains it.

The ethical expression for what Abraham did is that he would murder Isaac; the religious expression is that he would sacrifice Isaac--but in this contradiction lies the very anguish that can indeed make a sleeplessness essential to the knight of faith.

Faith is precisely this paradox, that the single individual is higher than the universal, yet in such a way, be it noted, that the movement repeats itself, and that consequently the single individual, after having been in the universal, now as the single individual isolates himself as higher than the universal. If this is not faith, then Abraham is lost, then faith has never existed in the world...

But the knight of faith knows that it is glorious to belong to the universal. He knows that it is beautiful and salutary to be the individual who translates himself into the universal, who edits, as it were, a pure and elegant edition of himself, as free from errors as possible and readable by all. But he knows also that higher than this there is a lonely path, narrow and steep; he knows that it is terrible to be born outside the universal, to walk without meeting a single traveler.
