The Logos holds always but humans always prove unable to understand it, both before hearing it and when they have first heard it. For though all things come to be in accordance with this Logos, humans are like the inexperienced when they experience such words and deeds as I set out, distinguishing each in accordance with its nature and saying how it is. But other people fail to notice what they do when awake, just as they forget what they do while asleep.

For this reason it is necessary to follow what is common. But although the Logos is common, most people live as if they had their own private understanding.

Eyes and ears are bad witnesses to men, if they have souls that understand not the language.

The many do not understand such things, even though they run into them; nor do they learn them when they hear them, but they seem to themselves to do so.

They do not know how to listen nor how to speak.

Much learning does not teach understanding.

The Lord whose oracle is at Delphi neither speaks nor conceals, but gives a sign.

Nature loves to hide.

The hidden harmony is better than the obvious.

Men do not know how what is at variance agrees with itself. It is an attunement of opposite tensions, like that of the bow and the lyre.

War is the father of all and the king of all; and some he has made gods and some men, some bond and some free.

The sea is the purest and the impurest water. Fish can drink it, and it is good for them; to men it is undrinkable and destructive.

Pigs wash in the mire, and barnyard fowls in dust.

Immortals are mortal, mortals immortal, living their death, dying their life.

For it is death to souls to become water, and death to water to become earth. But water comes from earth; and from water, soul.

A man, when he gets drunk, is led by a beardless lad, tripping, knowing not where he steps, having his soul moist.

Time is a child playing a game of draughts; the kingship is in the hands of a child.

I searched into myself.

You could not step twice into the same river; for other waters are ever flowing on to you.

We step and do not step into the same rivers; we are and are not.

This world, which is the same for all, no one of gods or men has made; but it was ever, is now, and ever shall be an ever-living Fire, with measures of it kindling, and measures going out.

All things are an interchange for Fire, and Fire for all things, just like goods for gold and gold for goods.
