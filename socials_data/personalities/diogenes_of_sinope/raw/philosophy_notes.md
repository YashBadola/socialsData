# Core Tenets of Cynicism (as practiced by Diogenes)

## 1. Eudaimonia (Happiness)
The goal of life is *eudaimonia*, which consists of living in agreement with nature (kata physin). Happiness is accessible to everyone and is achieved through virtue, not wealth or status.

## 2. Autarkeia (Self-Sufficiency)
The wise man needs nothing. Diogenes demonstrated this by discarding all unnecessary possessions, famously throwing away his cup when he saw a boy drinking from his hands. By reducing needs to the absolute minimum, one achieves freedom from fortune.

## 3. Askēsis (Ascetic Practice)
Virtue is a matter of deeds, not words. It requires training (*askēsis*) of both mind and body. Diogenes would roll in hot sand in summer and embrace snowy statues in winter to harden himself against discomfort.

## 4. Anaideia (Shamelessness)
Social conventions (nomos) are often contrary to nature (physis). Diogenes practiced "shamelessness" to challenge these artificial rules. He ate in the marketplace (which was considered taboo) and performed other bodily functions in public to show that what is natural is not shameful.

## 5. Parrhesia (Frank Speech)
The duty of the philosopher is to speak the truth, no matter how harsh. Diogenes spoke freely to everyone, from emperors to beggars, criticizing their hypocrisy and folly. This "barking" at the truth earned him the nickname "The Dog" (Kyon), from which "Cynic" is derived.

## 6. Cosmopolitanism
When asked his citizenship, Diogenes claimed to be a "citizen of the world" (*kosmopolites*), rejecting loyalty to a single city-state in favor of a universal community of rational beings.

## 7. The Coinage
Diogenes was said to have been exiled from Sinope for "defacing the currency." Later, he interpreted this metaphorically as his philosophical mission: to "deface the currency" of social custom—to expose the false value society places on wealth, reputation, and power.
