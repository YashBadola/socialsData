{"text": "Greetings from Seneca to his friend Lucilius.\nJudging by what you write me, and by what I hear, I am forming a good opinion regarding your future. You do not run hither and thither and distract yourself by changing your abode; for such restlessness is the sign of a disordered spirit. The primary indication, to my thinking, of a well-ordered mind is a man's ability to remain in one place and linger in his own company. Be careful, however, lest this reading of many authors and this sitting at every famous writer's door may tend to make you discursive and unsteady. You must linger among a limited number of master-thinkers, and digest their works, if you would derive ideas which shall win a firm hold in your mind. Everywhere means nowhere. When a person spends all his time in foreign travel, he ends by having many acquaintances, but no friends. And the same thing must hold true of men who seek intimate acquaintance with no single author, but visit them all in a hasty and hurried manner.\nFood does no good and is not assimilated into the body if it leaves the stomach as soon as it is eaten; nothing hinders a cure so much as frequent change of medicine; no wound will heal when one tries the experiment of different oils upon it; a plant which is often moved can never grow strong. There is nothing so efficacious that it can be helpful while it is being shifted about. And in reading of many books is distraction.\nAccordingly, since you cannot read all the books which you may possess, it is enough to possess only as many books as you can read. \"But,\" you reply, \"I wish to dip first into one book and then into another.\" I tell you that it is the sign of an over-nice appetite to toy with many dishes; for when they are manifold and varied, they cloy but do not nourish. So you should always read standard authors; and when you crave a change, fall back upon those whom you read before. Each day acquire something that will fortify you against poverty, against death, indeed against other misfortunes as well; and after you have run over many thoughts, select one to be thoroughly digested that day.\nThis is my own custom; from the many things which I have read, I claim some one part for myself. The thought for today is one which I discovered in Epicurus; for I am wont to cross over even into the enemy's camp, \u2013 not as a deserter, but as a scout. He says: \"Contented poverty is an honourable estate.\" Indeed, if it be contented, it is not poverty at all. It is not the man who has too little, but the man who craves more, that is poor. What does it matter how much a man has laid up in his safe, or in his warehouse, how large are his flocks and how fat his dividends, if he covets his neighbour's property, and reckons, not his past gains, but his hopes of gains to come? Do you ask what is the proper limit to wealth? It is, first, to have what is necessary, and, second, to have what is enough.\nFarewell.", "source": "letter_2.txt"}
{"text": "We must not be angry with the gods, for these are the source of our benefits, not of our misfortunes; nor with men, for they are our fellow-creatures. In fact, if we are angry with the good, we are wrong; if with the bad, we are wasting our time. For who is angry with a child because it is not yet able to walk? Who is angry with a sick man because he has a fever? It is the part of a madman to be angry with things which have no life, and which can neither hurt nor help us.\nAnger is a temporary madness. For look at the tokens of those who are possessed by anger: their eyes blaze and sparkle, their whole face is crimson with the blood that surges up from the depths of the heart, their lips quiver, their teeth grind, their hair bristles and stands on end, their breathing is forced and rapid, their joints crack from writhing, they groan and bellow, and burst out into speech with scarcely intelligible words, they strike their hands together and stamp the ground with their feet, and their whole body is agitated and performs the threat of anger. It is an ugly and horrible picture of distorted and swollen frenzy\u2014you cannot tell whether this vice is more execrable or more hideous.\nThe best plan is to reject straightway the first incentives to anger, to resist its very beginnings, and to take care not to be betrayed into it: for if once it begins to carry us away, it is hard to get back again into a healthy condition, because reason goes for nothing when once the passions have been admitted to the mind, and have by our own free will been given a certain authority; they will for the future do as much as they choose, not only as much as you will allow them. The enemy must be met at the very frontier: when he has once entered the city and passed its gates, he will not allow his prisoners to set bounds to his victory.", "source": "on_anger.txt"}
{"text": "Greetings from Seneca to his friend Lucilius.\nContinue to act thus, my dear Lucilius - set yourself free for your own sake; gather and save your time, which has been forced from you, or stolen away, or has merely slipped from your hands. Make yourself believe the truth of my words, - that certain moments are torn from us, that some are gently removed, and that others glide beyond our reach. The most disgraceful kind of loss, however, is that due to carelessness. Furthermore, if you will pay close heed, you will see that the largest portion of our life passes while we are doing ill, a goodly share while we are doing nothing, and the whole while we are doing that which is not to the purpose.\nWhat man can you show me who places any value on his time, who reckons the worth of each day, who understands that he is dying daily? For we are mistaken when we look forward to death; the major portion of death has already passed. Whatever years be behind us are in death's hands.\nTherefore, Lucilius, do as you write me that you are doing: hold every hour in your grasp. Lay hold of to-day's task, and you will not need to depend so much upon to-morrow's. While we are postponing, life speeds by. Nothing, Lucilius, is ours, except time. We were entrusted by nature with the ownership of this single thing, so fleeting and slippery that anyone who will can oust us from possession. What fools these mortals be! They allow the cheapest and most useless things, which can easily be replaced, to be charged in the reckoning, after they have acquired them; but they never regard themselves as in debt when they have received some of that precious commodity, \u2014 time! And yet time is the only loan which even a grateful recipient can never repay.\nYou may desire to know how I, who preach this doctrine, practice it. I confess that I do so as a lavish but careful man. I keep an account of my outlays. I cannot say that I lose nothing, but I can say what I lose, and why, and how; I can give the reasons for my poverty. But it happens to me as it happens to many others who are reduced to slender means through no fault of their own: everyone forgives them, but no one comes to their rescue.\nWhat is the state of things, then? It is this: I do not regard a man as poor, if the little which remains is enough for him. I advise you, however, to keep what is really yours; and you cannot begin too early. For, as our ancestors believed, it is too late to spare when you reach the dregs of the cask. Of that which remains at the bottom, the amount is slight, and the quality is vile.\nFarewell.", "source": "letter_1.txt"}
{"text": "It is not that we have a short time to live, but that we waste a lot of it. Life is long enough, and a sufficiently generous amount has been given to us for the highest achievements if it were all well invested. But when it is wasted in heedless luxury and spent on no good activity, we are forced at last by death's final constraint to realize that it has passed away before we knew it was passing. So it is: we are not given a short life but we make it short, and we are not ill-supplied but wasteful of it. Just as when ample and princely wealth falls to a bad owner it is squandered in a moment, but wealth however modest, if entrusted to a good custodian, increases with use, so our lifetime extends for plenty of time if you manage it properly.\nWhy do we complain of Nature? She has shown herself kindly; life, if you know how to use it, is long. But one man is gripped by insatiable avarice, another by a laborious diligence in useless tasks. One man is soaked in wine, another sluggish with idleness. One man is worn out by political ambition, which is always at the mercy of the judgment of others. Another through hope of profit is driven to trade, leading him to travel over all lands and seas. Some are tormented by a servile duty to their superiors, giving their own lives to enrich others. Many are pursued by the beauty of others or their own. And many have no fixed purpose, but are tossed about by ever-changing, fickle, and dissatisfied plans.\nThere is no reason why you should think that a man has lived long because he has grey hair and wrinkles: he has not lived long, he has only existed long. For what if you should think that that man had had a long voyage who had been caught by a fierce storm as soon as he left harbor, and, swept hither and thither by a succession of winds that raged from different quarters, had been driven in a circle around the same course? He has not had much voyage, but much tossing about.", "source": "on_shortness_of_life.txt"}
