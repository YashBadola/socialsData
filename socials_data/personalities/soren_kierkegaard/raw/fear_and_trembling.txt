    PREPARATION

   There lived a man who, when a child, had heard the beautiful Bible
   story of how God tempted Abraham and how he stood the test, how he
   maintained his faith and, against his expectations, received his son
   back again. As this man grew older he read this same story with ever
   greater admiration; for now life had separated what had been united in
   the reverent simplicity of the child. And the older he grew, the more
   frequently his thoughts reverted to that story. His enthusiasm waxed
   stronger and stronger, and yet the story grew less and less clear to
   him. Finally he forgot everything else in thinking about it, and his
   soul contained but one wish, which was, to behold Abraham: and but one
   longing, which was, to have been witness to that event. His desire was,
   not to see the beautiful lands of the Orient, and not the splendor of
   the Promised Land, and not the reverent couple whose old age the Lord
   had blessed with children, and not the venerable figure of the aged
   patriarch, and not the god-given vigorous youth of Isaac—it would have
   been the same to him if the event had come to pass on some barren
   heath. But his wish was, to have been with Abraham on the three days'
   journey, when he rode with sorrow before him and with Isaac at his
   side. His wish was, to have been present at the moment when Abraham
   lifted up his eyes and saw Mount Moriah afar off; to have been present
   at the moment when he left his asses behind and wended his way up to
   the mountain alone with Isaac. For the mind of this man was busy, not
   with the delicate conceits of the imagination, but rather with his
   shuddering thought.

   The man we speak of was no thinker, he felt no desire to go beyond his
   faith: it seemed to him the most glorious fate to be remembered as the
   Father of Faith, and a most enviable lot to be possessed of that faith,
   even if no one knew it.

   The man we speak of was no learned exegetist, he did not even
   understand Hebrew—who knows but a knowledge of Hebrew might have helped
   him to understand readily both the story and Abraham.

    I

   And God tempted Abraham and said unto him: take Isaac, thine only son,
   whom thou lovest and go to the land Moriah and sacrifice him there on a
   mountain which I shall show thee.

   It was in the early morning, Abraham arose betimes and had his asses
   saddled. He departed from his tent, and Isaac with him; but Sarah
   looked out of the window after them until they were out of sight.
   Silently they rode for three days; but on the fourth morning Abraham
   said not a word but lifted up his eyes and beheld Mount Moriah in the
   distance. He left his servants behind and, leading Isaac by the hand,
   he approached the mountain. But Abraham said to himself: "I shall
   surely conceal from Isaac whither he is going." He stood still, he laid
   his hand on Isaac's head to bless him, and Isaac bowed down to receive
   his blessing. And Abraham's aspect was fatherly, his glance was mild,
   his speech admonishing. But Isaac understood him not, his soul would
   not rise to him; he embraced Abraham's knees, he besought him at his
   feet, he begged for his young life, for his beautiful hopes, he
   recalled the joy in Abraham's house when he was born, he reminded him
   of the sorrow and the loneliness that would be after him. Then did
   Abraham raise up the youth and lead him by his hand, and his words were
   full of consolation and admonishment. But Isaac understood him not. He
   ascended Mount Moriah, but Isaac understood him not. Then Abraham
   averted his face for a moment; but when Isaac looked again, his
   father's countenance was changed, his glance wild, his aspect terrible,
   he seized Isaac and threw him to the ground and said: "Thou foolish
   lad, believest thou I am thy father? An idol-worshipper am I. Believest
   thou it is God's command? Nay, but my pleasure." Then Isaac trembled
   and cried out in his fear: "God in heaven, have pity on me, God of
   Abraham, show mercy to me, I have no father on earth, be thou then my
   father!" But Abraham said softly to himself: "Father in heaven, I thank
   thee. Better is it that he believes me inhuman than that he should lose
   his faith in thee."

   When the child is to be weaned, his mother blackens her breast; for it
   were a pity if her breast should look sweet to him when he is not to
   have it. Then the child believes that her breast has changed; but his
   mother is ever the same, her glance is full of love and as tender as
   ever. Happy he who needed not worse means to wean his child!

    A PANEGYRIC ON ABRAHAM

   If a consciousness of the eternal were not implanted in man; if the
   basis of all that exists were but a confusedly fermenting element
   which, convulsed by obscure passions, produced all, both the great and
   the insignificant; if under everything there lay a bottomless void
   never to be filled—what else were life but despair? If it were thus,
   and if there were no sacred bonds between man and man; if one
   generation arose after another, as in the forest the leaves of one
   season succeed the leaves of another, or like the songs of birds which
   are taken up one after another; if the generations of man passed
   through the world like a ship passing through the sea and the wind over
   the desert—a fruitless and a vain thing; if eternal oblivion were ever
   greedily watching for its prey and there existed no power strong enough
   to wrest it from its clutches—how empty were life then, and how dismal!
   And yet it is not thus; but, just as God created man and woman, he
   likewise called into being the hero and the poet or orator. The latter
   cannot perform the deeds of the hero—he can only admire and love him
   and rejoice in him. And yet he also is happy and not less so; for the
   hero is, as it were, his better self with which he has fallen in love,
   and he is glad he is not himself the hero, so that his love can express
   itself in admiration.

   The poet is the genius of memory, and does nothing but recall what has
   been done, can do nothing but admire what has been done. He adds
   nothing of his own, but he is jealous of what has been entrusted to
   him. He obeys the choice of his own heart; but once he has found what
   he has been seeking, he visits every man's door with his song and with
   his speech, so that all may admire the hero as he does, and be proud of
   the hero as he is. This is his achievement, his humble work, this is
   his faithful service in the house of the hero. If thus, faithful to his
   love, he battles day and night against the guile of oblivion which
   wishes to lure the hero from him, then has he accomplished his task,
   then is he gathered to his hero who loves him as faithfully; for the
   poet is at it were the hero's better self, unsubstantial, to be sure,
   like a mere memory, but also transfigured as is a memory. Therefore
   shall no one be forgotten who has done great deeds; and even if there
   be delay, even if the cloud of misunderstanding obscure the hero from
   our vision, still his lover will come some time; and the more time has
   passed, the more faithfully will he cleave to him.

   No, no one shall be forgotten who was great in this world. But each
   hero was great in his own way, and each one was eminent in proportion
   to the great things he loved. For he who loved himself became great
   through himself, and he who loved others became great through his
   devotion, but he who loved God became greater than all of these.
   Everyone of them shall be remembered, but each one became great in
   proportion to his trust. One became great by hoping for the possible;
   another, by hoping for the eternal; but he who hoped for the
   impossible, he became greater than all of these. Every one shall be
   remembered; but each one was great in proportion to the power with
   which he strove. For he who strove with the world became great by
   overcoming himself; but he who strove with God, he became the greatest
   of them all. Thus there have been struggles in the world, man against
   man, one against a thousand; but he who struggled with God, he became
   greatest of them all. Thus there was fighting on this earth, and there
   was he who conquered everything by his strength, and there was he who
   conquered God by his weakness. There was he who, trusting in himself,
   gained all; and there was he who, trusting in his strength sacrificed
   everything; but he who believed in God was greater than all of these.
   There was he who was great through his strength, and he who was great
   through his wisdom, and he who was great through his hopes, and he who
   was great through his love; but Abraham was greater than all of
   these—great through the strength whose power is weakness, great through
   the wisdom whose secret is folly, great through the hope whose
   expression is madness, great through the love which is hatred of one's
   self.
