{"text": "The gods had condemned Sisyphus to ceaselessly rolling a rock to the top of a mountain, whence the stone would fall back of its own weight. They had thought with some reason that there is no more dreadful punishment than futile and hopeless labor.\nIf one admits that the significant does not appear, one must admit that the insignificant is the only meaning.\nThere is but one truly serious philosophical problem, and that is suicide. Judging whether life is or is not worth living amounts to answering the fundamental question of philosophy. All the rest\u2014whether or not the world has three dimensions, whether the mind has nine or twelve categories\u2014comes afterwards. These are games; one must first answer.\nI see many people die because they judge that life is not worth living. I see others paradoxically getting killed for the ideas or illusions that give them a reason for living (what is called a reason for living is also an excellent reason for dying). I therefore conclude that the meaning of life is the most urgent of questions.\nThe absurd is born of this confrontation between the human need and the unreasonable silence of the world.\nI leave Sisyphus at the foot of the mountain! One always finds one's burden again. But Sisyphus teaches the higher fidelity that negates the gods and raises rocks. He too concludes that all is well. This universe henceforth without a master seems to him neither sterile nor futile. Each atom of that stone, each mineral flake of that night-filled mountain, in itself forms a world. The struggle itself toward the heights is enough to fill a man's heart. One must imagine Sisyphus happy.\nIn the midst of winter, I found there was, within me, an invincible summer.\nDon't walk in front of me\u2026 I may not follow\nDon't walk behind me\u2026 I may not lead\nWalk beside me\u2026 just be my friend\nMan is the only creature who refuses to be what he is.\nReal generosity toward the future lies in giving all to the present.\nThe only way to deal with an unfree world is to become so absolutely free that your very existence is an act of rebellion.", "source": "sisyphus_snippets.txt"}
