Preface

Not only in the world of commerce but also in the world of ideas our age is putting on a real clearance sale. Everything can be had so dirt cheap that one begins to wonder whether in the end anyone will want to make a bid. Every speculative price-fixer who conscientiously directs attention to the significant march of modern philosophy, every privat-docent, tutor, and student, every crofter and cottager in philosophy, is not content with doubting everything but goes further. Perhaps it would be untimely and ill-timed to ask them where they are going, but surely it is courteous and unobtrusive to take it for granted that they have doubted everything, since otherwise it would be a curious statement for them to make, that they were proceeding further. This proceeding further, this movement, may essentially be the same as that which I, a poor writer of prefaces, am wont to make when I say: "Whatever is to come of this, I do not know; but this much is certain, that I will not check my pen until I have said everything."

The Knight of Faith

The knight of faith is the only happy man, the heir to the finite, while the knight of resignation is a stranger and an alien. To get the princess, to live with her joyfully and happily day in and day out (for it is also conceivable that the knight of resignation might get the princess, but that his soul would be too gloomy to enjoy the happiness)—that is what means to live every moment to see the sword hanging over the loved one’s head, and yet to find repose in the pain of resignation, but to find joy by virtue of the absurd.

Faith is precisely this paradox, that the single individual is higher than the universal, yet in such a way, be it observed, that the movement repeats itself, and that consequently the individual, after having been in the universal, now as the single individual isolates himself as higher than the universal. If this be not faith, then Abraham is lost, then faith has never existed in the world... because it has always existed.
