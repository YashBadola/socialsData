{"text": "What I really need is to get clear about what I must do, not what I must know, except insofar as knowledge must precede every act. What matters is to find a purpose, to see what it really is that God wills that I shall do; the crucial thing is to find a truth which is truth for me, to find the idea for which I am willing to live and die.\nMarry, and you will regret it; don\u2019t marry, you will also regret it; marry or don\u2019t marry, you will regret it either way. Laugh at the world\u2019s foolishness, you will regret it; weep over it, you will regret that too; laugh at the world\u2019s foolishness or weep over it, you will regret both. Believe a woman, you will regret it; believe her not, you will also regret it\u2026 Hang yourself, you will regret it; do not hang yourself, and you will regret that too; hang yourself or don\u2019t hang yourself, you\u2019ll regret it either way; whether you hang yourself or do not hang yourself, you will regret both. This, gentlemen, is the essence of all philosophy.\nThe most common form of despair is not being who you are.\nLife can only be understood backwards; but it must be lived forwards.\nAnxiety is the dizziness of freedom.\nPeople demand freedom of speech as a compensation for the freedom of thought which they seldom use.\nThere are two ways to be fooled. One is to believe what isn't true; the other is to refuse to believe what is true.\nThe function of prayer is not to influence God, but rather to change the nature of the one who prays.\nTo cheat oneself out of love is the most terrible deception; it is an eternal loss for which there is no reparation, either in time or in eternity.\nSubjectivity is truth.\nThe highest and most beautiful things in life are not to be heard about, nor read about, nor seen; but, if one will, are to be lived.", "source": "quotes.txt"}
{"text": "Preface to Either/Or\nIt may at times have occurred to you, dear reader, to doubt somewhat the correctness of the familiar philosophical proposition that the outer is the inner\u2014the inner, the outer. You have perhaps never felt a temptation more appealing than when you surprised the outer in the very act of giving the lie to the inner, or the inner to the outer. For my own part, I am of a somewhat heretical turn of mind on this point. It has always been a matter of great interest to me to observe the various ways in which the inner and the outer are related. A very simple observation has often put me in the way of discovering the most interesting phenomena. I have noticed that there are men whose inner life is so strong that it completely dominates the outer, so that the latter becomes a mere transparency through which the inner shines with undimmed brightness. Again, I have observed men whose inner life is so weak that it is completely lost in the outer, so that the latter becomes a mere mask, behind which the inner is concealed. Finally, I have observed men whose inner life and outer life are in a state of constant conflict, so that the one is constantly giving the lie to the other.\nA Fragment of Life\nI have just come from a party of which I was the soul; witticism flowed from my mouth, everyone laughed and admired me\u2014but I went away\u2014and the dash should be as long as the earth's orbit\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014and wanted to shoot myself.\nThe aesthetic choice is either entirely immediate, or it loses itself in the multifarious. Thus, when a young girl follows the choice of her heart, this choice, however beautiful it may be, is in the strictest sense no choice, since it is entirely immediate. When a man deliberates aesthetically upon a multitude of life's problems, as did the Greek, for example, the aesthetic in his soul will not easily be able to crystallize itself in a choice, just because the aesthetic is the multifarious. The ethical choice is therefore in a stricter sense a choice, because it is a choice of the self.\nThe Unhappiest One\nSomewhere in England there is a grave that is not like other graves. It is not a green mound, it is not a monument of stone. It is a simple slab of white marble, level with the ground. Every year it sinks a little deeper into the earth, and it is said that when it has sunk so deep that the inscription is no longer visible, the world will come to an end. The inscription reads: THE UNHAPPIEST ONE.", "source": "either_or_excerpts.txt"}
