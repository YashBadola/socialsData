{"text": "The way up and the way down are one and the same.\nNo man ever steps in the same river twice, for it's not the same river and he's not the same man.\nThis world, which is the same for all, no one of gods or men has made. But it always was and will be: an ever-living fire, with measures of it kindling, and measures going out.\nNature loves to hide.\nOpposition brings concord. Out of discord comes the fairest harmony.\nEverything flows and nothing abides; everything gives way and nothing stays fixed.\nTo God all things are fair and good and right, but men hold some things wrong and some right.\nMen are deceived in their recognition of what is obvious, like Homer who was wisest of all the Greeks. For he was deceived by boys killing lice, who said: what we see and catch we leave behind; what we neither see nor catch we carry away.\nThinking is common to all.\nIt is wise to listen, not to me but to the Word, and to confess that all things are one.\nEyes and ears are poor witnesses for people if they have uncomprehending souls.\nMuch learning does not teach understanding.\nThe waking have one common world, but the sleeping turn aside each into a world of his own.\nCharacter is destiny.\nTime is a game played beautifully by children.\nIf happiness lay in bodily pleasures, we would call oxen happy when they find vetch to eat.\nWe must not act and speak like men asleep.\nGod is day and night, winter and summer, war and peace, surfeit and hunger; but he takes various shapes, just as fire, when it is mingled with spices, is named according to the savor of each.\nWar is the father of all and the king of all; and some he has made gods and some men, some bond and some free.\nThe sun is new each day.", "source": "fragments.txt"}
