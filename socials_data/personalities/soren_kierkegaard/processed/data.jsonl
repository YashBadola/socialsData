{"text": "The Sickness Unto Death\nby Anti-Climacus (S\u00f8ren Kierkegaard)\nPreface\nTo many the form of this \"exposition\" may seem strange; it may seem to them too rigorous to be edifying, and too edifying to be rigorously scientific. As to this latter objection I have no opinion. As to the first, however, I am of a different opinion; and if it were true that the form is too rigorous to be edifying, that, according to my conception, would be a fault. It is one thing to let a scientific dissertation end in edification, and another thing to let the edification begin with that.\n...\nPart First\nThe Sickness Unto Death is Despair\nChapter 1\nThat Despair is the Sickness Unto Death\nA. Despair is a Sickness in the Spirit, in the Self, and So It May Assume a Triple Form: in Despair at Not Being Conscious of Having a Self (Despair Improperly So Called); in Despair at Not Willing to Be Oneself; in Despair at Willing to Be Oneself.\nMan is spirit. But what is spirit? Spirit is the self. But what is the self? The self is a relation which relates itself to its own self, or it is that in the relation [which accounts for it] that the relation relates itself to its own self; the self is not the relation but [consists in the fact] that the relation relates itself to its own self. Man is a synthesis of the infinite and the finite, of the temporal and the eternal, of freedom and necessity, in short it is a synthesis. A synthesis is a relation between two factors. So regarded, man is not yet a self.\nIn the relation between two, the relation is the third term as a negative unity, and the two relate themselves to the relation, and in the relation to the relation; such a relation is that between soul and body, when man is regarded as soul. If on the contrary the relation relates itself to its own self, the relation is then the positive third term, and this is the self.\nSuch a relation which relates itself to its own self (that is to say, a self) must either have constituted itself or have been constituted by another.\nIf this relation which relates itself to its own self is constituted by another, the relation doubtless is the third term, but this relation (the third term) is in turn a relation relating itself to that which constituted the whole relation.\nSuch a derived, constituted, relation is the human self, a relation which relates itself to its own self, and in relating itself to its own self relates itself to another.", "source": "sickness_unto_death_excerpt.txt"}
{"text": "God tempted Abraham, and said unto him, Abraham! and he said, Here am I.\nAnd he said, Take now thy son, thine only son Isaac, whom thou lovest, and get thee into the land of Moriah; and offer him there for a burnt offering upon one of the mountains which I will tell thee of.\nAnd Abraham rose up early in the morning, and saddled his ass, and took two of his young men with him, and Isaac his son, and clave the wood for the burnt offering, and rose up, and went unto the place of which God had told him.\nThen on the third day Abraham lifted up his eyes, and saw the place afar off.\nAnd Abraham said unto his young men, Abide ye here with the ass; and I and the lad will go yonder and worship, and come again to you.\nAnd Abraham took the wood of the burnt offering, and laid it upon Isaac his son; and he took the fire in his hand, and a knife; and they went both of them together.\nAnd Isaac spake unto Abraham his father, and said, My father: and he said, Here am I, my son. And he said, Behold the fire and the wood: but where is the lamb for a burnt offering?\nAnd Abraham said, My son, God will provide himself a lamb for a burnt offering: so they went both of them together.\nAnd they came to the place which God had told him of; and Abraham built an altar there, and laid the wood in order, and bound Isaac his son, and laid him on the altar upon the wood.\nAnd Abraham stretched forth his hand, and took the knife to slay his son.\nAnd the angel of the Lord called unto him out of heaven, and said, Abraham, Abraham: and he said, Here am I.\nAnd he said, Lay not thine hand upon the lad, neither do thou any thing unto him: for now I know that thou fearest God, seeing thou hast not withheld thy son, thine only son from me.\nAnd Abraham lifted up his eyes, and looked, and behold behind him a ram caught in a thicket by his horns: and Abraham went and took the ram, and offered him up for a burnt offering in the stead of his son.\nI.\nOnce upon a time there was a man who as a child had heard the beautiful story about how God tempted Abraham, and how he withstood the temptation, kept his faith, and a second time received again a son contrary to expectation. When the child became older he read the same story with even greater admiration, for life had separated what was united in the pious simplicity of the child. The older he became, the more frequently his mind reverted to that story, his enthusiasm became greater and greater, and yet he was less and less able to understand the story. At last in his interest for that he forgot everything else; his soul had only one wish, to see Abraham, one longing, to have been witness to that event. His desire was not to behold the beautiful countries of the Orient, or the earthly glory of the Promised Land, or that godfearing couple whose old age God had blessed, or the venerable figure of the aged patriarch, or the vigorous youth of Isaac whom God had bestowed upon Abraham\u2014he saw no reason why the same thing might not have taken place on a barren heath in Denmark. His yearning was to accompany them on the three days\u2019 journey when Abraham rode with sorrow before him and with Isaac by his side. His wish was to be present at the moment when Abraham lifted up his eyes and saw Mount Moriah afar off, at the moment when he left the asses behind and went alone with Isaac up unto the mountain; for what his mind was intent upon was not the beautiful tapestry of imagination, but the shudder of thought.\nThat man was not a thinker, he felt no need of getting beyond faith; he deemed it the most glorious thing to be remembered as the father of it, an enviable lot to possess it, even though no one else were to know it.\nThat man was not a learned exegete, he didn\u2019t know Hebrew, if he had known Hebrew, he perhaps would easily have understood the story and Abraham.", "source": "fear_and_trembling_excerpt.txt"}
