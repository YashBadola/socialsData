{"text": "The Sickness Unto Death is Despair.\nA. Despair is a Sickness in the Spirit, in the Self, and So It May Have a Threefold Form: in Despair at Not Being Conscious of Having a Self (Despair Improperly So Called); in Despair at Not Willing to Be Oneself; in Despair at Willing to Be Oneself.\nMan is spirit. But what is spirit? Spirit is the self. But what is the self? The self is a relation which relates itself to its own self, or it is that in the relation [which accounts for it] that the relation relates itself to its own self; the self is not the relation but [consists in the fact] that the relation relates itself to its own self. Man is a synthesis of the infinite and the finite, of the temporal and the eternal, of freedom and necessity, in short it is a synthesis. A synthesis is a relation between two factors. So regarded, man is not yet a self.\nIn the relation between two, the relation is the third term as a negative unity, and the two relate themselves to the relation, and in the relation to the relation; such a relation is that between soul and body, when man is regarded as soul. But if the relation relates itself to its own self, the relation is then the positive third term, and this is the self.", "source": "sickness_unto_death_excerpt.txt"}
{"text": "Preface\nNot only in the world of commerce but also in the world of ideas our age is putting on a real clearance sale. Everything can be had so dirt cheap that one begins to wonder whether in the end anyone will want to make a bid. Every speculative price-setter who conscientiously signals the significant trends of the modern era, every assistant professor, tutor, and student, every crofter and cottar in philosophy, is not content with stopping at doubting everything but goes right on.\nThe Teleological Suspension of the Ethical\nFaith is precisely this paradox, that the single individual is higher than the universal, yet in such a way, be it noted, that the movement repeats itself, and that consequently the single individual, after having been in the universal, now as the single individual isolates himself as higher than the universal. If this be not faith, then Abraham is lost, then faith has never existed in the world...\nThe Knight of Faith\nIf I were to describe the movements of faith, I would say: infinite resignation is the last stage before faith, so that anyone who has not made this movement does not have faith; for only in the infinite resignation do I become clear to myself in my eternal validity, and only then can there be any question of grasping existence by virtue of faith.", "source": "fear_and_trembling_excerpt.txt"}
