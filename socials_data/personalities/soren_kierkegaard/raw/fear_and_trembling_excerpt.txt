Preface
Not only in the world of commerce but also in the world of ideas our age is putting on a real clearance sale. Everything can be had at such a bargain that it is doubtful whether in the end there is anyone who will want to bid. Every speculative price-fixer who conscientiously directs attention to the significant march of modern philosophy, every privatdocent, tutor, and student, every crofter and cottager in philosophy, is not stopping at doubting everything but is going further. Perhaps it would be untimely and ill-timed to ask them where they are going, but surely it is courteous and not without humble interest to assume that they have doubted everything, since otherwise it would be queer for them to be going further. This motion of going further I have followed and have also made, although due to my own inertia I have not been able to make it into a formula, effectively and comfortably, but have made it clumsily and with great difficulty in my own body.

Problem I: Is there a Teleological Suspension of the Ethical?
The ethical as such is the universal, and as the universal it applies to everyone, which may be expressed from another point of view by saying that it applies every instant. It rests immanent in itself, has nothing without itself which is its telos, but is itself telos for everything outside it, and when this has been incorporated by the ethical it can go no further. Conceived immediately as physical and psychical, the particular individual is the individual who has his telos in the universal, and his ethical task is to express himself constantly in it, to abolish his particularity in order to become the universal. As soon as the individual would assert himself as the particular over against the universal, he sins, and only by recognizing this can he again reconcile himself with the universal.

Faith is precisely this paradox, that the individual as the particular is higher than the universal, is justified over against it, is not subordinate but superior—yet in such a way, be it observed, that it is the particular individual who, after he has been subordinated as the particular to the universal, now through the universal becomes the individual who as the particular is superior to the universal, for the fact that the individual as the particular stands in an absolute relation to the absolute. This position cannot be mediated, for all mediation comes about precisely by virtue of the universal; it is and remains to all eternity a paradox, inaccessible to thought. And yet faith is this paradox—or else (these are the logical deductions which I would beg the reader to have in mind at every point, though it would be too prolix for me to reiterate them on every occasion)—or else there never has been faith... or else Abraham is lost.

The Knight of Faith
He who loves God without faith reflects on himself, he who loves God believingly reflects on God. Upon this pinnacle stands Abraham. The last stage he loses sight of is the infinite resignation. He really goes further and comes to faith. For all these caricatures of faith, the miserable lukewarm sloth which thinks: "There is surely no instant need, it is not worth while sorrowing before the time"; the pitiful hope which says: "One cannot know what is going to happen... it might possibly be after all"—these caricatures belong to the life of finiteness, the infinite resignation has already scorned them.
Infinite resignation is the last stage prior to faith, so that one who has not made this movement has not faith; for only in the infinite resignation do I become clear to myself with respect to my eternal validity, and only then can there be any question of grasping existence by virtue of faith.
