The Situation

The tragic ambivalence which we have just pointed out in the present situation of the woman is that she feels herself to be an autonomous individual, and yet she is defined and treated as the Other. She is not a subject, she is an object. She is not a self, she is an other. This is the fundamental contradiction which she must resolve. But she cannot resolve it by herself, because the situation is not of her own making. It is the result of a long history, of a whole civilization.

It is not a question of asserting that women are simply victims of men. That would be too simple. Women have often been complicit in their own oppression. They have accepted the role of the Other because it offers certain advantages. It is easier to be an object than a subject. It is easier to be a child than an adult. It is easier to be a dependent than an independent being.

But this ease is a trap. It is a temptation to avoid the responsibility of freedom. And freedom is the only thing that gives meaning to human existence. Without freedom, life is nothing but a meaningless repetition of biological functions.

To become a woman, in the full sense of the word, is to conquer this temptation, to reject the role of the Other, to assert oneself as a Subject. It is to accept the risk of freedom, the anxiety of choice, the burden of responsibility. It is to create oneself, to define oneself, to become what one is.

One is not born, but rather becomes, a woman. No biological, psychological, or economic fate determines the figure that the human female presents in society; it is civilization as a whole that produces this creature, intermediate between male and eunuch, which is described as feminine. Only the intervention of someone else can establish an individual as an Other. The child would appreciate the world about her as a blessed harvest-time, she would discover herself as a free subject, if she were not molded by her teachers into the passive object she is doomed to become.
