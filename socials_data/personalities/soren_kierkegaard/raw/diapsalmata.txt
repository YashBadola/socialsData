What is a poet? An unhappy man who in his heart harbors a deep anguish, but whose lips are so fashioned that the moans and cries which pass over them are transformed into ravishing music. His fate is like that of the unfortunate victims whom the tyrant Phalaris imprisoned in a brazen bull, and slowly tortured over a steady fire; their cries could not reach the tyrant’s ears so as to strike terror into his heart; when they reached his ears they sounded like sweet music.

And men crowd about the poet and say to him, “Sing for us soon again”—which is as much as to say, “May new sufferings torment your soul, but may your lips be fashioned as before; for the cries would only distress us, but the music is delicious.” And the critics come forward and say, “That is perfectly done—just as it should be, according to the rules of aesthetics.” Now it is understood that a critic resembles a poet to a hair; he only lacks the anguish in his heart and the music upon his lips. lo, I tell you, I would rather be a swineherd, understood by the swine, than a poet misunderstood by men.

I don’t care for anything. I don’t care to ride, for the exercise is too violent. I don’t care to walk, walking is too strenuous. I don’t care to lie down, for I should either have to remain lying, and I don’t care to do that, or I should have to get up again, and I don’t care to do that either. Summa summarum: I don’t care at all.
