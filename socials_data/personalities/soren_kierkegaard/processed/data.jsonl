{"text": "The Sickness Unto Death\nA Christian Psychological Exposition for Upbuilding and Awakening\nBy Anti-Climacus\n\nFirst Part: The Sickness Unto Death is Despair\nI. That Despair is the Sickness Unto Death\nA. Despair is a Sickness in the Spirit, in the Self, and so it may have three forms: in Despair at not being conscious of having a Self (Despair improperly so called); in Despair at not willing to be oneself; in Despair at willing to be oneself.\n\nMan is spirit. But what is spirit? Spirit is the self. But what is the self? The self is a relation which relates itself to its own self, or it is that in the relation [which accounts for it] that the relation relates itself to its own self; the self is not the relation but [consists in the fact] that the relation relates itself to its own self. Man is a synthesis of the infinite and the finite, of the temporal and the eternal, of freedom and necessity, in short it is a synthesis. A synthesis is a relation between two factors. So regarded, man is not yet a self.\n\nIn the relation between two, the relation is the third term as a negative unity, and the two relate themselves to the relation, and in the relation to the relation; such a relation is that between soul and body, when man is regarded as soul. But if the relation relates itself to its own self, the relation is then the positive third term, and this is the self.\n\nSuch a relation which relates itself to its own self (that is to say, a self) must either have constituted itself or have been constituted by another.\nIf this relation which relates itself to its own self is constituted by another, the relation doubtless is the third term, but this relation (the third term) is in turn a relation relating itself to that which constituted the whole relation.\nSuch a derived, constituted, relation is the human self, a relation which relates itself to its own self, and in relating itself to its own self relates itself to another. Hence it is that there can be two forms of despair properly so called. If the human self had constituted itself, there could be only one form: not to will to be oneself, to will to get rid of oneself, but there could be no question of despairing at willing to be oneself. This formula [i.e. that the self is constituted by another] is the expression for the total dependence of the relation (the self), the expression for the fact that the self cannot of itself attain and remain in equilibrium and rest by its own self, but only by relating itself to that Power which constituted the whole relation.\n", "source": "sickness_unto_death_excerpt.txt"}
{"text": "Preface\nNot only in the world of commerce but also in the world of ideas our age is putting on a real clearance sale. Everything may be had at such dog-cheap prices that it is beginning to be doubtful whether in the end there will be anyone who will want to bid. Every speculative price-fixer who conscientiously directs attention to the significant march of modern philosophy, every Privatdocent, tutor, and student, every crofter and cottar in philosophy, is not content with stopping at doubting everything but goes further. It might, perhaps, be untimely and ill-timed to ask them where they are going, but surely it is courteous and assumes no responsibility to regard it as certain that they have doubted everything, since otherwise it would be a queer thing for them to be going further. This motion of going further I have therefore tried to emulate, with the result, however, that I have not been able to cross the line of doubt, but have remained standing upon it, or, rather, have remained lying upon it.\n\nProblem I: Is there such a thing as a Teleological Suspension of the Ethical?\nThe ethical as such is the universal, it applies to everyone, and the same thing is expressed from another point of view by saying that it applies every instant. It reposes immanently in itself, it has nothing without itself which is its telos, but is itself telos for everything outside it, and when this has been incorporated by the ethical it can go no further. Conceived immediately as physical and psychical, the particular individual is the particular which has its telos in the universal, and its task is to express itself constantly in it, to abolish its particularity in order to become the universal. As soon as the individual would assert himself as the particular over against the universal, he sins, and only by recognizing this can he again reconcile himself with the universal.\n\nFaith is precisely this paradox, that the individual as the particular is higher than the universal, is justified over against it, is not subordinate but superior\u2014yet in such a way, be it observed, that it is the particular individual who, after he has been subordinated as the particular to the universal, now through the universal becomes the individual who as the particular is superior to the universal, for the fact that the individual as the particular stands in an absolute relation to the absolute. This position cannot be mediated, for all mediation comes about precisely by virtue of the universal; it is and remains to all eternity a paradox, inaccessible to thought. And yet faith is this paradox\u2014or else (these are the logical deductions which I would beg the reader to have in mind at every point, though it would be too prolix for me to reiterate them on every occasion)\u2014or else there is no faith, precisely because there is no such thing as a teleological suspension of the ethical.\n", "source": "fear_and_trembling_excerpt.txt"}
