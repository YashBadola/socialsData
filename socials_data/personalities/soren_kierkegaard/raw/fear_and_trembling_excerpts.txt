Preface

Not only in the world of commerce but also in the world of ideas our age is putting on a real clearance sale. Everything may be had at such a dirt-cheap price that one begins to wonder whether in the end anyone will want to make a bid.

The Knight of Faith

If I were to speak of the knight of faith, I should say: He is the only happy man, the heir to the finite. And yet, the crowd does not see him. He looks just like a tax collector. He tends to his work, he takes a walk on Sundays, he enjoys the dinner his wife has prepared. There is nothing about him that betrays the infinite movement he has made.

Faith is precisely this paradox, that the single individual is higher than the universal. It is a paradox that cannot be mediated. The ethical is the universal, and as such it applies to everyone. But the knight of faith steps out of the universal and into the absolute relationship with the Absolute. This is the teleological suspension of the ethical.

Abraham did not explain himself to Sarah or to Eliezer. He could not. For what he was about to do was, ethically speaking, murder. But religiously speaking, it was a sacrifice. The distress and the anguish of this paradox is what the knight of faith endures. He has given up everything infinite, and then he grasps the finite by virtue of the absurd.

Infinite resignation is the last stage before faith, so that anyone who has not made this movement does not have faith. For only in the infinite resignation do I become clear to myself with respect to my eternal validity, and only then can one speak of grasping existence by virtue of faith.
