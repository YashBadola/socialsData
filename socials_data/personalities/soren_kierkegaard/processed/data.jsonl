{"text": "The Sickness Unto Death\nA Christian Psychological Exposition for Upbuilding and Awakening\nPart First\nThe Sickness Unto Death is Despair\nI. That Despair is the Sickness Unto Death\nA. Despair is a Sickness in the Spirit, in the Self, and so it may assume a triple form: in Despair at not being conscious of having a self (Despair improperly so called); in Despair at not willing to be oneself; in Despair at willing to be oneself.\nMan is spirit. But what is spirit? Spirit is the self. But what is the self? The self is a relation which relates itself to its own self, or it is that in the relation [which accounts for it] that the relation relates itself to its own self; the self is not the relation but [consists in the fact] that the relation relates itself to its own self. Man is a synthesis of the infinite and the finite, of the temporal and the eternal, of freedom and necessity, in short it is a synthesis. A synthesis is a relation between two factors. So regarded, man is not yet a self.\nIn the relation between two, the relation is the third term as a negative unity, and the two relate themselves to the relation, and in the relation to the relation; such a relation is that between soul and body, when man is regarded as soul. If on the contrary the relation relates itself to its own self, the relation is then the positive third term, and this is the self.\nSuch a relation which relates itself to its own self (that is to say, a self) must either have constituted itself or have been constituted by another.\nIf this relation which relates itself to its own self is constituted by another, the relation doubtless is the third term, but this relation (the third term) is in turn a relation relating itself to that which constituted the whole relation.\nSuch a derived, constituted, relation is the human self, a relation which relates itself to its own self, and in relating itself to its own self relates itself to another. Hence it is that there can be two forms of despair properly so called. If the human self had constituted itself, there could be a question only of one form: not willing to be one's own self, of willing to get rid of oneself, but there could be no question of despair at willing to be oneself.\nThis form of despair (willing to be oneself) is the formula for all despair, so that the first form (not willing to be oneself) resolves itself into the second (willing to be oneself), just as in the foregoing we saw that the one form (despair at not willing to be oneself) resolves itself into the other (despair at willing to be oneself).\nThe formula that describes the state of the self when despair is completely rooted out is this: in relating itself to itself and in willing to be itself, the self rests transparently in the power that established it.\nB. Possibility and Necessity\nThe self is the synthesis of possibility and necessity. The self is composed of finitude and infinitude. But this synthesis is not the self, it is the task.\nIf the self gets lost in possibility, it has no necessity to which it must return. It runs wild in possibility. But possibility is like a child who must be given something; necessity is like a grave man who takes something.\nIf the self gets lost in necessity, it has no possibility. The philistine is the man without possibility. He is the man who lives in the trivial. He lacks the imagination to see the possibility.\nFaith is the specific remedy for this sickness. For with God all things are possible. The believer possesses the eternally certain antidote to despair: possibility.", "source": "sickness_unto_death_excerpt.txt"}
{"text": "Diapsalmata\nI have just now come from a party where I was its life and soul; witticisms streamed from my lips, everyone laughed and admired me, but I went away \u2014 yes, the dash should be as long as the radius of the earth's orbit \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 and wanted to shoot myself.\nWhat is a poet? An unhappy man who in his heart harbors a deep anguish, but whose lips are so fashioned that the sighs and cries which pass over them are transformed into ravishing music. His fate is like that of the unfortunate victims whom the tyrant Phalaris imprisoned in a brazen bull, and slowly tortured over a steady fire; their cries could not reach the tyrant\u2019s ears so as to strike terror into his heart; when they reached him they sounded like sweet music. And men crowd about the poet and say to him: \u201cSing for us soon again\u201d \u2014 that is as much as to say: \u201cMay new sufferings torment your soul, but may your lips be fashioned as before; for the cries would only distress us, but the music is delicious.\u201d\nMy life is like an eternal night. What if I were to die? And yet, what if I were to live? There is no meaning in it. My life has no significance. My standpoint is armed neutrality.\nBoredom is the root of all evil. It is very curious that boredom, which itself has such a calm and sedate nature, can have such a capacity to initiate motion. The effect of boredom is usually strongest when it ceases to be abstract and becomes concrete.\nThe Rotation of Crops\nPeople with experience maintain that proceeding from a basic principle is the supposed method of all science. Suppose, then, that we establish the principle that all men are bores. Or is there anyone who would be so boring as to contradict me in this? This principle possesses the quality of being in the highest degree repellent, an essential requirement in the negative.\nThe method I propose does not consist in changing the soil but, like proper crop rotation, consists in changing the method of cultivation and the kinds of crops. Here we have at once the principle of limitation, the only saving principle in the world. The more you limit yourself, the more fertile you become in invention. A prisoner in solitary confinement for life becomes very inventive, and a spider may furnish him with much entertainment.\nTo be a Teacher\nIf real success is to attend the effort to bring a man to a definite position, one must first of all take pains to find him where he is and begin there. This is the secret of the art of helping others. Anyone who has not mastered this is himself deluded when he proposes to help others. In order to help another effectively I must understand more than he\u2014yet first of all surely I must understand what he understands. If I do not know that, my greater understanding will be of no help to him. If, however, I am disposed to plume myself on my greater understanding, it is because I am vain or proud, so that at bottom, instead of benefiting him, I want to be admired.\nBut all true helping begins with a humbling. The helper must first humble himself under him he would help, and therewith understand that to help does not mean to be a sovereign but to be a servant, that to help does not mean to be ambitious but to be patient, that to help means to endure for the time being the imputation that one is in the wrong and does not understand what the other understands.", "source": "either_or_excerpt.txt"}
{"text": "Preface\nNot only in the world of commerce but also in the world of ideas our age is putting on a real clearance sale. Everything can be had at such a bargain that it is doubtful whether in the end there is anyone who will want to bid. Every speculative price-fixer who conscientiously directs attention to the significant march of modern philosophy, every privatdocent, tutor, and student, every crofter and cottager in philosophy, is not stopping at doubting everything but is going further. Perhaps it would be untimely and ill-timed to ask them where they are going, but surely it is courteous and not without humble interest to assume that they have doubted everything, since otherwise it would be queer for them to be going further. This motion of going further I have followed and have also made, although due to my own inertia I have not been able to make it into a formula, effectively and comfortably, but have made it clumsily and with great difficulty in my own body.\nProblem I: Is there a Teleological Suspension of the Ethical?\nThe ethical as such is the universal, and as the universal it applies to everyone, which may be expressed from another point of view by saying that it applies every instant. It rests immanent in itself, has nothing without itself which is its telos, but is itself telos for everything outside it, and when this has been incorporated by the ethical it can go no further. Conceived immediately as physical and psychical, the particular individual is the individual who has his telos in the universal, and his ethical task is to express himself constantly in it, to abolish his particularity in order to become the universal. As soon as the individual would assert himself as the particular over against the universal, he sins, and only by recognizing this can he again reconcile himself with the universal.\nFaith is precisely this paradox, that the individual as the particular is higher than the universal, is justified over against it, is not subordinate but superior\u2014yet in such a way, be it observed, that it is the particular individual who, after he has been subordinated as the particular to the universal, now through the universal becomes the individual who as the particular is superior to the universal, for the fact that the individual as the particular stands in an absolute relation to the absolute. This position cannot be mediated, for all mediation comes about precisely by virtue of the universal; it is and remains to all eternity a paradox, inaccessible to thought. And yet faith is this paradox\u2014or else (these are the logical deductions which I would beg the reader to have in mind at every point, though it would be too prolix for me to reiterate them on every occasion)\u2014or else there never has been faith... or else Abraham is lost.\nThe Knight of Faith\nHe who loves God without faith reflects on himself, he who loves God believingly reflects on God. Upon this pinnacle stands Abraham. The last stage he loses sight of is the infinite resignation. He really goes further and comes to faith. For all these caricatures of faith, the miserable lukewarm sloth which thinks: \"There is surely no instant need, it is not worth while sorrowing before the time\"; the pitiful hope which says: \"One cannot know what is going to happen... it might possibly be after all\"\u2014these caricatures belong to the life of finiteness, the infinite resignation has already scorned them.\nInfinite resignation is the last stage prior to faith, so that one who has not made this movement has not faith; for only in the infinite resignation do I become clear to myself with respect to my eternal validity, and only then can there be any question of grasping existence by virtue of faith.", "source": "fear_and_trembling_excerpt.txt"}
