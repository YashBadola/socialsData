{"text": "PROPOSITIONS.\nPROP. I. Substance is by nature prior to its modifications.\nProof.\u2014This is evident from Def. iii. and v.\nPROP. II. Two substances, having different attributes, have nothing in common.\nProof.\u2014Also evident from Def. iii. For each must exist in itself, and be conceived through itself; in other words, the conception of one does not imply the conception of the other.\nPROP. III. Things which have nothing in common cannot be one the cause of the other.\nProof.\u2014If they have nothing in common, it follows that one cannot be apprehended by means of the other (Ax. v.), and, therefore, one cannot be the cause of the other (Ax. iv.). Q.E.D.\nPROP. XI. God, or substance, consisting of infinite attributes, of which each expresses eternal and infinite essentiality, necessarily exists.\nProof.\u2014If this be denied, conceive, if possible, that God does not exist: then his essence does not involve existence. But this (by Prop. vii.) is absurd. Therefore God necessarily exists.\nPROP. XIV. Besides God no substance can be granted or conceived.\nProof.\u2014As God is a being absolutely infinite, of whom no attribute that expresses the essence of substance can be denied (by Def. vi.), and he necessarily exists (by Prop. xi.); if any substance besides God were granted, it would have to be explained by some attribute of God, and thus two substances with the same attribute would exist, which (by Prop. v.) is absurd; therefore, besides God no substance can be granted, or, consequently, conceived. If it could be conceived, it would necessarily have to be conceived as existent; but this (by the first part of this proof) is absurd. Therefore, besides God no substance can be granted or conceived. Q.E.D.\nCorollary I.\u2014Clearly, therefore: 1. That God is one, that is (by Def. vi.) only one substance can be granted in the universe, and that substance is absolutely infinite, as we have already indicated (in the note to Prop. x.).", "source": "ethics_part1_propositions.txt"}

{"text": "ETHICS\nPART I. CONCERNING GOD.\nDEFINITIONS.\nI. By that which is self-caused, I mean that of which the essence involves existence, or that of which the nature is only conceivable as existent.\nII. A thing is called finite after its kind, when it can be limited by another thing of the same nature; for instance, a body is called finite because we always conceive another greater body. So, also, a thought is limited by another thought, but a body is not limited by thought, nor a thought by body.\nIII. By substance, I mean that which is in itself, and is conceived through itself: in other words, that of which a conception can be formed independently of any other conception.\nIV. By attribute, I mean that which the intellect perceives as constituting the essence of substance.\nV. By mode, I mean the modifications of substance, or that which exists in, and is conceived through, something other than itself.\nVI. By God, I mean a being absolutely infinite\u2014that is, a substance consisting in infinite attributes, of which each expresses eternal and infinite essentiality.\nExplanation.\u2014I say absolutely infinite, not infinite after its kind: for, of a thing infinite only after its kind, infinite attributes may be denied; but that which is absolutely infinite, contains in its essence whatever expresses reality, and involves no negation.\nVII. That thing is called free, which exists solely by the necessity of its own nature, and of which the action is determined by itself alone. On the other hand, that thing is necessary, or rather constrained, which is determined by something external to itself to a fixed and definite method of existence or action.\nVIII. By eternity, I mean existence itself, in so far as it is conceived necessarily to follow solely from the definition of that which is eternal.\nExplanation.\u2014For such existence is conceived as an eternal truth, like the essence of the thing, and therefore cannot be explained by duration or time, even if the duration be conceived without beginning or end.", "source": "ethics_part1_definitions.txt"}
{"text": "PART II. OF THE NATURE AND ORIGIN OF THE MIND.\nPROP. I. Thought is an attribute of God, or God is a thinking thing.\nProof.\u2014Particular thoughts, or this or that thought, are modes which, in a certain conditioned manner, express the nature of God (Part I., Prop. xxv., Coroll.). God therefore possesses the attribute (Part I., Def. v.) of which the concept is involved in all particular thoughts, which latter are conceived thereby. Thought, therefore, is one of the infinite attributes of God, which express God's eternal and infinite essence (Part I., Def. vi.), or God is a thinking thing. Q.E.D.\nPROP. II. Extension is an attribute of God, or God is an extended thing.\nProof.\u2014The proof of this proposition is similar to that of the last.\nPROP. VII. The order and connection of ideas is the same as the order and connection of things.\nProof.\u2014This is evident from Part I., Ax. iv. For the idea of everything that is caused depends on a knowledge of the cause, whereof it is an effect.\nCorollary.\u2014Hence God's power of thinking is equal to his actual power of acting; that is, whatever follows from the infinite nature of God in the world of extension (formaliter), follows without exception in the same order and connection from the idea of God in the world of thought (objective).", "source": "ethics_part2_excerpt.txt"}
