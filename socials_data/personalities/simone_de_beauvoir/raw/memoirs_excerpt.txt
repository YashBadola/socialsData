I was born at four o'clock in the morning on the 9th of January 1908, in a room fitted with white-enamelled furniture and overlooking the Boulevard Raspail. In the family photographs taken the following summer, one can see ladies in long dresses and feathered hats, and gentlemen in boaters and panama hats, smiling at a baby: they are my parents, my grandfather, uncles, aunts; and the baby is me. My father was thirty, my mother twenty-one, and I was their first child. I turn the page: here is a photograph of Mama holding in her arms a baby who isn't me; I am wearing a pleated skirt and a beret; I am two and a half, and my sister has just been born. I was, it appears, jealous, but not for long. As far back as I can remember, I was proud of being the elder: the first. Disguised as Little Red Riding Hood, carrying a basket of cakes and a pot of butter, I felt myself to be much more interesting than an infant swaddled in her cradle. I had a little sister: that baby doll was me.

I remember the apartment in the Boulevard Raspail: the dining-room with its Henri II sideboard and its Cordoba leather chairs, the drawing-room with its Louis XV furniture, the study where my father worked. I remember my room, with its white-enamelled furniture, the bed with the brass knobs, the chest of drawers. I remember the smells: the smell of floor-polish, of cooking, of my mother's perfume. I remember the sounds: the piano, the voices, the street noises. I remember the people: my parents, my sister, the servants, the visitors. I remember the games, the walks, the lessons. I remember my childhood as a happy time, a time of innocence and security. But I also remember the shadows, the fears, the doubts. I remember the feeling of being different, of being apart. I remember the desire to know, to understand, to be free.

My father was a man of culture and intelligence, but he was also a man of his time and his class. He believed in the values of the bourgeoisie, in religion, in patriotism. He wanted me to be a well-brought-up young lady, destined for a good marriage. My mother was a devout Catholic, a woman of duty and sacrifice. She wanted me to be a good Christian, a dutiful daughter. I loved them both, but I felt stifled by their expectations. I wanted something else, something more. I wanted to be a writer, an intellectual, a free woman. I wanted to live my own life, to make my own choices, to create my own meaning.
