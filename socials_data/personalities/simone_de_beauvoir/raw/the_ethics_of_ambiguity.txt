The Aesthetic Attitude

   Thus, every man has to do with other men. The world in which he engages
   himself is a human world in which each object is penetrated with human
   meanings. It is a speaking world from which solicitations and appeals
   rise up. This means that, through this world, each individual can give
   his freedom a concrete content. He must disclose the world with the
   purpose of further disclosure and by the same movement try to free men,
   by means of whom the world takes on meaning. But we shall find here the
   same objection that we met when we examined the abstract moment of
   individual ethics. If every man is free, he can not will himself free.
   Likewise the objection will be raised that he can will nothing for
   another since that other is free in all circumstances; men are always
   disclosing being, in Buchenwald as well as in the blue isles of the
   Pacific, in hovels as well as in palaces; something is always happening
   in the world, and in the movement of keeping being at a distance, can
   one not consider its different transformations with a detached joy, or
   find reasons for acting? No solution is better or worse than any other.

   We may call this attitude aesthetic because the one who adopts it
   claims to have no other relation with the world than that of detached
   contemplation; outside of time, and far from men, he faces history,
   which he thinks he does not belong to, like a pure beholding; this
   impersonal version equalizes all situations; it apprehends them only in
   the indifference of their differences; it excludes any preference.

   Thus, the lover of historical works is present at the birth and the
   downfall of Athens, Rome, and Byzantium with the same serene passion.
   The tourist considers the arena of the Coliseum, the Latifundia of
   Syracuse, the thermal baths, the palaces, the temples, the prisons, and
   the churches with the same tranquil curiosity: these things existed,
   that is enough to satisfy him. Why not also consider with impartial
   interest those that exist today? One finds this temptation among many
   Italians who are weighed down by a magical and deceptive past; the
   present already seems to them like a future past. Wars, civil disputes,
   invasions and slavery have succeeded one another in their land. Each
   moment of that tormented history is contradicted by the following one;
   and yet in the very midst of this vain agitation there arose domes,
   statues, bas-reliefs, paintings and palaces which have remained intact
   through the centuries and which still enchant the men of today. One can
   imagine an intellectual Florentine being skeptical about the great
   uncertain movements which are stirring up his country and which will
   die out as did the seethings of the centuries which have gone by: as he
   sees it, the important thing is merely to understand the temporary
   events and through them to cultivate that beauty which perishes not.
   Many Frenchmen also sought relief in this thought in 1940 and the years
   which followed. “Let’s try to take the point of view of history,” they
   said upon learning that the Germans had entered Paris. And during the
   whole occupation certain intellectuals sought to keep “aloof from the
   fray” and to consider impartially contingent facts which did not
   concern them.

   But we note at once that such an attitude appears in moments of
   discouragement and confusion; in fact, it is a position of withdrawal,
   a way of fleeing the truth of the present. As concerns the past, this
   eclecticism is legitimate; we are no longer in a live situation in
   regard to Athens, Sparta, or Alexandria, and the very idea of a choice
   has no meaning. But the present is not a potential past; it is the
   moment of choice and action; we can not avoid living it through a
   project; and there is no project which is purely contemplative since
   one always projects himself toward something, toward the future; to put
   oneself “outside” is still a way of living the inescapable fact that
   one is inside; those French intellectuals who, in the name of history,
   poetry, or art, sought to rise above the drama of the age, were
   willy-nilly its actors more or less explicitly, they were playing the
   occupier’s game. Likewise, the Italian aesthete, occupied in caressing
   the marbles and bronzes of Florence, is playing a political role in the
   life of his country by his very inertia. One can not justify all that
   is by asserting that everything may equally be the object of
   contemplation, since man never contemplates: he does.

   It is for the artist and the writer that the problem is raised in a
   particularly acute and at the same time equivocal manner, for then one
   seeks to set up the indifference of human situations not in the name of
   pure contemplation, but of a definite project: the creator projects
   toward the work of art a subject which he justifies insofar as it is
   the matter of this work; any subject may thus be admitted, a massacre
   as well as a masquerade. This aesthetic justification is sometimes so
   striking that it betrays the author’s aim; let us say that a writer
   wants to communicate the horror inspired in him by children working in
   sweatshops; he produces so beautiful a book that, enchanted by the
   tale, the style, and the images, we forget the horror of the sweatshops
   or even start admiring it. Will we not then be inclined to think that
   if death, misery, and injustice can be transfigured for our delight, it
   is not an evil for there to be death, misery, and injustice?

   But here too we must not confuse the present with the past. With regard
   to the past, no further action is possible. There have been war,
   plague, scandal, and treason, and there is no way of our preventing
   their having taken place; the executioner became an executioner and the
   victim underwent his fate as a victim without us; all that we can do is
   to reveal it, to integrate it into the human heritage, to raise it to
   the dignity of the aesthetic existence which bears within itself its
   finality; but first this history had to occur: it occurred as scandal,
   revolt, crime, or sacrifice, and we were able to try to save it only
   because it first offered us a form. Today must also exist before being
   confirmed in its existence: its destination in such a way that
   everything about it already seemed justified and that there was no more
   of it to reject, then there would also be nothing to say about it, for
   no form would take shape in it; it is revealed only through rejection,
   desire, hate and love. In order for the artist to have a world to
   express he must first be situated in this world, oppressed or
   oppressing, resigned or rebellious, a man among men. But at the heart
   of his existence he finds the exigency which is common to all men; he
   must first will freedom within himself and universally; he must try to
   conquer it: in the light of this project situations are graded and
   reasons for acting are made manifest.

Freedom and Liberation

   One of the chief objections leveled against existentialism is that the
   precept “to will freedom” is only a hollow formula and offers no
   concrete content for action. But that is because one has begun by
   emptying the word freedom of its concrete meaning; we have already seen
   that freedom realizes itself only by engaging itself in the world: to
   such an extent that man’s project toward freedom is embodied for him in
   definite acts of behavior.

   To will freedom and to will to disclose being are one and the same
   choice; hence, freedom takes a positive and constructive step which
   causes being to pass to existence in a movement which is constantly
   surpassed. Science, technics, art, and philosophy are indefinite
   conquests of existence over being; it is by assuming themselves as such
   that they take on their genuine aspect; it is in the light of this
   assumption that the word progress finds its veridical meaning. It is
   not a matter of approaching a fixed limit: absolute Knowledge or the
   happiness of man or the perfection of beauty; all human effort would
   then be doomed to failure, for with each step forward the horizon
   recedes a step; for man it is a matter of pursuing the expansion of his
   existence and of retrieving this very effort as an absolute.

   Science condemns itself to failure when, yielding to the infatuation of
   the serious, it aspires to attain being, to contain it, and to possess
   it; but it finds its truth if it considers itself as a free engagement
   of thought in the given, aiming, at each discovery, not at fusion with
   the thing, but at the possibility of new discoveries; what the mind
   then projects is the concrete accomplishment of its freedom. The
   attempt is sometimes made to find an objective justification of science
   in technics; but ordinarily the mathematician is concerned with
   mathematics and the physicist with physics, and not with their
   applications. And, furthermore, technics itself is not objectively
   justified; if it sets up as absolute goals the saving of time and work
   which it enables us to realize and the comfort and luxury which it
   enables us to have access to, then it appears useless and absurd, for
   the time that one gains can not be accumulated in a store house; it is
   contradictory to want to save up existence, which, the fact is, exists
   only by being spent, and there is a good case for showing that
   airplanes, machines, the telephone, and the radio do not make men of
   today happier than those of former times. But actually it is not a
   question of giving men time and happiness, it is not a question of
   stopping the movement of life: it is a question of fulfilling it. If
   technics is attempting to make up for this lack, which is at the very
   heart of existence, it fails radically; but it escapes all criticism if
   one admits that, through it, existence, far from wishing to repose in
   the security of being, thrusts itself ahead of itself in order to
   thrust itself still farther ahead, that it aims at an indefinite
   disclosure of being by the transformation of the thing into an
   instrument and at the opening of ever new possibilities for man. As for
   art, we have already said that it should not attempt to set up idols;
   it should reveal existence as a reason for existing; that is really why
   Plato, who wanted to wrest man away from the earth and assign him to
   the heaven of Ideas, condemned the poets; that is why every humanism on
   the other hand, crowns them with laurels. Art reveals the transitory as
   an absolute; and as the transitory existence is perpetuated through the
   centuries, art too, through the centuries, must perpetuate this
   never-to-be-finished revelation. Thus, the constructive activities of
   man take on a valid meaning only when they are assumed as a movement
   toward freedom; and reciprocally, one sees that such a movement is
   concrete: discoveries, inventions, industries, culture, paintings, and
   books people the world concretely and open concrete possibilities to
   men.

   Perhaps it is permissible to dream of a future when men will know no
   other use of their freedom than this free unfurling of itself;
   constructive activity would be possible for all; each one would be able
   to aim positively through his projects at his own future. But today the
   fact is that there are men who can justify their life only by a
   negative action. As we have already seen, every man transcends himself.
   But it happens that this transcendence is condemned to fall uselessly
   back upon itself because it is cut off from its goals. That is what
   defines a situation of oppression. Such a situation is never natural:
   man is never oppressed by things; in any case, unless he is a naive
   child who hits stones or a mad prince who orders the sea to be
   thrashed, he does not rebel against things, but only against other men.
   The resistance of the thing sustains the action of man as air sustains
   the flight of the dove; and by projecting himself through it man
   accepts its being an obstacle; he assumes the risk of a setback in
   which he does not see a denial of his freedom. The explorer knows that
   he may be forced to withdraw before arriving at his goal; the
   scientist, that a certain phenomenon may remain obscure to him; the
   technician, that his attempt may prove abortive: these withdrawals and
   errors are another way of disclosing the world. Certainly, a material
   obstacle may cruelly stand in the way of an undertaking: floods,
   earthquakes, grasshoppers, epidemics and plague are scourges; but here
   we have one of the truths of Stoicism: a man must assume even these
   misfortunes, and since he must never resign himself in favor of any
   thing, no destruction of a thing will ever be a radical ruin for him;
   even his death is not an evil since he is man only insofar as he is
   mortal: he must assume it as the natural limit of his life, as the risk
   implied by every step. Only man can be an enemy for man; only he can
   rob him of the meaning of his acts and his life because it also belongs
   only to him alone to confirm it in its existence, to recognize it in
   actual fact as a freedom. It is here that the Stoic distinction between
   “things which do not depend upon us” and those which “depend upon us”
   proves to be insufficient: for “we” is legion and not an individual;
   each one depends upon others, and what happens to me by means of others
   depends upon me as regards its meaning; one does not submit to a war or
   an occupation as he does to an earthquake: he must take sides for or
   against, and the foreign wills thereby become allied or hostile. It is
   this interdependence which explains why oppression is possible and why
   it is hateful. As we have seen, my freedom, in order to fulfill itself,
   requires that it emerge into an open future: it is other men who open
   the future to me, it is they who, setting up the world of tomorrow,
   define my future; but if, instead of allowing me to participate in this
   constructive movement, they oblige me to consume my transcendence in
   vain, if they keep me below the level which they have conquered and on
   the basis of which new conquests will be achieved then they are cutting
   me off from the future, they are changing me into a thing. Life is
   occupied in both perpetuating itself and in surpassing itself; if all
   it does is maintain itself, then living is only not dying, and human
   existence is indistinguishable from an absurd vegetation; a life
   justifies itself only if its effort to perpetuate itself is integrated
   into its surpassing and if this surpassing has no other limits than
   those which the subject assigns himself. Oppression divides the world
   into two clans: those who enlighten mankind by thrusting it ahead of
   itself and those who are condemned to mark time hopelessly in order
   merely to support the collectivity; their life is a pure repetition of
   mechanical gestures; their leisure is just about sufficient for them to
   regain their strength; the oppressor feeds himself on their
   transcendence and refuses to extend it by a free recognition. The
   oppressed has only one solution: to deny the harmony of that mankind
   from which an attempt is made to exclude him, to prove that he is a man
   and that he is free by revolting against the tyrants. In order to
   prevent this revolt, one of the ruses of oppression is to camouflage
   itself behind a natural situation since, after all, one can not revolt
   against nature. When a conservative wishes to show that the proletariat
   is not oppressed, he declares that the present distribution of wealth
   is a natural fact and that there is thus no means of rejecting it; and
   doubtless he has a good case for proving that, strictly speaking, he is
   not stealing from the worker “the product of his labor,” since the word
   theft supposes social conventions which in other respects authorizes
   this type of exploitation; but what the revolutionary means by this
   word is that the present regime is a human fact. As such, it has to be
   rejected. This rejection cuts off the will of the oppressor, in his
   turn, from the future toward which he was hoping to thrust himself
   alone: another future is substituted, that of revolution. The struggle
   is not one of words and ideologies; it is real and concrete, if it is
   this future which triumphs, and not the former, then it is the
   oppressed who is realized as a positive and open freedom and the
   oppressor who becomes an obstacle and a thing.

   There are thus two ways of surpassing the given: it is something quite
   different from taking a trip or escaping from prison. In these two
   cases the given is present in its surpassing; but in one case it is
   present insofar as it is accepted, in the other insofar as rejected,
   and that makes a radical difference. Hegel has confused these two
   movements with the ambiguous term “aufheben”; and the whole structure
   of an optimism which denies failure and death rests on this ambiguity;
   that is what allows one to regard the future of the world as a
   continuous and harmonious development; this confusion is the source and
   also the consequence; it is a perfect epitome of that idealistic and
   verbose flabbiness with which Marx charged Hegel and to which he
   opposed a realistic toughness. Revolt is not integrated into the
   harmonious development of the world; it does not wish to be integrated
   but rather to explode at the heart of the world and to break its
   continuity. It is no accident if Marx defined the attitude of the
   proletariat not positively but negatively: he does not show it as
   affirming itself or as seeking to realize a classless society, but
   rather as first attempting to put an end to itself as a class. And it
   is precisely because it has no other issue than a negative one that
   this situation must be eliminated.

   All men are interested in this elimination, the oppressor as well as
   the oppressed, as Marx himself has said, for each one needs to have all
   men free. There are cases where the slave does not know his servitude
   and where it is necessary to bring the seed of his liberation to him
   from the outside: his submission is not enough to justify the tyranny
   which is imposed upon him. The slave is submissive when one has
   succeeded in mystifying him in such a way that his situation does not
   seem to him to be imposed by men, but to be immediately given by
   nature, by the gods, by the powers against whom revolt has no meaning;
   thus, he does not accept his condition through a resignation of his
   freedom since he can not even dream of any other; and in his
   relationships with his friends, for example, he can live as a free and
   moral man within this world where his ignorance has enclosed him. The
   conservative will argue from this that this peace should not be
   disturbed; it is not necessary to give education to the people or
   comfort to the natives of the colonies; the “ringleaders” should be
   suppressed; that is the meaning of an old story of Maurras: there is no
   need to awaken the sleeper, for that would be to awaken him to
   unhappiness. Certainly it is not a question of throwing men in spite of
   themselves, under the pretext of liberation, into a new world, one
   which they have not chosen, on which they have no grip. The proponents
   of slavery in the Carolinas had a good case when they showed the
   conquerors old negro slaves who were bewildered by a freedom which they
   didn’t know what to do with and who cried for their former masters;
   these false liberations – though in a certain sense they are inevitable
   – overwhelm those who are their victims as if they were a new blow of
   blind fate. What must be done is to furnish the ignorant slave with the
   means of transcending his situation by means of revolt, to put an end
   to his ignorance. We know that the problem of the nineteenth-century
   socialists was precisely to develop a class consciousness in the
   proletariat; we see in the life of Flora Tristan, for example, how
   thankless such a task was: what she wanted for the workers had first to
   be wanted without them. “But what right does one have to want something
   for others?” asks the conservative, who meanwhile regards the
   workingman or the native as “a grown-up child” and who does not
   hesitate to dispose of the child’s will. Indeed, there is nothing more
   arbitrary than intervening as a stranger in a destiny which is not
   ours: one of the shocking things about charity – in the civic sense of
   the word – is that it is practised from the outside, according to the
   caprice of the one who distributes it and who is detached from the
   object. But the cause of freedom is not that of others more than it is
   mine: it is universally human. If I want the slave to become conscious
   of his servitude, it is both in order not to be a tyrant myself – for
   any abstention is complicity, and complicity in this case is tyranny –
   and in order that new possibilities might be opened to the liberated
   slave and through him to all men. To want existence, to want to
   disclose the world, and to want men to be free are one and the same
   will.

   Moreover, the oppressor is lying if he claims that the oppressed
   positively wants oppression; he merely abstains from not wanting it
   because he is unaware of even the possibility of rejection. All that an
   external action can propose is to put the oppressed in the presence of
   his freedom: then he will decide positively and freely. The fact is
   that he decides against oppression, and it is then that the movement of
   emancipation really begins. For if it is true that the cause of freedom
   is the cause of each one, it is also true that the urgency of
   liberation is not the same for all; Marx has rightly said that it is
   only to the oppressed that it appears as immediately necessary. As for
   us, we do not believe in a literal necessity but in a moral exigency;
   the oppressed can fulfill his freedom as a man only in revolt, since
   the essential characteristic of the situation against which he is
   rebelling is precisely its prohibiting him from any positive
   development; it is only in social and political struggle that his
   transcendence passes beyond to the infinite. And certainly the
   proletarian is no more naturally a moral man than another; he can flee
   from his freedom, dissipate it, vegetate without desire, and give
   himself up to an inhuman myth; and the trick of “enlightened”
   capitalism is to make him forget about his concern with genuine
   justification, offering him, when he leaves the factory where a
   mechanical job absorbs his transcendence, diversions in which this
   transcendence ends by petering out: there you have the politics of the
   American employing class which catches the worker in the trap of
   sports, “gadgets,” autos, and frigidaires. On the whole, however, he
   has fewer temptations of betrayal than the members of the privileged
   classes because the satisfying of his passions, the taste for
   adventure, and the satisfactions of social seriousness are denied him.
   And in particular, it is also possible for the bourgeois and the
   intellectual to use their freedom positively at the same time as they
   can cooperate in the struggle against oppression: their future is not
   barred. That is what Ponge, for example, suggests when he writes that
   he is producing “post-revolutionary” literature. The writer, as well as
   the scientist and the technician, has the possibility of realizing,
   before the revolution is accomplished, this re-creation of the world
   which should be the task of every man if freedom were no longer
   enchained anywhere. Whether or not it is desirable to anticipate the
   future, whether men have to give up the positive use of their freedom
   as long as the liberation of all has not yet been achieved, or whether,
   on the contrary, any human fulfillment serves the cause of man, is a
   point about which revolutionary politics itself is still hesitating.
   Even in the Soviet Union itself the relation between the building of
   the future and the present struggle seems to be defined in very
   different ways according to the moment and the circumstances. It is
   also a matter wherein each individual has to invent his solution
   freely. In any case, we can assert that the oppressed is more totally
   engaged in the struggle than those who, though at one with him in
   rejecting his servitude, do not experience it; but also that, on the
   other hand, every man is affected by this struggle in so essential a
   way that he can not fulfill himself morally without taking part in it.

   The problem is complicated in practice by the fact that today
   oppression has more than one aspect: the Arabian fellah is oppressed by
   both the sheiks and the French and English administration; which of the
   two enemies is to be combated? The interests of the French proletariat
   are not the same as those of the natives in the colonies: which are to
   be served? But here the question is political before being moral: we
   must end by abolishing all suppression; each one must carry on his
   struggle in connection with that of the other and by integrating it
   into the general pattern. What order should be followed? What tactics
   should be adopted? It is a matter of opportunity and efficiency. For
   each one it also depends upon his individual situation. It is possible
   that he may be led to sacrifice temporarily a cause whose success is
   subordinate to that of a cause whose defense is more urgent; on the
   other hand, it is possible that one may judge it necessary to maintain
   the tension of revolt against a situation to which one does not wish to
   consent at any price: thus, during the war, when Negro leaders in
   America were asked to drop their own claims for the sake of the general
   interest, Richard Wright refused; he thought that even in time of war
   his cause had to be defended. In any case, morality requires that the
   combatant be not blinded by the goal which he sets up for himself to
   the point of falling into the fanaticism of seriousness or passion. The
   cause which he serves must not lock itself up and thus create a new
   element of separation: through his own struggle he must seek to serve
   the universal cause of freedom.

   At once the oppressor raises an objection: under the pretext of
   freedom, he says, there you go oppressing me in turn; you deprive me of
   my freedom. It is the argument which the Southern slaveholders opposed
   to the abolitionists, and we know that the Yankees were so imbued with
   the principles of an abstract democracy that they did not grant that
   they had the right to deny the Southern planters the freedom to own
   slaves; the Civil War broke out with a completely formal pretext. We
   smile at such scruples; yet today America still recognizes more or less
   implicitly that Southern whites have the freedom to lynch negroes. And
   it is the same sophism which is innocently displayed in the newspapers
   of the P.R.L. (Parti Republicain de la Liberte) and, more or less
   subtly, in all conservative organs. When a party promises the directing
   classes that it will defend their freedom, it means quite plainly that
   it demands that they have the freedom of exploiting the working class.
   A claim of this kind does not outrage us in the name of abstract
   justice; but a contradiction is dishonestly concealed there. For a
   freedom wills itself genuinely only by willing itself as an indefinite
   movement through the freedom of others; as soon as it withdraws into
   itself, it denies itself on behalf of some object which it prefers to
   itself: we know well enough what sort of freedom the P.R.L. demands: it
   is property, the feeling of possession, capital, comfort, moral
   security. We have to respect freedom only when it is intended for
   freedom, not when it strays, flees itself, and resigns itself. A
   freedom which is interested only in denying freedom must be denied. And
   it is not true that the recognition of the freedom of others limits my
   own freedom: to be free is not to have the power to do anything you
   like; it is to be able to surpass the given toward an open future; the
   existence of others as a freedom defines my situation and is even the
   condition of my own freedom. I am oppressed if I am thrown into prison,
   but not if I am kept from throwing my neighbor into prison.

   Indeed, the oppressor himself is conscious of this sophism; he hardly
   dares to have recourse to it; rather than make an unvarnished demand
   for freedom to oppress he is more apt to present himself as the
   defender of certain values. It is not in his own name that he is
   fighting, but rather in the name of civilization, of institutions, of
   monuments, and of virtues which realize objectively the situation which
   he intends to maintain; he declares that all these things are beautiful
   and good in themselves; he defends a past which has assumed the icy
   dignity of being against an uncertain future whose values have not yet
   been won; this is what is well expressed by the label “conservative.”
   As some people are curators of a museum or a collection of medals,
   others make themselves the curators of the given world; stressing the
   sacrifices that are necessarily involved in all change, they side with
   what has been over against what has not yet been.

   It is quite certain that the surpassing of the past toward the future
   always demands sacrifices; to claim that in destroying an old quarter
   in order to build new houses on its ruins one is preserving it
   dialectically is a play on words; no dialectic can restore the old port
   of Marseilles; the past as something not surpassed, in its flesh and
   blood presence, has completely vanished. All that a stubborn optimism
   can claim is that the past does not concern us in this particular and
   fixed form and that we have sacrificed nothing in sacrificing it; thus,
   many revolutionaries consider it healthy to refuse any attachment to
   the past and to profess to scorn monuments and traditions. A left-wing
   journalist who was fuming impatiently in a street of Pompeii said,
   “What are we doing here? We’re wasting our time.” This attitude is
   self-confirming; let us turn away from the past, and there no longer
   remains any trace of it in the present, or for the future; the people
   of the Middle Ages had so well forgotten antiquity that there was no
   longer anyone who even had a desire to know something about it. One can
   live without Greek, without Latin, without cathedrals, and without
   history. Yes, but there are many other things that one can live
   without; the tendency of man is not to reduce himself but to increase
   his power. To abandon the past to the night of facticity is a way of
   depopulating the world. I would distrust a humanism which was too
   indifferent to the efforts of the men of former times; if the
   disclosure of being achieved by our ancestors does not at all move us,
   why be so interested in that which is taking place today; why wish so
   ardently for future realizations? To assert the reign of the human is
   to acknowledge man in the past as well as in the future. The Humanists
   of the Renaissance are an example of the help to be derived by a
   movement of liberation from being rooted in the past; no doubt the
   study of Greek and Latin does not have this living force in every age;
   but in any case, the fact of having a past is part of the human
   condition; if the world behind us were bare, we would hardly be able to
   see anything before us but a gloomy desert. We must try, through our
   living projects, to turn to our own account that freedom which was
   undertaken in the past and to integrate it into the present world.

   But on the other hand, we know that if the past concerns us, it does so
   not as a brute fact, but insofar as it has human signification; if this
   signification can be recognized only by a project which refuses the
   legacy of the past, then this legacy must be refused; it would be
   absurd to uphold against man a datum which is precious only insofar as
   the freedom of man is expressed in it. There is one country where the
   cult of the past is erected into a system more than anywhere else: it
   is the Portugal of today; but it is at the cost of a deliberate
   contempt for man. Salazar has had brand-new castles built, at great
   expense, on all the hills where there were ruins standing, and at
   Obidos he had no hesitation in appropriating for this restoration the
   funds that were to go to the maternity hospital, which, as a result,
   had to be closed; on the outskirts of Coimbre where a children’s
   community was to be set up, he spent so much money having the different
   types of old Portuguese houses reproduced on a reduced scale that
   barely four children could be lodged in this monstrous village. Dances,
   songs, local festivals, and the wearing of old regional costumes are
   encouraged everywhere: they never open a school. Here we see, in its
   extreme form, the absurdity of a choice which prefers the Thing to Man
   from whom alone the Thing can receive its value. We may be moved by
   dances, songs, and regional costumes because these inventions represent
   the only free accomplishment which was allowed the peasants amidst the
   hard conditions under which they formerly lived; by means of these
   creations they tore themselves away from their servile work,
   transcended their situation, and asserted themselves as men before the
   beasts of burden. Wherever these festivals still exist spontaneously,
   where they have retained this character, they have their meaning and
   their value. But when they are ceremoniously reproduced for the
   edification of indifferent tourists, they are no more than a boring
   documentary, even an odious mystification. It is a sophism to want to
   maintain by coercion things which derive their worth from the fact that
   men attempted through them to escape from coercion. In like manner, all
   those who oppose old lace, rugs, peasant coifs, picturesque houses,
   regional costumes, hand-made cloth, old language, etcetera, to social
   evolution know very well that they are dishonest: they themselves do
   not much value the present reality of these things, and most of the
   time their lives clearly show it. To be sure, they treat those who do
   not recognize the unconditional value of an Alencon point as
   ignoramuses; but at heart they know that these objects are less
   precious in themselves than as the manifestation of the civilization
   which they represent. They are crying up the patience and the
   submission of industrious hands which were one with their needle as
   much as they are the lace. We also know that the Nazis made very
   handsome bindings and lampshades out of human skin.

   Thus, oppression can in no way justify itself in the name of the
   content which it is defending and which it dishonestly sets up as an
   idol. Bound up with the subjectivity which established it, this content
   requires its own surpassing. One does not love the past in its living
   truth if he insists on preserving its hardened and mummified forms. The
   past is an appeal; it is an appeal toward the future which sometimes
   can save it only by destroying it. Even though this destruction may be
   a sacrifice, it would be a lie to deny it: since man wants there to be
   being, he can not renounce any form of being without regret. But a
   genuine ethics does not teach us either to sacrifice it or deny it: we
   must assume it.

   The oppressor does not merely try to justify himself as a conserver.
   Often he tries to invoke future realizations; he speaks in the name of
   the future. Capitalism sets itself up as the regime which is most
   favorable to production; the colonist is the only one capable of
   exploiting the wealth which the native would leave fallow. Oppression
   tries to defend itself by its utility. But we have seen that it is one
   of the lies of the serious mind to attempt to give the word “useful” an
   absolute meaning; nothing is useful if it is not useful to man; nothing
   is useful to man if the latter is not in a position to define his own
   ends and values, if he is not free. Doubtless an oppressive regime can
   achieve constructions which will serve man: they will serve him only
   from the day that he is free to use them; as long as the reign of the
   oppressor lasts, none of the benefits of oppression is a real benefit.
   Neither in the past nor in the future can one prefer a thing to man,
   who alone can establish the reason for all things.

   Finally, the oppressor has a good case for showing that respect for
   freedom is never without difficulty, and perhaps he may even assert
   that one can never respect all freedoms at the same time. But that
   simply means that man must accept the tension of the struggle, that his
   liberation must actively seek to perpetuate itself, without aiming at
   an impossible state of equilibrium and rest; this does not mean that he
   ought to prefer the sleep of slavery to this incessant conquest.
   Whatever the problems raised for him, the setbacks that he will have to
   assume, and the difficulties with which he will have to struggle, he
   must reject oppression at any cost.

The Antinomies of Action

   As we have seen, if the oppressor were aware of the demands of his own
   freedom, he himself should have to denounce oppression. But he is
   dishonest; in the name of the serious or of his passions, of his will
   for power or of his appetites, he refuses to give up his privileges. In
   order for a liberating action to be a thoroughly moral action, it would
   have to be achieved through a conversion of the oppressors: there would
   then be a reconciliation of all freedoms. But no one any longer dares
   to abandon himself today to these utopian reveries. We know only too
   well that we can not count upon a collective conversion. However, by
   virtue of the fact that the oppressors refuse to co-operate in the
   affirmation of freedom, they embody, in the eyes of all men of good
   will, the absurdity of facticity; by calling for the triumph of freedom
   over facticity, ethics also demands that they be suppressed; and since
   their subjectivity, by definition, escapes our control, it will be
   possible to act only on their objective presence; others will here have
   to be treated like things, with violence; the sad fact of the
   separation of men will thereby be confirmed. Thus, here is the
   oppressor oppressed in turn; and the men who do violence to him in
   their turn become masters, tyrants, and executioners: in revolting, the
   oppressed are metamorphosed into a blind force, a brutal fatality; the
   evil which divides the world is carried out in their own hearts. And
   doubtless it is not a question of backing out of these consequences,
   for the ill-will of the oppressor imposes upon each one the alternative
   of being the enemy of the oppressed if he is not that of their tyrant;
   evidently, it is necessary to choose to sacrifice the one who is an
   enemy of man; but the fact is that one finds himself forced to treat
   certain men as things in order to win the freedom of all.

   A freedom which is occupied in denying freedom is itself so outrageous
   that the outrageousness of the violence which one practices against it
   is almost cancelled out: hatred, indignation, and anger (which even the
   Marxist cultivates, despite the cold impartiality of the doctrine) wipe
   out all scruples. But the oppressor would not be so strong if he did
   not have accomplices among the oppressed themselves; mystification is
   one of the forms of oppression; ignorance is a situation in which man
   may be enclosed as narrowly as in a prison; as we have already said,
   every individual may practice his freedom inside his world, but not
   everyone has the means of rejecting, even by doubt, the values, taboos,
   and prescriptions by which he is surrounded; doubtless, respectful
   minds take the object of their respect for their own; in this sense
   they are responsible for it, as they are responsible for their presence
   in the world: but they are not guilty if their adhesion is not a
   resignation of their freedom. When a young sixteen-year old Nazi died
   crying, “Heil Hitler!” he was not guilty, and it was not he whom we
   hated but his masters. The desirable thing would be to re-educate this
   misled youth; it would be necessary to expose the mystification and to
   put the men who are its victims in the presence of their freedom. But
   the urgency of the struggle forbids this slow labor. We are obliged to
   destroy not only the oppressor but also those who serve him, whether
   they do so out of ignorance or out of constraint.

   As we have also seen, the situation of the world is so complex that one
   can not fight everywhere at the same time and for everyone. In order to
   win an urgent victory, one has to give up the idea, at least
   temporarily, of serving certain valid causes; one may even be brought
   to the point of fighting against them. Thus, during the course of the
   last war, no Anti-fascist could have wanted the revolts of the natives
   in the British Empire to be successful; on the contrary, these revolts
   were supported by the Fascist regimes; and yet, we can not blame those
   who, considering their emancipation to be the more urgent action, took
   advantage of the situation to obtain it. Thus, it is possible, and
   often it even happens, that one finds himself obliged to oppress and
   kill men who are pursuing goals whose validity one acknowledges
   himself.

   But that is not the worst thing to be said for violence. It not only
   forces us to sacrifice the men who are in our way, but also those who
   are fighting on our side, and even ourselves. Since we can conquer our
   enemies only by acting upon their facticity, by reducing them to
   things, we have to make ourselves things; in this struggle in which
   wills are forced to confront each other through their bodies, the
   bodies of our allies, like those of our opponents are exposed to the
   same brutal hazard: they will be wounded, killed, or starved. Every
   war, every revolution, demands the sacrifice of a generation, of a
   collectivity, by those who undertake it. And even outside of periods of
   crisis when blood flows, the permanent possibility of violence can
   constitute between nations and classes a state of veiled warfare in
   which individuals are sacrificed in a permanent way.

   Thus one finds himself in the presence of the paradox that no action
   can be generated for man without its being immediately generated
   against men. This obvious truth, which is universally known, is,
   however, so bitter that the first concern of a doctrine of action is
   ordinarily to mask this element of failure that is involved in any
   undertaking. The parties of oppression beg the question; they deny the
   value of what they sacrifice in such a way that they find that they are
   sacrificing nothing. Passing dishonestly from the serious to nihilism,
   they set up both the unconditioned value of their end and the
   insignificance of the men whom they are using as instruments. High as
   it may be, the number of victims is always measurable; and each one
   taken one by one is never anything but an individual: yet, through time
   and space, the triumph of the cause embraces the infinite, it interests
   the whole collectivity. In order to deny the outrage it is enough to
   deny the importance of the individual, even though it be at the cost of
   this collectivity: it is everything, he is only a zero.

   In one sense the individual, as a matter of fact, is not very much, and
   we can understand the misanthrope who in 1939 declared: “After all,
   when you look at people one by one, it doesn’t seem so awful a thing to
   make war upon them.” Reduced to pure facticity, congealed in his
   immanence, cut off from his future, deprived of his transcendence and
   of the world which that transcendence discloses, a man no longer
   appears as anything more than a thing among things which can be
   subtracted from the collectivity of other things without its leaving
   upon the earth any trace of its absence. Multiply this paltry existence
   by thousands of copies and its insignificance remains; mathematics also
   teaches us that zero multiplied by any finite number remains zero. It
   is even possible that the wretchedness of each element is only further
   affirmed by this futile expansion. Horror is sometimes self-destructive
   before the photographs of the charnel-houses of Buchenwald and Dachau
   and of the ditches strewn with bones; it takes on the aspect of
   indifference; that decomposed, that animal flesh seems so essentially
   doomed to decay that one can no longer even regret that it has
   fulfilled its destiny; it is when a man is alive that his death appears
   to be an outrage, but a corpse has the stupid tranquillity of trees and
   stones: those who have done it say that it is easy to walk on a corpse
   and still easier to walk over a pile of corpses; and it is the same
   reason that accounts for the callousness described by those deportees
   who escaped death: through sickness, pain, hunger, and death, they no
   longer saw their comrades and themselves as anything more than an
   animal horde whose life or desires were no longer justified by
   anything, whose very revolts were only the agitations of animals. In
   order to remain capable of perceiving man through these humiliated
   bodies one had to be sustained by political faith, intellectual pride,
   or Christian charity. That is why the Nazis were so systematically
   relentless in casting into abjection the men they wanted to destroy:
   the disgust which the victims felt in regard to themselves stifled the
   voice of revolt and justified the executioners in their own eyes. All
   oppressive regimes become stronger through the degradation of the
   oppressed. In Algeria I have seen any number of colonists appease their
   conscience by the contempt in which they held the Arabs who were
   crushed with misery: the more miserable the latter were, the more
   contemptible they seemed, so much so that there was never any room for
   remorse. And the truth is that certain tribes in the south were so
   ravaged by disease and famine that one could no longer feel either
   rebellious or hopeful regarding them; rather, one wished for the death
   of those unhappy creatures who have been reduced to so elemental an
   animality that even the maternal instinct has been suppressed in them.
   Yet, with all this sordid resignation, there were children who played
   and laughed; and their smile exposed the lie of their oppressors: it
   was an appeal and a promise; it projected a future before the child, a
   man’s future. If, in all oppressed countries, a child’s face is so
   moving, it is not that the child is more moving or that he has more of
   a right to happiness than the others: it is that he is the living
   affirmation of human transcendence: he is on the watch, he is an eager
   hand held out to the world, he is a hope, a project. The trick of
   tyrants is to enclose a man in the immanence of his facticity and to
   try to forget that man is always, as Heidegger puts it, “infinitely
   more than what he would be if he were reduced to being what he is;” man
   is a being of the distances, a movement toward the future, a project.
   The tyrant asserts himself as a transcendence; he considers others as
   pure immanences: he thus arrogates to himself the right to treat them
   like cattle. We see the sophism on which his conduct is based: of the
   ambiguous condition which is that of all men, he retains for himself
   the only aspect of a transcendence which is capable of justifying
   itself; for the others, the contingent and unjustified aspect of
   immanence.

   But if that kind of contempt for man is convenient, it is also
   dangerous; the feeling of abjection can confirm men in a hopeless
   resignation but can not incite them to the struggle and sacrifice which
   is consented to with their life; this was seen in the time of the Roman
   decadence when men lost their zest for life and the readiness to risk
   it. In any case, the tyrant himself does not openly set up this
   contempt as a universal principle: it is the Jew, the negro, or the
   native whom he encloses in his immanence; with his subordinates and his
   soldiers he uses different language. For it is quite clear that if the
   individual is a pure zero, the sum of those zeros which make up the
   collectivity is also a zero: no undertaking has any importance, no
   defeat as well as no victory. In order to appeal to the devotion of his
   troops, the chief or the authoritarian party will utilize a truth which
   is the opposite of the one which sanctions their brutal oppression:
   namely, that the value of the individual is asserted only in his
   surpassing. This is one of the aspects of the doctrine of Hegel which
   the dictatorial regimes readily make use of. And it is a point at which
   fascist ideology and Marxist ideology converge. A doctrine which aims
   at the liberation of man evidently can not rest on a contempt for the
   individual; but it can propose to him no other salvation than his
   subordination to the collectivity. The finite is nothing if it is not
   its transition to the infinite; the death of an individual is not a
   failure if it is integrated into a project which surpasses the limits
   of life, the substance of this life being outside of the individual
   himself, in the class, in the socialist State; if the individual is
   taught to consent to his sacrifice, the latter is abolished as such,
   and the soldier who has renounced himself in favor of his cause will
   die joyfully; in fact, that is how the young Hitlerians died.

   We know how many edifying speeches this philosophy has inspired: it is
   by losing oneself that one finds himself, by dying that one fulfills
   his life, by accepting servitude that one realizes his freedom; all
   leaders of men preach in this vein. And if there are any who refuse to
   heed this language, they are wrong, they are cowards: as such, they are
   worthless, they aren’t worth anyone’s bothering with them. The brave
   man dies gaily, of his own free will; the one who rejects death
   deserves only to die. There you have the problem elegantly resolved.

   But one may ask whether this convenient solution is not
   self-contesting. In Hegel the individual is only an abstract moment in
   the History of absolute Mind. This is explained by the first intuition
   of the system which, identifying the real and the rational, empties the
   human world of its sensible thickness; if the truth of the here and now
   is only Space and Time, if the truth of one’s cause is its passage into
   the other, then the attachment to the individual substance of life is
   evidently an error, an inadequate attitude. The essential moment of
   Hegelian ethics is the moment when consciousnesses recognize one
   another; in this operation the other is recognized as identical with
   me, which means that in myself it is the universal truth of my self
   which alone is recognized; so individuality is denied, and it can no
   longer reappear except on the natural and contingent plane; moral
   salvation will lie in my surpassing toward that other who is equal to
   myself and who in turn will surpass himself toward another. Hegel
   himself recognizes that if this passage continued indefinitely,
   Totality would never be achieved, the real would peter out in the same
   measure: one can not, without absurdity, indefinitely sacrifice each
   generation to the following one; human history would then be only an
   endless succession of negations which would never return to the
   positive; all action would be destruction and life would be a vain
   flight. We must admit that there will be a recovery of the real and
   that all sacrifices will find their positive form within the absolute
   Mind. But this does not work without some difficulty. The Mind is a
   subject; but who is a subject? After Descartes how can we ignore the
   fact that subjectivity radically signifies separation? And if it is
   admitted, at the cost of a contradiction, that the subject will be the
   men of the future reconciled, it must be clearly recognized that the
   men of today who turn out to have been the substance of the real, and
   not subjects, remain excluded forever from this reconciliation.
   Furthermore, even Hegel retreats from the idea of this motionless
   future; since Mind is restlessness, the dialectic of struggle and
   conciliation can never be stopped: the future which it envisages is not
   the perpetual peace of Kant but an indefinite state of war. It declares
   that this war will no longer appear as a temporary evil in which each
   individual makes a gift of himself to the State; but it is precisely at
   this point that there is a bit of sleight-of-hand: for why would he
   agree to this gift since the State can not be the achieving of the real
   Totality recovering itself? The whole system seems like a huge
   mystification, since it subordinates all its moments to an end term
   whose coming it dares not set up; the individual renounces himself; but
   no reality in favor of which he can renounce himself is ever affirmed
   or recovered. Through all this learned dialectic we finally come back
   to the sophism which we exposed: if the individual is nothing, society
   can not be something. Take his substance away from him, and the State
   has no more substance; if he has nothing to sacrifice, there is nothing
   before him to sacrifice to. Hegelian fullness immediately passes into
   the nothingness of absence. And the very grandeur of that failure makes
   this truth shine forth: only the subject can justify his own existence;
   no external subject, no object, can bring him salvation from the
   outside. He can not be regarded as a nothing, since the consciousness
   of all things is within him.

   Thus, nihilistic pessimism and rationalistic optimism fail in their
   effort to juggle away the bitter truth of sacrifice: they also
   eliminate all reasons for wanting it. Someone told a young invalid who
   wept because she had to leave her home, her occupations, and her whole
   past life, “Get cured. The rest has no importance.” “But if nothing has
   any importance,” she answered, “what good is it to get cured?” She was
   right. In order for this world to have any importance, in order for our
   undertaking to have a meaning and to be worthy of sacrifices, we must
   affirm the concrete and particular thickness of this world and the
   individual reality of our projects and ourselves. This is what
   democratic societies understand; they strive to confirm citizens in the
   feeling of their individual value; the whole ceremonious apparatus of
   baptism, marriage, and burial is the collectivity’s homage to the
   individual; and the rites of justice seek to manifest society’s respect
   for each of its members considered in his particularity. After or
   during a period of violence when men are treated like objects, one is
   astonished, even irritated, at seeing human life rediscover, in certain
   cases, a sacred character. Why those hesitations of the courts, those
   long drawn-out trials, since men died by the million, like animals,
   since the very ones being judged coldly massacred them? The reason is
   that once the period of crisis, in which the democracies themselves,
   whether they liked it or not, had to resort to blind violence, has
   passed, they aim to re-establish the individual within his rights; more
   than ever they must restore to their members the sense of their
   dignity, the sense of the dignity of each man, taken one by one; the
   soldier must become a citizen again so that the city may continue to
   subsist as such, may continue to deserve one’s dedicating oneself to
   it.

   But if the individual is set up as a unique and irreducible value, the
   word sacrifice regains all its meaning; what a man loses in renouncing
   his plans, his future, and his life no longer appears as a negligible
   thing. Even if he decides that in order to justify his life he must
   consent to limiting its course, even if he accepts dying, there is a
   wrench at the heart of this acceptance, for freedom demands both that
   it recover itself as an absolute and that it prolong its movement
   indefinitely: it is through this indefinite movement that it desires to
   come back to itself and to confirm itself; now, death puts an end to
   his drive; the hero can transcend death toward a future fulfillment,
   but he will not be present in that future; this must be understood if
   one wishes to restore to heroism its true worth: it is neither natural
   nor easy; the hero may overcome his regret and carry out his sacrifice;
   the latter is none the less an absolute renunciation. The death of
   those to whom we are attached by particular ties will also be consented
   to as an individual and irreducible misfortune. A collectivist
   conception of man does not concede a valid existence to such sentiments
   as love, tenderness, and friendship; the abstract identity of
   individuals merely authorizes a comradeship between them by means of
   which each one is likened to each of the others. In marching, in choral
   singing, in common work and struggle, all the others appear as the
   same; nobody ever dies. On the contrary, if individuals recognize
   themselves in their differences, individual relations are established
   among them, and each one becomes irreplaceable for a few others. And
   violence does not merely provoke in the world the wrench of the
   sacrifice to which one has consented; it is also undergone in revolt
   and refusal. Even the one who desires a victory and who knows that it
   has to be paid for will wonder: why with my blood rather than with
   another’s? Why is it my son who is dead? And we have seen that every
   struggle obliges us to sacrifice people whom our victory does not
   concern, people who, in all honesty, reject it as a cataclysm: these
   people will die in astonishment, anger or despair. Undergone as a
   misfortune, violence appears as a crime to the one who practices it.
   That is why Saint-Just, who believed in the individual and who knew
   that all authority is violence, said with somber lucidity, “No one
   governs innocently.”

   We may well assume that not all those who govern have the courage to
   make such a confession; and furthermore it might be dangerous for them
   to make it too loudly. They try to mask the crime from themselves; at
   least they try to conceal it from the notice of those who submit to
   their law. If they can not totally deny it, they attempt to justify it.
   The most radical justification would be to demonstrate that it is
   necessary: it then ceases to be a crime, it becomes fatality. Even if
   an end is posited as necessary, the contingency of the means renders
   the chief’s decisions arbitrary, and each individual suffering appears
   as unjustified: why this bloody revolution instead of slow reforms? And
   who will dare to designate the victim who is anonymously demanded by
   the general plan? On the contrary, if only one way shows itself to be
   possible, if the unrolling of history is fatal, there is no longer any
   place for the anguish of choice, or for regret, or for outrage; revolt
   can no longer surge up in any heart. This is what makes historical
   materialism so reassuring a doctrine; the troublesome idea of a
   subjective caprice or an objective chance is thereby eliminated. The
   thought and the voice of the directors merely reflect the fatal
   exigencies of History. But in order that this faith be living and
   efficacious, it is necessary that no reflection mediatize the
   subjectivity of the chiefs and make it appear as such; if the chief
   considers that he does not simply reflect the given situation but that
   he is interpreting it, he becomes a prey to anguish: who am I to
   believe in myself? And if the soldier’s eyes open, he too asks: who is
   he to command me? Instead of a prophet, he sees nothing more than a
   tyrant. That is why every authoritarian party regards thought as a
   danger and reflection as a crime; it is by means of thought that crime
   appears as such in the world. This is one of the meanings of Koestler’s
   Darkness at Noon. Roubatchov easily slips into confession because he
   feels that hesitation and doubt are the most radical, the most
   unpardonable of faults; they undermine the world of objectivity much
   more than does an act of capricious disobedience. Yet, however cruel
   the yoke may be, in spite of the purges, murders, and deportations,
   every regime has opponents: there are reflection, doubt, and
   contestation. And even if the opponent is in the wrong, his error
   brings to light a truth, namely, that there is a place in this world
   for error and subjectivity; whether he is right or wrong, he triumphs;
   he shows that the men who are in power may also be mistaken. And
   furthermore, the latter know it; they know that they hesitate and that
   their decisions are risky. The doctrine of necessity is much more a
   weapon than a faith; and if they use it, they do so because they know
   well enough that the soldier may act otherwise than he does, otherwise
   than the way they want him to, that he may disobey; they know well
   enough that he is free and that they are fettering his freedom. It is
   the first sacrifice that they impose upon him: in order to achieve the
   liberation of men he has to give up his own freedom, even his freedom
   of thought. In order to mask the violence, what they do is to have
   recourse to a new violence which even invades his mind.

   Very well, replies the partisan who is sure of his aims, but this
   violence is useful. And the justification which he here invokes is that
   which, in the most general way, inspires and legitimizes all action.
   From conservatives to revolutionaries, through idealistic and moral
   vocabularies or realistic and positive ones, the outrageousness of
   violence is excused in the name of utility. It does not much matter
   that the action is not fatally commanded by anterior events as long as
   it is called for by the proposed end; this end sets up the means which
   are subordinated to it; and thanks to this subordination, one can
   perhaps not avoid sacrifice but one can legitimize it: this is what is
   important to the man of action; like Saint-Just, he accepts the loss of
   his innocence. It is the arbitrariness of the crime that is repugnant
   to him more than the crime itself. If the sacrifices which have been
   assented to find their rational place within the enterprise, one
   escapes from the anguish of decision and from remorse. But one has to
   win out; defeat would change the murders and destruction into
   unjustified outrage, since they would have been carried out in vain;
   but victory gives meaning and utility to all the misfortunes which have
   helped bring it about.

   Such a position would be solid and satisfactory if the word useful had
   an absolute meaning in itself; as we have seen, the characteristic of
   the spirit of seriousness is precisely to confer a meaning upon it by
   raising the Thing or the Cause to the dignity of an unconditioned end.
   The only problem then raised is a technical problem; the means will be
   chosen according to their effectiveness, their speed, and their
   economy; it is simply a question of measuring the relationships of the
   factors of time, cost, and probability of success. Furthermore, in
   war-time discipline spares the subordinates the problems of such
   calculations; they concern only the staff. The soldier does not call
   into question either the aim or the means of attaining it: he obeys
   without any discussion. However, what distinguishes war and politics
   from all other techniques is that the material that is employed is a
   human material. Now human efforts and lives can no more be treated as
   blind instruments than human work can be treated as simple merchandise;
   at the same time as he is a means for attaining an end, man is himself
   an end. The word useful requires a complement, and there can be only
   one: man himself. And the most disciplined soldier would mutiny if
   skillful propaganda did not persuade him that he is dedicating himself
   to the cause of man: to his cause.

   But is the cause of Man that of each man? That is what utilitarian
   ethics has been striving to demonstrate since Hegel; if one wishes to
   give the word useful a universal and absolute meaning, it is always a
   question of reabsorbing each man into the bosom of mankind; it is said
   that despite the weaknesses of the flesh and that particular fear which
   each one experiences in the face of his particular death, the real
   interest of each one is mingled with the general interest. And it is
   true that each is bound to all; but that is precisely the ambiguity of
   his condition: in his surpassing toward others, each one exists
   absolutely as for himself; each is interested in the liberation of all,
   but as a separate existence engaged in his own projects. So much so
   that the terms “useful to Man,” “useful to this man,” do not overlap.
   Universal, absolute man exists nowhere. From this angle, we again come
   upon the same antinomy: the only justification of sacrifice is its
   utility; but the useful is what serves Man. Thus, in order to serve
   some men we must do disservice to others. By what principle are we to
   choose between them?

   It must again be called to mind that the supreme end at which man must
   aim is his freedom, which alone is capable of establishing the value of
   every end; thus, comfort, happiness, all relative goods which human
   projects define, will be subordinated to this absolute condition of
   realization. The freedom of a single man must count more than a cotton
   or rubber harvest; although this principle is not respected in fact, it
   is usually recognized theoretically. But what makes the problem so
   difficult is that it is a matter of choosing between the negation of
   one freedom or another: every war supposes a discipline, every
   revolution a dictatorship, every political move a certain amount of
   lying; action implies all forms of enslaving, from murder to
   mystification. Is it therefore absurd in every case? Or, in spite of
   everything, are we able to find, within the very outrage that it
   implies, reasons for wanting one thing rather than another?

   One generally takes numerical considerations into account by a strange
   compromise which clearly shows that every action treats men both as a
   means and as an end, as an external object and as an inwardness; it is
   better to save the lives of ten men than of only one. Thus, one treats
   man as an end, for to set up quantity as a value is to set up the
   positive value of each unit; but it is setting it up as a quantifiable
   value, thus, as an externality. I have known a Kantian rationalist who
   passionately maintained that it is as immoral to choose the death of a
   single man as to let ten thousand die; he was right in the sense that
   in each murder the outrage is total; ten thousand dead – there are
   never ten thousand copies of a single death; no multiplication is
   relevant to subjectivity. But he forgot that for the one who had the
   decision to make men are given, nevertheless, as objects that can be
   counted; it is therefore logical, though this logic implies an
   outrageous absurdity, to prefer the salvation of the greater number.
   Moreover, this position of the problem is rather abstract, for one
   rarely bases a choice on pure quantity. Those men among whom one
   hesitates have functions in society. The general who is sparing of the
   lives of his soldiers saves them as human material that it is useful to
   save for tomorrow’s battles or for the reconstruction of the country;
   and he sometimes condemns to death thousands of civilians whose fate he
   is not concerned with in order to spare the lives of a hundred soldiers
   or ten specialists. An extreme case is the one David Rousset describes
   in The Days of Our Death: the S.S. obliged the responsible members of
   the concentration camps to designate which prisoners were to go to the
   gas chambers. The politicians agreed to assume this responsibility
   because they thought that they had a valid principle of selection: they
   protected the politicians of their party because the lives of these men
   who were devoted to a cause which they thought was just seemed to them
   to be the most useful to preserve. We know that the communists have
   been widely accused of this partiality; however, since one could in no
   way escape the atrocity of these massacres, the only thing to do was to
   try, as far as possible, to rationalize it.

   It seems as if we have hardly advanced, for we come back, in the end,
   to the statement that what appears as useful is to sacrifice the less
   useful men to the more useful. But even this shift from useful to
   useful will enlighten us: the complement of the word useful is the word
   man, but it is also the word future. It is man insofar as he is,
   according to the formula of Ponge, “the future of man.” Indeed, cut off
   from his transcendence, reduced to the facticity of his presence, an
   individual is nothing; it is by his project that he fulfills himself,
   by the end at which he aims that he justifies himself; thus, this
   justification is always to come. Only the future can take the present
   for its own and keep it alive by surpassing it. A choice will become
   possible in the light of the future, which is the meaning of tomorrow
   because the present appears as the facticity which must be transcended
   toward freedom. No action is conceivable without this sovereign
   affirmation of the future. But we still have to agree upon what
   underlies this word.

The Present and the Future

   The word future has two meanings corresponding to the two aspects of
   the ambiguous condition of man which is lack of being and which is
   existence; it alludes to both being and existence. When I envisage my
   future, I consider that movement which, prolonging my existence of
   today, will fulfill my present projects and will surpass them toward
   new ends: the future is the definite direction of a particular
   transcendence and it is so closely bound up with the present that it
   composes with it a single temporal form; this is the future which
   Heidegger considered as a reality which is given at each moment. But
   through the centuries men have dreamed of another future in which it
   might be granted them to retrieve themselves as beings in Glory,
   Happiness, or Justice; this future did not prolong the present; it came
   down upon the world like a cataclysm announced by signs which cut the
   continuity of time: by a Messiah, by meteors, by the trumpets of the
   Last Judgment. By transporting the kingdom of God to heaven, Christians
   have almost stripped it of its temporal character, although it was
   promised to the believer only at the end of his life. It was the
   anti-Christian humanism of the eighteenth century which brought the
   myth down to earth again. Then, through the idea of progress, an idea
   of the future was elaborated in which its two aspects fused: the future
   appeared both as the meaning of our transcendence and as the immobility
   of being; it is human, terrestrial, and the resting-place of things. It
   is in this form that it is hesitantly reflected in the systems of Hegel
   and of Comte. It is in this form that it is so often invoked today as a
   unity of the World or as a finished socialist State. In both cases the
   Future appears as both the infinite and as Totality, as number and as
   unity of conciliation; it is the abolition of the negative, it is
   fullness, happiness. One might surmise that any sacrifice already made
   might be claimed in its name. However great the quantity of men
   sacrificed today, the quantity that will profit by their sacrifice is
   infinitely greater; on the other hand, in the face of the positivity of
   the future, the present is only the negative which must be eliminated
   as such: only by dedicating itself to this positivity can the negative
   henceforth return to the positive. The present is the transitory
   existence which is made in order to be abolished: it retrieves itself
   only by transcending itself toward the permanence of future being; it
   is only as an instrument, as a means, it is only by its efficacity with
   regard to the coming of the future that the present is validly
   realized: reduced to itself it is nothing, one may dispose of it as he
   pleases. That is the ultimate meaning of the formula: the end justifies
   the means: all means are authorized by their very indifference. Thus,
   some serenely think that the present oppression has no importance if,
   through it, the World can be fulfilled as such: then, within the
   harmonious equilibrium of work and wealth, oppression will be wiped out
   by itself. Others serenely think that the present dictatorship of a
   party with its lies and violence has no importance if, by means of it,
   the socialist State is realized: arbitrariness and crime will then
   disappear forever from the face of the earth. And still others think
   more sloppily that the shilly-shallyings and the compromises have no
   importance since the future will turn out well and, in some way or
   other, will muddle along into victory. Those who project themselves
   toward a Future-Thing and submerge their freedom in it find the
   tranquillity of the serious.

   However, we have seen that, despite the requirements of his system,
   even Hegel does not dare delude himself with the idea of a stationary
   future; he admits that, mind being restlessness, the struggle will
   never cease. Marx did not consider the coming of the socialist state as
   an absolute result, but as the end of a pre-history on the basis of
   which real history begins. However, it would be sufficient, in order
   for the myth of the future to be valid, for this history to be
   conceivable as a harmonious development where reconciled men would
   fulfill themselves as a pure positivity; but this dream is not
   permitted since man is originally a negativity. No social upheaval, no
   moral conversion can eliminate this lack which is in his heart; it is
   by making himself a lack of being that man exists, and positive
   existence is this lack assumed but not eliminated; we can not establish
   upon existence an abstract wisdom which, turning itself away from
   being, would aim at only the harmony itself of the existants: for it is
   then the absolute silence of the in-itself which would close up around
   this negation of negativity; without this particular movement which
   thrusts him toward the future man would not exist. But then one can not
   imagine any reconciliation of transcendences: they do not have the
   indifferent docility of a pure abstraction; they are concrete and
   concretely compete with others for being. The world which they reveal
   is a battle-field where there is no neutral ground and which cannot be
   divided up into parcels: for each individual project is asserted
   through the world as a whole. The fundamental ambiguity of the human
   condition will always open up to men the possibility of opposing
   choices; there will always be within them the desire to be that being
   of whom they have made themselves a lack, the flight from the anguish
   of freedom; the plane of hell, of struggle, will never be eliminated;
   freedom will never be given; it will always have to be won: that is
   what Trotsky was saying when he envisaged the future as a permanent
   revolution. Thus, there is a fallacy hidden in that abuse of language
   which all parties make use of today to justify their politics when they
   declare that the world is still at war. If one means by that that the
   struggle is not over, that the world is a prey to opposed interests
   which affront each other violently, he is speaking the truth; but he
   also means that such a situation is abnormal and calls for abnormal
   behavior; the politics that it involves can impugn every moral
   principle, since it has only a provisional form: later on we shall act
   in accordance with truth and justice. To the idea of present war there
   is opposed that of a future peace when man will again find, along with
   a stable situation, the possibility of a morality. But the truth is
   that if division and violence define war, the world has always been at
   war and always will be; if man is waiting for universal peace in order
   to establish his existence validly, he will wait indefinitely: there
   will never be any other future.

   It is possible that some may challenge this assertion as being based
   upon debatable ontological presuppositions; it should at least be
   recognized that this harmonious future is only an uncertain dream and
   that in any case it is not ours. Our hold on the future is limited; the
   movement of expansion of existence requires that we strive at every
   moment to amplify it; but where it stops our future stops too; beyond,
   there is nothing more because nothing more is disclosed. From that
   formless night we can draw no justification of our acts, it condemns
   them with the same indifference; wiping out today’s errors and defeats,
   it will also wipe out its triumphs; it can be chaos or death as well as
   paradise: perhaps men will one day return to barbarism, perhaps one day
   the earth will no longer be anything but an icy planet. In this
   perspective all moments are lost in the indistinctness of nothingness
   and being. Man ought not entrust the care of his salvation to this
   uncertain and foreign future: it is up to him to assure it within his
   own existence; this existence is conceivable, as we have said, only as
   an affirmation of the future, but of a human future, a finite future.

   It is difficult today to safeguard this sense of finiteness. The Greek
   cities and the Roman republic were able to will themselves in their
   finiteness because the infinite which invested them was for them only
   darkness; they died because of this ignorance, but they also lived by
   it. Today, however, we are having a hard time living because we are so
   bent on outwitting death. We are aware that the whole world is
   interested in each of our undertakings and this spatial enlargement of
   our projects also governs their temporal dimension; by a paradoxical
   symmetry, whereas an individual accords great value to one day of his
   life, and a city to one year, the interests of the World are computed
   in centuries; the greater the human density that one envisages, the
   more the viewpoint of externality wins over that of internality, and
   the idea of externality carries with it that of quantity. Thus, the
   scales of measurement have changed; space and time have expanded about
   us: today it is a small matter that a million men and a century seem to
   us only a provisional moment; yet, the individual is not touched by
   this transformation, his life keeps the same rhythm, his death does not
   retreat before him; he extends his control of the world by instruments
   which enable him to devour distances and to multiply the output of his
   effort in time; but he is always only one. However, instead of
   accepting his limits, he tries to do away with them. He aspires to act
   upon everything and by knowing everything. Throughout the eighteenth
   and nineteenth centuries there developed the dream of a universal
   science which, manifesting the solidarity of the parts of the whole
   also admitted a universal power; it was a dream “dreamed by reason,” as
   Valery puts it, but which was none the less hollow, like all dreams.
   For a scientist who would aspire to know everything about a phenomenon
   would dissolve it within the totality; and a man who would aspire to
   act upon the totality of the Universe would see the meaning of all
   action vanish. Just as the infinity spread out before my gaze contracts
   above my head into a blue ceiling, so my transcendence heaps up in the
   distance the opaque thickness of the future; but between sky and earth
   there is a perceptional field with its forms and colors; and it is in
   the interval which separates me today from an unforeseeable future that
   there are meanings and ends toward which to direct my acts. As soon as
   one introduces the presence of the finite individual into the world, a
   presence without which there is no world, finite forms stand out
   through time and space. And in reverse, though a landscape is not only
   a transition but a particular object, an event is not only a passage
   but a particular reality. If one denies with Hegel the concrete
   thickness of the here and now in favor of universal space-time, if one
   denies the separate consciousness in favor of Mind, one misses with
   Hegel the truth of the world.

   It is no more necessary to regard History as a rational totality than
   to regard the Universe as such. Man, mankind, the universe, and history
   are, in Sartre’s expression, “detotalized totalities,” that is,
   separation does not exclude relation, nor vice-versa. Society exists
   only by means of the existence of particular individuals; likewise,
   human adventures stand out against the background of time, each finite
   to each, though they are all open to the infinity of the future and
   their individual forms thereby imply each other without destroying each
   other. A conception of this kind does not contradict that of a
   historical unintelligibility; for it is not true that the mind has to
   choose between the contingent absurdity of the discontinuous and the
   rationalistic necessity of the continuous; on the contrary, it is part
   of its function to make a multiplicity of coherent ensembles stand out
   against the unique background of the world and, inversely, to
   comprehend these ensembles in the perspective of an ideal unity of the
   world. Without raising the question of historical comprehension and
   causality it is enough to recognize the presence of intelligible
   sequences within temporal forms so that forecasts and consequently
   action may be possible. In fact, whatever may be the philosophy we
   adhere to, whether our uncertainty manifests an objective and
   fundamental contingency or whether it expresses our subjective
   ignorance in the face of a rigorous necessity, the practical attitude
   remains the same; we must decide upon the opportuneness of an act and
   attempt to measure its effectiveness without knowing all the factors
   that are present. Just as the scientist, in order to know a phenomenon,
   does not wait for the light of completed knowledge to break upon it; on
   the contrary, in illuminating the phenomenon, he helps establish the
   knowledge; in like manner, the man of action, in order to make a
   decision, will not wait for a perfect knowledge to prove to him the
   necessity of a certain choice; he must first choose and thus help
   fashion history. A choice of this kind is no more arbitrary than a
   hypothesis; it excludes neither reflection nor even method; but it is
   also free, and it implies risks that must be assumed as such. The
   movement of the mind, whether it be called thought or will, always
   starts up in the darkness. And at bottom it matters very little,
   practically speaking, whether there is a Science of history or not,
   since this Science can come to light only at the end of the future and
   since at each particular moment we must, in any case, maneuver in a
   state of doubt. The communists themselves admit that it is subjectively
   possible for them to be mistaken despite the strict dialectic of
   History. The latter is not revealed to them today in its finished form;
   they are obliged to foresee its development, and this foresight may be
   erroneous. Thus, from the political and tactical point of view there
   will be no difference between a doctrine of pure dialectical necessity
   and a doctrine which leaves room for contingency; the difference is of
   a moral order. For, in the first case one admits a retrieval of each
   moment in the future, and thus one does not aspire to justify it by
   itself; in the second case, each undertaking, involving only a finite
   future, must be lived in its finiteness and considered as an absolute
   which no unknown time will ever succeed in saving. In fact, the one who
   asserts the unity of history also recognizes that distinct ensembles
   stand out within it; and the one who emphasizes the particularity of
   these ensembles admits that they all project against a single horizon;
   just as for all there exist both individuals and a collectivity; the
   affirmation of the collectivity over against the individual is opposed,
   not on the plane of fact, but on the moral plane, to the assertion of a
   collectivity of individuals each existing for himself. The case is the
   same in what concerns time and its moments, and just as we believe that
   by denying each individual one by one, one eliminates the collectivity,
   we think that if man gives himself up to an indefinite pursuit of the
   future he will lose his existence without ever recovering it; he then
   resembles a madman who runs after his shadow. The means, it is said,
   will be justified by the end; but it is the means which define it, and
   if it is contradicted at the moment that it is set up, the whole
   enterprise sinks into absurdity. In this way the attitude of England in
   regard to Spain, Greece, and Palestine is defended with the pretext
   that she must take up position against the Russian menace in order to
   save, along with her own existence, her civilization and the values of
   democracy; but a democracy which defends itself only by acts of
   oppression equivalent to those of authoritarian regimes, is precisely
   denying all these values; whatever the virtues of a civilization may
   be, it immediately belies them if it buys them by means of injustice
   and tyranny. Inversely, if the justifying end is thrown ahead to the
   farthermost end of a mythical future, it is no longer a reflection upon
   the means; being nearer and clearer, the means itself becomes the goal
   aimed at; it blocks the horizon without, however, being deliberately
   wanted. The triumph of Russia is proposed as a means of liberating the
   international proletariat; but has it not become an absolute end for
   all Stalinists? The end justifies the means only if it remains present,
   if it is completely disclosed in the course of the present enterprise.

   And as a matter of fact, if it is true that men seek in the future a
   guarantee of their success, a negation of their failures, it is true
   that they also feel the need of denying the indefinite flight of time
   and of holding their present between their hands. Existence must be
   asserted in the present if one does not want all life to be defined as
   an escape toward nothingness. That is the reason societies institute
   festivals whose role is to stop the movement of transcendence, to set
   up the end as an end. The hours following the liberation of Paris, for
   example, were an immense collective festival exalting the happy and
   absolute end of that particular history which was precisely the
   occupation of Paris. There were at the moment worried spirits who were
   already surpassing the present toward future difficulties; they refused
   to rejoice under the pretext that new problems were going to come up
   immediately; but this ill-humor was met with only among those who had
   very slight wish to see the Germans defeated. All those who had made
   this combat their combat, even if only by the sincerity of their hopes,
   also regarded the victory as an absolute victory, whatever the future
   might be. Nobody was so naive as not to know that unhappiness would
   soon find other forms; but this particular unhappiness was wiped off
   the earth, absolutely. That is the modern meaning of the festival,
   private as well as public. Existence attempts in the festival to
   confirm itself positively as existence. That is why, as Bataille has
   shown, it is characterized by destruction; the ethics of being is the
   ethics of saving: by storing up, one aims at the stationary plenitude
   of the in-itself, existence, on the contrary, is consumption; it makes
   itself only by destroying; the festival carries out this negative
   movement in order to indicate clearly its independence in relationship
   to the thing: one eats, drinks, lights fires, breaks things, and spends
   time and money; one spends them for nothing. The spending is also a
   matter of establishing a communication of the existants, for it is by
   the movement of recognition which goes from one to the other that
   existence is confirmed; in songs, laughter, dances, eroticism, and
   drunkenness one seeks both an exaltation of the moment and a complicity
   with other men. But the tension of existence realized as a pure
   negativity can not maintain itself for long; it must be immediately
   engaged in a new undertaking, it must dash off toward the future. The
   moment of detachment, the pure affirmation of the subjective present
   are only abstractions; the joy becomes exhausted, drunkenness subsides
   into fatigue, and one finds himself with his hands empty because one
   can never possess the present: that is what gives festivals their
   pathetic and deceptive character. One of art’s roles is to fix this
   passionate assertion of existence in a more durable way: the festival
   is at the origin of the theatre, music, the dance, and poetry. In
   telling a story, in depicting it, one makes it exist in its
   particularity with its beginning and its end, its glory or its shame;
   and this is the way it actually must be lived. In the festival, in art,
   men express their need to feel that they exist absolutely. They must
   really fulfill this wish. What stops them is that as soon as they give
   the word “end” its double meaning of goal and fulfillment they clearly
   perceive this ambiguity of their condition, which is the most
   fundamental of all: that every living movement is a sliding toward
   death. But if they are willing to look it in the face they also
   discover that every movement toward death is life. In the past people
   cried out, “The king is dead, long live the king;” thus the present
   must die so that it may live; existence must not deny this death which
   it carries in its heart; it must assert itself as an absolute in its
   very finiteness; man fulfills himself within the transitory or not at
   all. He must regard his undertakings as finite and will them
   absolutely.

   It is obvious that this finiteness is not that of the pure instant; we
   have said that the future was the meaning and the substance of all
   action; the limits can not be marked out a priori; there are projects
   which define the future of a day or of an hour; and there are others
   which are inserted into structures capable of being developed through
   one, two, or several centuries, and thereby they have a concrete hold
   on one or two or several centuries. When one fights for the
   emancipation of oppressed natives, or the socialist revolution, he is
   obviously aiming at a long range goal; and he is still aiming at it
   concretely, beyond his own death, through the movement, the league, the
   institutions, or the party that he has helped set up. What we maintain
   is that one must not expect that this goal be justified as a point of
   departure of a new future; insofar as we no longer have a hold on the
   time which will flow beyond its coming, we must not expect anything of
   that time for which we have worked; other men will have to live its
   joys and sorrows. As for us, the goal must be considered as an end; we
   have to justify it on the basis of our freedom which has projected it,
   by the ensemble of the movement which ends in its fulfillment. The
   tasks we have set up for ourselves and which, though exceeding the
   limits of our lives, are ours, must find their meaning in themselves
   and not in a mythical Historical end.

   But then, if we reject the idea of a future-myth in order to retain
   only that of a living and finite future, one which delimits transitory
   forms, we have not removed the antinomy of action; the present
   sacrifices and failures no longer seem compensated for in any point of
   time. And utility can no longer be defined absolutely. Thus, are we not
   ending by condemning action as criminal and absurd though at the same
   time condemning man to action?

Ambiguity

   The notion of ambiguity must not be confused with that of absurdity. To
   declare that existence is absurd is to deny that it can ever be given a
   meaning; to say that it is ambiguous is to assert that its meaning is
   never fixed, that it must be constantly won. Absurdity challenges every
   ethics; but also the finished rationalization of the real would leave
   no room for ethics; it is because man’s condition is ambiguous that he
   seeks, through failure and outrageousness, to save his existence. Thus,
   to say that action has to be lived in its truth, that is, in the
   consciousness of the antinomies which it involves, does not mean that
   one has to renounce it. In Plutarch Lied Pierrefeu rightly says that in
   war there is no victory which can not be regarded as unsuccessful, for
   the objective which one aims at is the total annihilation of the enemy
   and this result is never attained; yet there are wars which are won and
   wars which are lost. So is it with any activity; failure and success
   are two aspects of reality which at the start are not perceptible. That
   is what makes criticism so easy and art so difficult: the critic is
   always in a good position to show the limits that every artist gives
   himself in choosing himself; painting is not given completely either in
   Giotto or Titian or Cezanne; it is sought through the centuries and is
   never finished; a painting in which all pictorial problems are resolved
   is really inconceivable; painting itself is this movement toward its
   own reality; it is not the vain displacement of a millstone turning in
   the void; it concretizes itself on each canvas as an absolute
   existence. Art and science do not establish themselves despite failure
   but through it; which does not prevent there being truths and errors,
   masterpieces and lemons, depending upon whether the discovery or the
   painting has or has not known how to win the adherence of human
   consciousnesses; this amounts to saying that failure, always
   ineluctable, is in certain cases spared and in others not.

   It is interesting to pursue this comparison; not that we are likening
   action to a work of art or a scientific theory, but because in any case
   human transcendence must cope with the same problem: it has to found
   itself, though it is prohibited from ever fulfilling itself. Now, we
   know that neither science nor art ever leaves it up to the future to
   justify its present existence. In no age does art consider itself as
   something which is paving the way for Art: so-called archaic art
   prepares for classicism only in the eyes of archaeologists; the
   sculptor who fashioned the Korai of Athens rightfully thought that he
   was producing a finished work of art; in no age has science considered
   itself as partial and lacunary; without believing itself to be
   definitive, it has however, always wanted to be a total expression of
   the world, and it is in its totality that in each age it again raises
   the question of its own validity. There we have an example of how man
   must, in any event, assume his finiteness: not by treating his
   existence as transitory or relative but by reflecting the infinite
   within it, that is, by treating it as absolute. There is an art only
   because at every moment art has willed itself absolutely; likewise
   there is a liberation of man only if, in aiming at itself, freedom is
   achieved absolutely in the very fact of aiming at itself. This requires
   that each action be considered as a finished form whose different
   moments, instead of fleeing toward the future in order to find there
   their justification, reflect and confirm one another so well that there
   is no longer a sharp separation between present and future, between
   means and ends.

   But if these moments constitute a unity, there must be no contradiction
   among them. Since the liberation aimed at is not a thing situated in an
   unfamiliar time, but a movement which realizes itself by tending to
   conquer, it can not attain itself if it denies itself at the start;
   action can not seek to fulfill itself by means which would destroy its
   very meaning. So much so that in certain situations there will be no
   other issue for man than rejection. In what is called political realism
   there is no room for rejection because the present is considered as
   transitory; there is rejection only if man lays claim in the present to
   his existence as an absolute value; then he must absolutely reject what
   would deny this value. Today, more or less consciously in the name of
   such an ethics, we condemn a magistrate who handed over a communist to
   save ten hostages and along with him all the Vichyites who were trying
   “to make the best of things:” it was not a matter of rationalizing the
   present such as it was imposed by the German occupation, but of
   rejecting it unconditionally. The resistance did not aspire to a
   positive effectiveness; it was a negation, a revolt, a martyrdom; and
   in this negative movement freedom was positively and absolutely
   confirmed.

   In one sense the negative attitude is easy; the rejected object is
   given unequivocally and unequivocally defines the revolt that one
   opposes to it; thus, all French antifascists were united during the
   occupation by their common resistance to a single oppressor. The return
   to the positive encounters many more obstacles, as we have well seen in
   France where divisions and hatreds were revived at the same time as
   were the parties. In the moment of rejection, the antinomy of action is
   removed, and means and end meet; freedom immediately sets itself up as
   its own goal and fulfills itself by so doing. But the antinomy
   reappears as soon as freedom again gives itself ends which are far off
   in the future; then, through the resistances of the given, divergent
   means offer themselves and certain ones come to be seen as contrary to
   their ends. It has often been observed that revolt alone is pure. Every
   construction implies the outrage of dictatorship, of violence. This is
   the theme, among others, of Koestler’s Gladiators. Those who, like this
   symbolic Spartacus, do not want to retreat from the outrage and resign
   themselves to impotence, usually seek refuge in the values of
   seriousness. That is why, among individuals as well as collectivities,
   the negative moment is often the most genuine. Goethe, Barres, and
   Aragon, disdainful or rebellious in their romantic youth, shattered old
   conformisms and thereby proposed a real, though incomplete, liberation.
   But what happened later on? Goethe became a servant of the state,
   Barres of nationalism, and Aragon of Stalinist conformism. We know how
   the seriousness of the Catholic Church was substituted for the
   Christian spirit, which was a rejection of dead Law, a subjective
   rapport of the individual with God through faith and charity; the
   Reformation was a revolt of subjectivity, but Protestantism in turn
   changed into an objective moralism in which the seriousness of works
   replaced the restlessness of faith. As for revolutionary humanism, it
   accepts only rarely the tension of permanent liberation; it has created
   a Church where salvation is bought by membership in a party as it is
   bought elsewhere by baptism and indulgences. We have seen that this
   recourse to the serious is a lie; it entails the sacrifice of man to
   the Thing, of freedom to the Cause. In order for the return to the
   positive to be genuine it must involve negativity, it must not conceal
   the antinomies between means and end, present and future; they must be
   lived in a permanent tension; one must retreat from neither the outrage
   of violence nor deny it, or, which amounts to the same thing, assume it
   lightly. Kierkegaard has said that what distinguishes the pharisee from
   the genuinely moral man is that the former considers his anguish as a
   sure sign of his virtue; from the fact that he asks himself, “Am I
   Abraham?” he concludes, “I am Abraham;” but morality resides in the
   painfulness of an indefinite questioning. The problem which we are
   posing is not the same as that of Kierkegaard; the important thing to
   us is to know whether, in given conditions, Isaac must be killed or
   not. But we also think that what distinguishes the tyrant from the man
   of good will is that the first rests in the certainty of his aims,
   whereas the second keeps asking himself, “Am I really working for the
   liberation of men? Isn’t this end contested by the sacrifices through
   which I aim at it?” In setting up its ends, freedom must put them in
   parentheses, confront them at each moment with that absolute end which
   it itself constitutes, and contest, in its own name, the means it uses
   to win itself.

   It will be said that these considerations remain quite abstract. What
   must be done, practically? Which action is good? Which is bad? To ask
   such a question is also to fall into a naive abstraction. We don’t ask
   the physicist, “Which hypotheses are true?” Nor the artist, “By what
   procedures does one produce a work whose beauty is guaranteed?” Ethics
   does not furnish recipes any more than do science and art. One can
   merely propose methods. Thus, in science the fundamental problem is to
   make the idea adequate to its content and the law adequate to the
   facts; the logician finds that in the case where the pressure of the
   given fact bursts the concept which serves to comprehend it, one is
   obliged to invent another concept; but he can not define a priori the
   moment of invention, still less foresee it. Analogously, one may say
   that in the case where the content of the action falsifies its meaning,
   one must modify not the meaning, which is here willed absolutely, but
   the content itself; however, it is impossible to determine this
   relationship between meaning and content abstractly and universally:
   there must be a trial and decision in each case. But likewise just as
   the physicist finds it profitable to reflect on the conditions of
   scientific invention and the artist on those of artistic creation
   without expecting any ready-made solutions to come from these
   reflections, it is useful for the man of action to find out under what
   conditions his undertakings are valid. We are going to see that on this
   basis new perspectives are disclosed.

   In the first place, it seems to us that the individual as such is one
   of the ends at which our action must aim. Here we are at one with the
   point of view of Christian charity, the Epicurean cult of friendship,
   and Kantian moralism which treats each man as an end. He interests us
   not merely as a member of a class, a nation, or a collectivity, but as
   an individual man. This distinguishes us from the systematic politician
   who cares only about collective destinies; and probably a tramp
   enjoying his bottle of wine, or a child playing with a balloon, or a
   Neapolitan lazzarone loafing in the sun in no way helps in the
   liberation of man; that is why the abstract will of the revolutionary
   scorns the concrete benevolence which occupies itself in satisfying
   desires which have no morrow. However, it must not be forgotten that
   there is a concrete bond between freedom and existence; to will man
   free is to will there to be being, it is to will the disclosure of
   being in the joy of existence; in order for the idea of liberation to
   have a concrete meaning, the joy of existence must be asserted in each
   one, at every instant; the movement toward freedom assumes its real,
   flesh and blood figure in the world by thickening into pleasure, into
   happiness. If the satisfaction of an old man drinking a glass of wine
   counts for nothing, then production and wealth are only hollow myths;
   they have meaning only if they are capable of being retrieved in
   individual and living joy. The saving of time and the conquest of
   leisure have no meaning if we are not moved by the laugh of a child at
   play. If we do not love life on our own account and through others, it
   is futile to seek to justify it in any way.

   However, politics is right in rejecting benevolence to the extent that
   the latter thoughtlessly sacrifices the future to the present. The
   ambiguity of freedom, which very often is occupied only in fleeing from
   itself, introduces a difficult equivocation into relationships with
   each individual taken one by one. Just what is meant by the expression
   “to love others”? What is meant by taking them as ends? In any event,
   it is evident that we are not going to decide to fulfill the will of
   every man. There are cases where a man positively wants evil, that is,
   the enslavement of other men, and he must then be fought. It also
   happens that, without harming anyone, he flees from his own freedom,
   seeking passionately and alone to attain the being which constantly
   eludes him. If he asks for our help, are we to give it to him? We blame
   a man who helps a drug addict intoxicate himself or a desperate man
   commit suicide, for we think that rash behavior of this sort is an
   attempt of the individual against his own freedom; he must be made
   aware of his error and put in the presence of the real demands of his
   freedom. Well and good. But what if he persists? Must we then use
   violence? There again the serious man busies himself dodging the
   problem; the values of life, of health, and of moral conformism being
   set up, one does not hesitate to impose them on others. But we know
   that this pharisaism can cause the worst disasters: lacking drugs, the
   addict may kill himself. It is no more necessary to serve an abstract
   ethics obstinately than to yield without due consideration to impulses
   of pity or generosity; violence is justified only if it opens concrete
   possibilities to the freedom which I am trying to save; by practicing
   it I am willy-nilly assuming an engagement in relation to others and to
   myself; a man whom I snatch from the death which he had chosen has the
   right to come and ask me for means and reasons for living; the tyranny
   practiced against an invalid can be justified only by his getting
   better; whatever the purity of the intention which animates me, any
   dictatorship is a fault for which I have to get myself pardoned.
   Besides, I am in no position to make decisions of this sort
   indiscriminately; the example of the unknown person who throws himself
   in to the Seine and whom I hesitate whether or not to fish out is quite
   abstract; in the absence of a concrete bond with this desperate person
   my choice will never be anything but a contingent facticity. If I find
   myself in a position to do violence to a child, or to a melancholic,
   sick, or distraught person the reason is that I also find myself
   charged with his upbringing, his happiness, and his health: I am a
   parent, a teacher, a nurse, a doctor, or a friend... So, by a tacit
   agreement, by the very fact that I am solicited, the strictness of my
   decision is accepted or even desired; the more seriously I accept my
   responsibilities, the more justified it is. That is why love authorizes
   severities which are not granted to indifference. What makes the
   problem so complex is that, on the one hand, one must not make himself
   an accomplice of that flight from freedom that is found in
   heedlessness, caprice, mania, and passion, and that, on the other hand,
   it is the abortive movement of man toward being which is his very
   existence, it is through the failure which he has assumed that he
   asserts himself as a freedom. To want to prohibit a man from error is
   to forbid him to fulfill his own existence, it is to deprive him of
   life. At the beginning of Claudel’s The Satin Shoe, the husband of Dona
   Prouheze, the judge, the just, as the author regards him, explains that
   every plant needs a gardener in order to grow and that he is the one
   whom heaven has destined for his young wife; beside the fact that we
   are shocked by the arrogance of such a thought (for how does he know
   that he is this enlightened gardener? Isn’t he merely a jealous
   husband?) this likening of a soul to a plant is not acceptable; for, as
   Kant would say, the value of an act lies not in its conformity to an
   external model, but in its internal truth. We object to the inquisitors
   who want to create faith and virtue from without; we object to all
   forms of fascism which seek to fashion the happiness of man from
   without; and also the paternalism which thinks that it has done
   something for man by prohibiting him from certain possibilities of
   temptation, whereas what is necessary is to give him reasons for
   resisting it.

   Thus, violence is not immediately justified when it opposes willful
   acts which one considers perverted; it becomes inadmissible if it uses
   the pretext of ignorance to deny a freedom which, as we have seen, can
   be practiced within ignorance itself. Let the “enlightened elites”
   strive to change the situation of the child, the illiterate, the
   primitive crushed beneath his superstitions; that is one of their most
   urgent tasks; but in this very effort they must respect a freedom
   which, like theirs, is absolute. They are always opposed, for example,
   to the extension of universal suffrage by adducing the incompetence of
   the masses, of women, of the natives in the colonies; but this
   forgetting that man always has to decide by himself in the darkness,
   that he must want beyond what he knows. If infinite knowledge were
   necessary (even supposing that it were conceivable), then the colonial
   administrator himself would not have the right to freedom; he is much
   further from perfect knowledge than the most backward savage is from
   him. Actually, to vote is not to govern; and to govern is not merely to
   maneuver; there is an ambiguity today, and particularly in France,
   because we think that we are not the master of our destiny; we no
   longer hope to help make history, we are resigned to submitting to it;
   all that our internal politics does is reflect the play of external
   forces, no party hopes to determine the fate of the country but merely
   to foresee the future which is being prepared in the world by foreign
   powers and to use, as best we can, the bit of indetermination which
   still escapes their foresight. Drawn along by this tactical realism,
   the citizens themselves no longer consider the vote as the assertion of
   their will but as a maneuver, whether one adheres completely to the
   maneuvering of a party or whether one invents his own strategy; the
   electors consider themselves not as men who are consulted about a
   particular point but as forces which are numbered and which are ordered
   about with a view to distant ends. And that is probably why the French,
   who formerly were so eager to declare their opinions, take no further
   interest in an act which has become a disheartening strategy. So, the
   fact is that if it is necessary not to vote but to measure the weight
   of one’s vote, this calculation requires such extensive information and
   such a sureness of foresight that only a specialized technician can
   have the boldness to express an opinion. But that is one of the abuses
   whereby the whole meaning of democracy is lost; the logical conclusion
   of this would be to suppress the vote. The vote should really be the
   expression of a concrete will, the choice of a representative capable
   of defending, within the general framework of the country and the
   world, the particular interests of his electors. The ignorant and the
   outcast also has interests to defend; he alone is “competent” to decide
   upon his hopes and his trust. By a sophism which leans upon the
   dishonesty of the serious, one does not merely argue about his formal
   impotence to choose, but one draws arguments from the content of his
   choice. I recall, among others, the naivete of a right-thinking young
   girl who said, “The vote for women is all well and good in principle,
   only, if women get the vote, they’ll all vote red.” With like impudence
   it is almost unanimously stated today in France that if the natives of
   the French Union were given the rights of self-determination, they
   would live quietly in their villages without doing anything, which
   would be harmful to the higher interests of the Economy. And doubtless
   the state of stagnation in which they choose to live is not that which
   a man can wish for another man; it is desirable to open new
   possibilities to the indolent negroes so that the interests of the
   Economy may one day merge with theirs. But for the time being, they are
   left to vegetate in the sort of situation where their freedom can
   merely be negative – the best thing they can desire is not to tire
   themselves, not to suffer, and not to work; and even this freedom is
   denied them. It is the most consummate and inacceptable form of
   oppression.

   However, the “enlightened elite” objects, one does not let a child
   dispose of himself, one does not permit him to vote. This is another
   sophism. To the extent that woman or the happy or resigned slave lives
   in the infantile world of ready-made values, calling them “an eternal
   child” or a “grown-up child” has some meaning, but the analogy is only
   partial. Childhood is a particular sort of situation: it is a natural
   situation whose limits are not created by other men and which is
   thereby not comparable to a situation of oppression; it is a situation
   which is common to all men and which is temporary for all; therefore,
   it does not represent a limit which cuts off the individual from his
   possibilities, but, on the contrary, the moment of a development in
   which new possibilities are won. The child is ignorant because he has
   not yet had the time to acquire knowledge, not because this time has
   been refused him. To treat him as a child is not to bar him from the
   future but to open it to him; he needs to be taken in hand, he invites
   authority, it is the form which the resistance of facticity, through
   which all liberation is brought about, takes for him. And on the other
   hand, even in this situation the child has a right to his freedom and
   must be respected as a human person. What gives Emile its value is the
   brilliance with which Rousseau asserts this principle. There is a very
   annoying naturalistic optimism in Emile; in the rearing of the child,
   as in any relationship with others, the ambiguity of freedom implies
   the outrage of violence; in a sense, all education is a failure. But
   Rousseau is right in refusing to allow childhood to be oppressed. And
   in practice raising a child as one cultivates a plant which one does
   not consult about its needs is very different from considering it as a
   freedom to whom the future must be opened.

   Thus, we can set up point number one: the good of an individual or a
   group of individuals requires that it be taken as an absolute end of
   our action; but we are not authorized to decide upon this end a priori.
   The fact is that no behavior is ever authorized to begin with, and one
   of the concrete consequences of existentialist ethics is the rejection
   of all the previous justifications which might be drawn from the
   civilization, the age, and the culture; it is the rejection of every
   principle of authority. To put it positively, the precept will be to
   treat the other (to the extent that he is the only one concerned, which
   is the moment that we are considering at present) as a freedom so that
   his end may be freedom; in using this conducting wire one will have to
   incur the risk, in each case, of inventing an original solution. Out of
   disappointment in love a young girl takes an overdose of
   phenol-barbital; in the morning friends find her dying, they call a
   doctor, she is saved; later on she becomes a happy mother of a family;
   her friends were right in considering her suicide as a hasty and
   heedless act and in putting her into a position to reject it or return
   to it freely. But in asylums one sees melancholic patients who have
   tried to commit suicide twenty times, who devote their freedom to
   seeking the means of escaping their jailers and of putting an end to
   their intolerable anguish; the doctor who gives them a friendly pat on
   the shoulder is their tyrant and their torturer. A friend who is
   intoxicated by alcohol or drugs asks me for money so that he can go and
   buy the poison that is necessary to him; I urge him to get cured, I
   take him to a doctor, I try to help him live; insofar as there is a
   chance of my being successful, I am acting correctly in refusing him
   the sum he asks for. But if circumstances prohibit me from doing
   anything to change the situation in which he is struggling, all I can
   do is give in; a deprivation of a few hours will do nothing but
   exasperate his torments uselessly; and he may have recourse to extreme
   means to get what I do not give him. That is also the problem touched
   on by Ibsen in The Wild Duck. An individual lives in a situation of
   falsehood; the falsehood is violence, tyranny: shall I tell the truth
   in order to free the victim? It would first be necessary to create a
   situation of such a kind that the truth might be bearable and that,
   though losing his illusions, the deluded individual might again find
   about him reasons for hoping. What makes the problem more complex is
   that the freedom of one man almost always concerns that of other
   individuals. Here is a married couple who persist in living in a hovel;
   if one does not succeed in giving them the desire to live in a more
   healthful dwelling, they must be allowed to follow their preferences;
   but the situation changes if they have children; the freedom of the
   parents would be the ruin of their sons, and as freedom and the future
   are on the side of the latter, these are the ones who must first be
   taken into account. The Other is multiple, and on the basis of this new
   questions arise.

   One might first wonder for whom we are seeking freedom and happiness.
   When raised in this way, the problem is abstract; the answer will,
   therefore, be arbitrary, and the arbitrary always involves outrage. It
   is not entirely the fault of the district social-worker if she is apt
   to be odious; because, her money and time being limited, she hesitates
   before distributing it to this one or that one, she appears to others
   as a pure externality, a blind facticity. Contrary to the formal
   strictness of Kantianism for whom the more abstract the act is the more
   virtuous it is, generosity seems to us to be better grounded and
   therefore more valid the less distinction there is between the other
   and ourself and the more we fulfill ourself in taking the other as an
   end. That is what happens if I am engaged in relation to others. The
   Stoics impugned the ties of family, friendship, and nationality so that
   they recognized only the universal form of man. But man is man only
   through situations whose particularity is precisely a universal fact.
   There are men who expect help from certain men and not from others, and
   these expectations define privileged lines of action. It is fitting
   that the negro fight for the negro, the Jew for the Jew, the
   proletarian for the proletarian, and the Spaniard in Spain. But the
   assertion of these particular solidarities must not contradict the will
   for universal solidarity and each finite undertaking must also be open
   on the totality of men.

   But it is then that we find in concrete form the conflicts which we
   have described abstractly; for the cause of freedom can triumph only
   through particular sacrifices. And certainly there are hierarchies
   among the goods desired by men: one will not hesitate to sacrifice the
   comfort, luxury, and leisure of certain men to assure the liberation of
   certain others; but when it is a question of choosing among freedoms,
   how shall we decide?

   Let us repeat, one can only indicate a method here. The first point is
   always to consider what genuine human interest fills the abstract form
   which one proposes as the action’s end. Politics always puts forward
   Ideas: Nation, Empire, Union, Economy, etc. But none of these forms has
   value in itself; it has it only insofar as it involves concrete
   individuals. If a nation can assert itself proudly only to the
   detriment of its members, if a union can be created only to the
   detriment of those it is trying to unite, the nation or the union must
   be rejected. We repudiate all idealisms, mysticisms, etcetera which
   prefer a Form to man himself. But the matter becomes really agonizing
   when it is a question of a Cause which genuinely serves man. That is
   why the question of Stalinist politics, the problem of the relationship
   of the Party to the masses which it uses in order to serve them, is in
   the forefront of the preoccupations of all men of good will. However,
   there are very few who raise it without dishonesty, and we must first
   try to dispel a few fallacies.

   The opponent of the U.S.S.R. is making use of a fallacy when,
   emphasizing the part of criminal violence assumed by Stalinist
   politics, he neglects to confront it with the ends pursued. Doubtless,
   the purges, the deportations, the abuses of the occupation, and the
   police dictatorship surpass in importance the violences practiced by
   any other country; the very fact that there are a hundred and sixty
   million inhabitants in Russia multiplies the numerical coefficient of
   the injustices committed. But these quantitative considerations are
   insufficient. One can no more judge the means without the end which
   gives it its meaning than he can detach the end from the means which
   defines it. Lynching a negro or suppressing a hundred members of the
   opposition are two analogous acts. Lynching is an absolute evil; it
   represents the survival of an obsolete civilization, the perpetuation
   of a struggle of races which has to disappear; it is a fault without
   justification or excuse. Suppressing a hundred opponents is surely an
   outrage, but it may have meaning and a reason; it is a matter of
   maintaining a regime which brings to an immense mass of men a bettering
   of their lot. Perhaps this measure could have been avoided; perhaps it
   merely represents that necessary element of failure which is involved
   in any positive construction. It can be judged only by being replaced
   in the ensemble of the cause it serves.

   But, on the other hand, the defender of the U.S.S.R. is making use of a
   fallacy when he unconditionally justifies the sacrifices and the crimes
   by the ends pursued; it would first be necessary to prove that, on the
   one hand, the end is unconditioned and that, on the other hand, the
   crimes committed in its name were strictly necessary. Against the death
   of Bukharin one counters with Stalingrad; but one would have to know to
   what effective extent the Moscow trials increased the chances of the
   Russian victory. One of the ruses of Stalinist orthodoxy is, playing on
   the idea of necessity, to put the whole of the revolution on one side
   of the scale; the other side will always seem very light. But the very
   idea of a total dialectic of history does not imply that any factor is
   ever determining; on the contrary, if one admits that the life of a man
   may change the course of events, it is that one adheres to the
   conception which grants a preponderant role to Cleopatra’s nose and
   Cromwell’s wart. One is here playing, with utter dishonesty, on two
   opposite conceptions of the idea of necessity: one synthetic, and the
   other analytic; one dialectic, the other deterministic. The first makes
   History appear as an intelligible becoming within which the
   particularity of contingent accidents is reabsorbed; the dialectical
   sequence of the moments is possible only if there is within each moment
   an indetermination of the particular elements taken one by one. If, on
   the contrary, one grants the strict determinism of each causal series,
   one ends in a contingent and disordered vision of the ensemble, the
   conjunction of the series being brought about by chance. Therefore, a
   Marxist must recognize that none of his particular decisions involves
   the revolution in its totality; it is merely a matter of hastening or
   retarding its coming, of saving himself the use of other and more
   costly means. That does not mean that he must retreat from violence but
   that he must not regard it as justified a priori by its ends. If he
   considers his enterprise in its truth, that is, in its finiteness, he
   will understand that he has never anything but a finite stake to oppose
   to the sacrifices which he calls for, and that it is an uncertain
   stake. Of course, this uncertainty should not keep him from pursuing
   his goals; but it requires that one concern himself in each case with
   finding a balance between the goal and its means.

   Thus, we challenge every condemnation as well as every a priori
   justification of the violence practiced with a view to a valid end.
   They must be legitimized concretely. A calm, mathematical calculation
   is here impossible. One must attempt to judge the chances of success
   that are involved in a certain sacrifice; but at the beginning this
   judgment will always be doubtful; besides, in the face of the immediate
   reality of the sacrifice, the notion of chance is difficult to think
   about. On the one hand, one can multiply a probability infinitely
   without ever reaching certainty; but yet, practically, it ends by
   merging with this asymptote: in our private life as in our collective
   life there is no other truth than a statistical one. On the other hand,
   the interests at stake do not allow themselves to be put into an
   equation; the suffering of one man, that of a million men, are
   incommensurable with the conquests realized by millions of others,
   present death is incommensurable with the life to come. It would be
   utopian to want to set up on the one hand the chances of success
   multiplied by the stake one is after, and on the other hand the weight
   of the immediate sacrifice. One finds himself back at the anguish of
   free decision. And that is why political choice is an ethical choice:
   it is a wager as well as a decision; one bets on the chances and risks
   of the measure under consideration; but whether chances and risks must
   be assumed or not in the given circumstances must be decided without
   help, and in so doing one sets up values. If in 1793 the Girondists
   rejected the violences of the Terror whereas a Saint-Just and a
   Robespierre assumed them, the reason is that they did not have the same
   conception of freedom. Nor was the same republic being aimed at between
   1830 and 1840 by the republicans who limited themselves to a purely
   political opposition and those who adopted the technique of
   insurrection. In each case it is a matter of defining an end and
   realizing it, knowing that the choice of the means employed affects
   both the definition and the fulfillment.

   Ordinarily, situations are so complex that a long analysis is necessary
   before being able to pose the ethical moment of the choice. We shall
   confine ourselves here to the consideration of a few simple examples
   which will enable us to make our attitude somewhat more precise. In an
   underground revolutionary movement when one discovers the presence of a
   stool-pigeon, one does not hesitate to beat him up; he is a present and
   future danger who has to be gotten rid of; but if a man is merely
   suspected of treason, the case is more ambiguous. We blame those
   northern peasants who in the war of 1914-18 massacred an innocent
   family which was suspected of signaling to the enemy; the reason is
   that not only were the presumptions vague, but the danger was
   uncertain; at any rate, it was enough to put the suspects into prison;
   while waiting for a serious inquiry it was easy to keep them from doing
   any harm. However, if a questionable individual holds the fate of other
   men in his hands, if, in order to avoid the risk of killing one
   innocent man, one runs the risk of letting ten innocent men die, it is
   reasonable to sacrifice him. We can merely ask that such decisions be
   not taken hastily and lightly, and that, all things considered, the
   evil that one inflicts be lesser than that which is being forestalled.

   There are cases still more disturbing because there the violence is not
   immediately efficacious; the violences of the Resistance did not aim at
   the material weakening of Germany; it happens that their purpose was to
   create such a state of violence that collaboration would be impossible;
   in one sense, the burning of a whole French village was too high a
   price to pay for the elimination of three enemy officers; but those
   fires and the massacring of hostages were themselves parts of the plan;
   they created an abyss between the occupiers and the occupied. Likewise,
   the insurrections in Paris and Lyons at the beginning of the nineteenth
   century, or the revolts in India, did not aim at shattering the yoke of
   the oppressor at one blow, but rather at creating and keeping alive the
   meaning of the revolt and at making the mystifications of conciliation
   impossible. Attempts which are aware that one by one they are doomed to
   failure can be legitimized by the whole of the situation which they
   create. This is also the meaning of Steinbeck’s novel In Dubious Battle
   where a communist leader does not hesitate to launch a costly strike of
   uncertain success but through which there will be born, along with the
   solidarity of the workers, the consciousness of exploitation and the
   will to reject it.

   It seems to me interesting to contrast this example with the debate in
   John Dos Passos’ The Adventures of a Young Man. Following a strike,
   some American miners are condemned to death. Their comrades try to have
   their trial reconsidered. Two methods are put forward: one can act
   officially, and one knows that they then have an excellent chance of
   winning their case; one can also work up a sensational trial with the
   Communist Party taking the affair in hand, stirring up a press campaign
   and circulating international petitions; but the court will be
   unwilling to yield to this intimidation. The party will thereby get a
   tremendous amount of publicity, but the miners will be condemned. What
   is a man of good will to decide in this case? Dos Passos’ hero chooses
   to save the miners and we believe that he did right. Certainly, if it
   were necessary to choose between the whole revolution and the lives of
   two or three men, no revolutionary would hesitate; but it was merely a
   matter of helping along the party propaganda, or better, of increasing
   somewhat its chances of developing within the United States; the
   immediate interest of the C.P. in that country is only hypothetically
   tied up with that of the revolution; in fact, a cataclysm like the war
   has so upset the situation of the world that a great part of the gains
   and losses of the past have been absolutely swept away. If it is really
   men which the movement claims to be serving, in this case it must
   prefer saving the lives of three concrete individuals to a very
   uncertain and weak chance of serving a little more effectively by their
   sacrifice the mankind to come. If it considers these lives negligible,
   it is because it too ranges itself on the side of the formal
   politicians who prefer the Idea to its content; it is because it
   prefers itself, in its subjectivity, to the goals to which it claims to
   be dedicated. Besides, whereas in the example chosen by Steinbeck the
   strike is immediately an appeal to the freedom of the workers and in
   its very failure is already a liberation, the sacrifice of the miners
   is a mystification and an oppression; they are duped by being made to
   believe that an effort is being made to save their lives, and the whole
   proletariat is duped with them. Thus, in both examples, we find
   ourselves before the same abstract case: men are going to die so that
   the party which claims to be serving them will realize a limited gain;
   but a concrete analysis leads us to opposite moral solutions.

   It is apparent that the method we are proposing, analogous in this
   respect to scientific or aesthetic methods, consists, in each case, of
   confronting the values realized with the values aimed at, and the
   meaning of the act with its content. The fact is that the politician,
   contrary to the scientist and the artist, and although the element of
   failure which he assumes is much more outrageous, is rarely concerned
   with making use of it. May it be that there is an irresistible
   dialectic of power wherein morality has no place? Is the ethical
   concern, even in its realistic and concrete form, detrimental to the
   interests of action? The objection will surely be made that hesitation
   and misgivings only impede victory. Since, in any case, there is an
   element of failure in all success, since the ambiguity, at any rate,
   must be surmounted, why not refuse to take notice of it? In the first
   number of the Cahiers d’Action a reader declared that once and for all
   we should regard the militant communist as “the permanent hero of our
   time” and should reject the exhausting tension demanded by
   existentialism; installed in the permanence of heroism, he will blindly
   direct himself toward an uncontested goal; but one then resembles
   Colonel de la Roque who unwaveringly went right straight ahead of him
   without knowing where he was going. Malaparte relates that the young
   Nazis, in order to become insensitive to the suffering of others,
   practiced by plucking out the eyes of live cats; there is no more
   radical way of avoiding the pitfalls of ambiguity. But an action which
   wants to serve man ought to be careful not to forget him on the way; if
   it chooses to fulfill itself blindly, it will lose its meaning or will
   take on an unforeseen meaning; for the goal is not fixed once and for
   all; it is defined all along the road which leads to it. Vigilance
   alone can keep alive the validity of the goals and the genuine
   assertion of freedom. Moreover, ambiguity can not fail to appear on the
   scene; it is felt by the victim, and his revolt or his complaints also
   make it exist for his tyrant; the latter will then be tempted to put
   everything into question, to renounce, thus denying both himself and
   his ends; or, if he persists, he will continue to blind himself only by
   multiplying crimes and by perverting his original design more and more.
   The fact is that the man of action becomes a dictator not in respect to
   his ends but because these ends are necessarily set up through his
   will. Hegel, in his Phenomenology, has emphasized this inextricable
   confusion between objectivity and subjectivity. A man gives himself to
   a Cause only by making it his Cause; as he fulfills himself within it,
   it is also through him that it is expressed, and the will to power is
   not distinguished in such a case from generosity; when an individual or
   a party chooses to triumph, whatever the cost may be, it is their own
   triumph which they take for an end. If the fusion of the Commissar and
   the Yogi were realized, there would be a self-criticism in the man of
   action which would expose to him the ambiguity of his will, thus
   arresting the imperious drive of his subjectivity and, by the same
   token, contesting the unconditioned value of the goal. But the fact is
   that the politician follows the line of least resistance; it is easy to
   fall asleep over the unhappiness of others and to count it for very
   little; it is easier to throw a hundred men, ninety-seven of whom are
   innocent, into prison, than to discover the three culprits who are
   hidden among them; it is easier to kill a man than to keep a close
   watch on him; all politics makes use of the police, which officially
   flaunts its radical contempt for the individual and which loves
   violence for its own sake. The thing that goes by the name of political
   necessity is in part the laziness and brutality of the police. That is
   why it is incumbent upon ethics not to follow the line of least
   resistance; an act which is not destined, but rather quite freely
   consented to; it must make itself effective so that what was at first
   facility may become difficult. For want of internal criticism, this is
   the role that an opposition must take upon itself. There are two types
   of opposition. The first is a rejection of the very ends set up by a
   regime: it is the opposition of anti-fascism to fascism, of fascism to
   socialism. In the second type, the oppositionist accepts the objective
   goal but criticizes the subjective movement which aims at it; he may
   not even wish for a change of power, but he deems it necessary to bring
   into play a contestation which will make the subjective appear as such.
   Thereby he exacts a perpetual contestation of the means by the end and
   of the end by the means. He must be careful himself not to ruin, by the
   means which he employs, the end he is aiming at, and above all not to
   pass into the service of the oppositionists of the first type. But,
   delicate as it may be, his role is, nevertheless, necessary. Indeed, on
   the one hand, it would be absurd to oppose a liberating action with the
   pretext that it implies crime and tyranny; for without crime and
   tyranny there could be no liberation of man; one can not escape that
   dialectic which goes from freedom to freedom through dictatorship and
   oppression. But, on the other hand, he would be guilty of allowing the
   liberating movement to harden into a moment which is acceptable only if
   it passes into its opposite; tyranny and crime must be kept from
   triumphantly establishing themselves in the world; the conquest of
   freedom is their only justification, and the assertion of freedom
   against them must therefore be kept alive.
