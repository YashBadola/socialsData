Preface

Not merely in the marketplace of coins, but in the marketplace of thoughts, our age is holding a clearance sale. Everything is to be had at such a bargain that it is questionable whether in the end there is anyone who will want to bid. Every speculative clerk who signals the significant trends in the credit market writes manuals, prospectuses, and promises; and he, being a man of honor, surely believes that he is the one to pay the bond.

The Knight of Faith

If I were able to make myself understood to anyone, I would not need to use the following example, but since I cannot, I will try to make myself understood through it.

A young man falls in love with a princess, and the whole content of his life consists in this love, and yet the situation is such that it is impossible for it to be realized, impossible for it to be translated from ideality into reality. The slaves of the trivial, the frogs in life’s swamp, will naturally croak, "Such a love is foolishness. The rich brewer’s widow is a match just as good and solid." Let them croak in the swamp undisturbed. It is not so with the knight of infinite resignation. He does not give up the love, not for all the glory of the world. He is no fool. First he makes sure that this really is the content of his life, and his soul is too healthy and too proud to waste the least thing on a mere intoxication. He is not cowardly; he is not afraid of letting love creep into his most secret thoughts, into his most hidden corners, to let it wind itself in innumerable coils about every fiber of his consciousness—if the love becomes an unhappy love, he will never be able to tear himself loose from it. He feels a blissful rapture in letting love palpitate in every nerve, and yet his soul is solemn as the one who has drained the cup of poison and feels the coldness merge with the blood—for the moment, the moment of resignation, is fast approaching.

He keeps the love young, and with it he grows old.

...

Faith is precisely this paradox, that the single individual is higher than the universal. It is a movement by virtue of the absurd.
