The man who seeks to justify his life must want freedom itself absolutely and above everything else. At the same time that it requires the realization of concrete ends, of particular projects, it requires itself universally. It is not a ready-made value which offers itself from the outside to my abstract adherence, but it appears (not on the plane of facility, but on the moral plane) as a cause of itself. It is necessarily summoned up by the values which it sets up and through which it sets itself up. It can not establish a denial of itself, for in denying itself, it would deny the possibility of any foundation. To will oneself moral and to will oneself free are one and the same decision.

The meanness of the serious man can be explained by the fact that the freedom which he has resigned is no longer present in his universe to make him responsible for his crimes; his acts are not his, they are the automatic consequences of a given regime, of a given situation, which he serves but which he does not control. He is a tyrant, but he is a tyrant "in spite of himself." He is a "dutiful" executioner. He is a "conscientious" bureaucrat. He is a "faithful" soldier. He washes his hands of the blood that stains them.

But if man is free to define himself, he is not free to avoid the presence of the other. The other is the indissoluble bond between the individual and the world. My freedom, in order to fulfill itself, requires that it emerge into an open future: it is other men who open the future to me, it is they who, setting up the world of tomorrow, define my future; but if, instead of allowing me to participate in this constructive movement, they oblige me to consume my transcendence in vain, they are denying me my freedom. This is why there is no salvation for the individual by himself: one can be saved only by saving the world.

To will oneself free is also to will others free. This will is not an abstract formula. It points out to each person the concrete action to be achieved. But the others are separate, even opposed, and the man of good will sees himself forced to choose between them. It is here that the failure of the "serious" man becomes evident: he chooses the cause of the abstract against the concrete, the cause of the State against the citizens, the cause of the Party against the workers. He sacrifices the present to the future, the individual to the Universal.

Authentic morality, on the contrary, knows that it takes place in a world of ambiguity. It knows that every action involves a failure, that there is no absolute success. But it does not resign itself to this failure; it assumes it. It is in the tension of the failure and the success, of the singular and the universal, that human freedom is played out.
