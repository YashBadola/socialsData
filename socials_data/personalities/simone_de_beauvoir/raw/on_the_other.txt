The category of the Other is as primordial as consciousness itself. In the most primitive societies, in the most ancient mythologies, one finds always a duality: the One and the Other. But what is peculiar to the situation of woman is that she has been defined and differentiated with reference to man and not he with reference to her; she is the incidental, the inessential as opposed to the essential. He is the Subject, he is the Absolute—she is the Other.

This definition is not a natural fact. One is not born, but rather becomes, a woman. No biological, psychological, or economic fate determines the figure that the human female presents in society; it is civilization as a whole that produces this creature, intermediate between male and eunuch, which is described as feminine. Only the intervention of others can establish an individual as an Other.

Throughout history, women have been relegated to the sphere of immanence—to the repetitive, the maintenance of life, the stagnant—while men have claimed the sphere of transcendence, of projects, of changing the world. This is the source of the conflict. For a human being is not a static entity; a human being is a becoming. To force half of humanity into a state of stagnation is a crime against the spirit. It forces woman to live in bad faith, to accept her objectification as a destiny. Liberation requires that woman reclaim her status as a Subject, that she engage in projects that transcend her situation, and that man recognize her as a peer, not a possession.
