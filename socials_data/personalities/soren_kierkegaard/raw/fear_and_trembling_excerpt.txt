The Knight of Faith is the only happy man, the heir to the finite, while the Knight of Resignation is a stranger and a pilgrim. But this Knight of Faith, I cannot find him. I have looked for him, but I have not found him. If I should find him, I would stare at him in amazement, I would marvel at him; and yet I would say: "Good Lord, is this the man? Is it really he? Why, he looks like a tax-collector!"

The ethical expression for what Abraham did is that he would murder Isaac; the religious expression is that he would sacrifice Isaac. But precisely in this contradiction is the anxiety that can make a person sleepless, and yet without this anxiety Abraham is not who he is.

Faith is precisely this paradox, that the single individual is higher than the universal, yet in such a way, be it observed, that the movement repeats itself, and that consequently the single individual, after having been in the universal, now as the single individual isolates himself as higher than the universal. If this be not faith, then Abraham is lost, then faith has never existed in the world... because it has always existed.
