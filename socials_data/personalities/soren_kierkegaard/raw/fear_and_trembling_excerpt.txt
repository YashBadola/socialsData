Preface

Not only in the world of commerce but also in the world of ideas our age is putting on a veritable clearance sale. Everything can be had so dirt cheap that one begins to wonder whether in the end anyone will want to make a bid. Every speculative price-fixer who conscientiously directs attention to the significant march of modern philosophy, every Privatdocent, tutor, and student, every crofter and cottar in philosophy, is not content with stopping at doubting everything but goes further. Perhaps it would be untimely and ill-timed to ask them where they are going, but surely it is courteous and oblivious to assume that they have doubted everything, since otherwise it would be queer to say that they were going further. This proceeding of theirs has anticipated me and made my task easier, for I do not deny that it was my own previous resolve not to stop with doubting everything. Now, on the contrary, I can restrict myself to the humbler task of giving an account of that which I have personally experienced, not just as a runner in the race but as one of the many whom time has left behind, though he too had a youth and though he too forgets not the follies of his youth. I am, then, by no means a philosopher. I am poetice et eleganter [poetically and elegantly] a freelance writer who neither writes the system nor promises of the system, who neither subscribes to the system nor ascribes anything to it. I write because to me it is a luxury that becomes the more agreeable and evident the fewer there are who buy and read what I write.

Faith is precisely this paradox, that the single individual as the single individual is higher than the universal, is justified before it, not as inferior to it but as superior—yet in such a way, please note, that it is the single individual who, after being subordinate as the single individual to the universal, now by means of the universal becomes the single individual who as the single individual is superior, that the single individual as the single individual stands in an absolute relation to the absolute. This position cannot be mediated, for all mediation comes about precisely by virtue of the universal; it is and remains to all eternity a paradox, inaccessible to thought. And yet faith is this paradox—or else (these are the logical deductions which I would beg the reader to have in mente [in mind] at every point, though it would be too prolix for me to reiterate them on every occasion)—or else there is no faith at all, but Abraham is lost, or else there has never been faith in the world precisely because the world has been under the impression that faith is something different; or else we must suspend the ethical, for the ethical as such is the universal, and as the universal it is divine. But as has been said, I am by no means a philosopher. I have not understood the system, whether there is one, whether it is completed; it is enough for my weak head to have thought what a prodigious head everyone must have in these times when everyone has such prodigious thoughts. Even if one were able to translate the whole of the content of faith into the form of a concept, it would not follow that he had comprehended faith, comprehended how he entered into it or how it entered into him. The absolute duty may then be expressed in this way: the individual is higher than the universal. The paradox of faith is this, that there is an interiority that is incommensurable with the exteriority, an interiority which, it is true, is not identical with the first, but is a new interiority. This is the paradox which the Knight of Faith is capable of resolving, and it is the paradox which the Knight of Resignation is unable to resolve.
