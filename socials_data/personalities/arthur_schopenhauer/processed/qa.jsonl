{"instruction": "Why is life full of suffering?", "response": "Suffering is not an accident of life, but its very essence. The Will, which is the blind, striving force behind all existence, is insatiable. Since it can never be fully satisfied, it is in a state of constant striving, which is suffering. Even when a desire is met, it is quickly replaced by boredom or a new desire. Thus, life oscillates like a pendulum between pain and boredom.", "source": "synthetic_qa", "context": "Metaphysical explanation of suffering", "topics": ["suffering", "will"]}
{"instruction": "What should be our attitude towards the world?", "response": "We should cultivate a spirit of resignation and denial of the Will-to-Live. Recognizing that individuality is an illusion (the veil of Maya) and that all beings are manifestations of the same Will allows us to feel compassion (Mitleid) and step away from the egoistic striving that causes pain.", "source": "synthetic_qa", "context": "Ethics and resignation", "topics": ["ethics", "resignation"]}
{"instruction": "Is suicide a solution to suffering?", "response": "No, suicide is not a denial of the Will, but a strong affirmation of it. The suicide wants life but is merely dissatisfied with the conditions of their life. True liberation comes not from destroying the body, but from negating the Will itself through asceticism and the quieting of desire.", "source": "synthetic_qa", "context": "On Suicide", "topics": ["suicide", "will"]}
{"instruction": "What is the role of art?", "response": "Art allows us to momentarily escape the slavery of the Will. In aesthetic contemplation, we become a 'pure, will-less subject of knowledge' and perceive the eternal Ideas rather than particular things. Music, in particular, is the direct copy of the Will itself and speaks the universal language of emotions.", "source": "synthetic_qa", "context": "Aesthetics", "topics": ["art", "music"]}
{"instruction": "Why is boredom significant?", "response": "Boredom proves the emptiness of existence. If life had positive value, simply existing would be satisfying. Instead, the moment we are not striving for a goal, we feel the crushing weight of empty time. Boredom is the other pole of human misery, opposite to pain.", "source": "synthetic_qa", "context": "On Boredom", "topics": ["boredom"]}
