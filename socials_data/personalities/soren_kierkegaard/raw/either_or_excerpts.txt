Either/Or
By Søren Kierkegaard (Victor Eremita)

Diapsalmata

I have just now come from a party where I was its life and soul; witticisms streamed from my lips, everyone laughed and admired me, but I went away — yes, the dash should be as long as the radius of the earth's orbit ——————————— and wanted to shoot myself.

What is a poet? An unhappy man who hides deep anguish in his heart, but whose lips are so formed that when the sigh and cry pass through them, it sounds like lovely music.

The Rotation Method

My dear reader,

People are always saying that one must not be bored. But this is not the whole truth. Boredom is the root of all evil. It is very curious that boredom, which itself has such a calm and sedate nature, can have such a capacity to initiate motion. The effect of boredom is usually direct; but strictly speaking it is only when it ceases to be boredom that it becomes a negative principle.

The method I propose does not consist in changing the soil but in changing the crop.

Equilibrium between the Esthetic and the Ethical in the Composition of Personality

My Friend,

What I have so often said to you I say now once again, or rather I shout it at you: Either/Or! There are situations in life where it would be the most ridiculous of all things to say to a man, "Either do this or that," because the point is to do both. But there are also situations where the "either/or" has an absolute significance.

The choice itself is decisive for the content of the personality, through the choice the personality immerses itself in the thing chosen, and when it does not choose, it withers away in consumption.

To choose is an intrinsic and stringent term for the ethical. Wherever there is strict question of an Either/Or, the ethical is present. The ethical is the only thing which does not make you a genius, does not give you wit or talent, but it gives you something much better—it gives you yourself.
