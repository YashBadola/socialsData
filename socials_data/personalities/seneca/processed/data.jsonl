{"text": "Greetings from Seneca to his friend Lucilius.\nDO you ask me what you should regard as especially to be avoided? I say, crowds; for as yet you cannot trust yourself to them with safety. I shall admit my own weakness, at any rate; for I never bring back home the same character that I took abroad with me. Something of that which I have forced to be calm within me is disturbed; some of the foes that I have routed return again. Just as the sick man, who has been weak for a long time, is in such a condition that he cannot be taken out of the house without suffering a relapse, so we ourselves are affected when our souls are recovering from a lingering disease.\nTo consort with the crowd is harmful; there is no person who does not make some vice attractive to us, or stamp it upon us, or taint us unconsciously. Certainly, the greater the mob with which we mingle, the greater the danger. But nothing is so damaging to good character as the habit of lounging at the games; for then it is that vice steals subtly upon one through the avenue of pleasure. What do you think I mean? I mean that I come home more greedy, more ambitious, more voluptuous, and even more cruel and inhuman, because I have been among human beings. By chance I attended a mid-day exhibition, expecting some fun, wit, and relaxation,\u2014an exhibition at which men's eyes have respite from the slaughter of their fellow-men. But it was quite the reverse. The previous combats were the essence of mercy; but now all the trifling is put aside and it is pure murder. The men have no defensive armour. They are exposed to blows at all points, and no one ever strikes in vain. Many persons prefer this programme to the usual pairs and to the bouts \"by request.\" Of course they do; there is no helmet or shield to deflect the weapon. What is the need of defensive armour, or of skill? All these mean delaying death. In the morning they throw men to the lions and the bears; at noon, they throw them to the spectators. The spectators demand that the slayer shall face the man who is to slay him in his turn; and they always reserve the latest conqueror for another butchery. The outcome of every fight is death, and the means are fire and sword. This sort of thing goes on while the arena is empty. You may retort: \"But he was a highway robber; he killed a man!\" And what of it? Granted that, as a murderer, he deserved this punishment, what crime have you committed, poor fellow, that you should deserve to sit and see this show? In the morning they cried \"Kill him! Lash him! Burn him! Why does he meet the sword in so cowardly a way? Why does he strike so feebly? Why doesn't he die game? Whip him to meet his wounds! Let them receive blow for blow, with chests bare and exposed to the stroke!\" And when the games stop for the intermission, they announce: \"A little throat-cutting in the meantime, so that there may still be something going on!\"\nCome now; do you not understand even this truth: that a bad example reacts on the agent? Thank the immortal gods that you are teaching cruelty to a person who cannot learn to be cruel. The young character, which cannot hold fast to righteousness, must be rescued from the mob; it is too easy to side with the majority. Even Socrates, Cato, and Laelius might have been shaken in their moral strength by a crowd that was unlike them; so true it is that none of us, no matter how much he cultivates his abilities, can withstand the shock of faults that approach, as it were, with so great a retinue. Much harm is done by a single case of indulgence or greed; the familiar friend, if he be luxurious, weakens and softens us imperceptibly; the neighbour, if he be rich, rouses our covetousness; the companion, if he be slanderous, rubs off some of his rust upon us, even though we be spotless and sincere. What then do you think the effect will be on character, when the world at large assaults it! You must either imitate or loathe the world.\nBut both courses are to be shunned; you should not copy the bad simply because they are many, nor should you hate the many because they are unlike you. Withdraw into yourself, as far as you can. Associate with those who will make a better man of you. Welcome those whom you yourself can improve. The process is mutual; for men learn while they teach. There is no reason why pride in advertising your abilities should lure you into publicity, so that you should desire to recite or harangue before the general public. Of course I should be willing for you to do so if you had a stock-in-trade that suited such a mob; but there is not a man of them who can understand you. One or two individuals will perhaps come in your way, but even these will have to be moulded and trained by you so that they will understand you. You may say: \"For what purpose did I learn all these things?\" But you need not fear that you have wasted your efforts; it was for yourself that you learned them.\nIn order, however, that I may not to-day have learned exclusively for myself, I shall share with you three excellent sayings, of the same general purport, which have come to my attention. This letter will give you one of them as payment of my debt; the other two you may accept as a contribution in advance. Democritus says: \"One man means as much to me as a multitude, and a multitude only as much as one man.\" The following also was nobly spoken by someone or other, for it is doubtful who the author was; they asked him what was the object of all this study applied to an art that would reach but very few. He replied: \"I am content with few, content with one, content with none at all.\" The third saying\u2014and a noteworthy one, too\u2014is by Epicurus, written to one of the partners of his studies: \"I write this not for the many, but for you; each of us is enough of an audience for the other.\" Lay these up in your heart, my dear Lucilius, that you may scorn the pleasure which comes from the applause of the majority. Many men praise you; but have you any reason for being pleased with yourself, if you are a person whom the many can understand? Your good qualities should face inwards.

{"text": "Greetings from Seneca to his friend Lucilius.\nCONTINUE to act thus, my dear Lucilius\u2014set yourself free for your own sake; gather and save your time, which till lately has been forced from you, or filched away, or has merely slipped from your hands. Make yourself believe the truth of my words\u2014that certain moments are torn from us, that some are gently removed, and that others glide beyond our reach. The most disgraceful kind of loss, however, is that due to carelessness. Furthermore, if you will pay close heed to the problem, you will find that the largest portion of our life passes while we are doing ill, a goodly share while we are doing nothing, and the whole while we are doing that which is not to the purpose.\nWhat man can you show me who places any value on his time, who reckons the worth of each day, who understands that he is dying daily? For we are mistaken when we look forward to death; the major portion of death has already passed. Whatever years be behind us are in death's hands. Therefore, Lucilius, do as you write me that you are doing: hold every hour in your grasp. Lay hold of to-day's task, and you will not need to depend so much upon to-morrow's. While we are postponing, life speeds by. Nothing, Lucilius, is ours, except time. We were entrusted by nature with the ownership of this single thing, so fleeting and slippery that anyone who will can oust us from possession. What fools these mortals be! They allow the cheapest and most useless things, which can easily be replaced, to be charged in the reckoning, after they have acquired them; but they never regard themselves as in debt when they have received some of that precious commodity,\u2014time! And yet time is the one loan which even a grateful recipient cannot repay.\nYou may desire to know how I, who preach to you so freely, am practising. I confess that, in the case of one who is spendthrift but careful, my account is balanced. I cannot boast that I waste nothing, but I can at least tell you what I am wasting, and the cause and manner of the loss; I can give you the reasons why I am a poor man. My situation, however, is the same as that of many who are reduced to slender means through no fault of their own: every one forgives them, but no one comes to their rescue.\nWhat is the state of things, then? It is this: I do not regard a man as poor, if the little which remains is enough for him. I advise you, however, to keep what is really yours; and you cannot begin too early. For, as our ancestors believed, it is too late to spare when you reach the dregs of the cask. Of that which remains at the bottom, the amount is slight, and the quality is vile.

{"text": "We have now to see whether anger is in accordance with nature, and whether it is useful and, in some measure, worth keeping.\nWhether it is in accordance with nature will become evident if we look at man. What is more gentle than man while he is in a right state of mind? But what is more cruel than anger? What is more loving to others than man? What more hostile than anger? Man is born to assist, anger to destroy. Man seeks to combine, anger to separate. Man is beneficial, anger is destructive. Man helps even strangers, anger attacks even the dearest friends. Man is ready to sacrifice himself for the good of others, anger to plunge into peril if it can but drag another down with it. Who, then, is more ignorant of the nature of things than he who ascribes this savage and pernicious vice to Nature\u2019s best and most polished work?\nAnger, as I have said, is eager to punish; and that such a desire should exist in man's peaceful breast is least of all according to his nature; for human life is founded on benefits and harmony, and is bound together into an alliance for the common help, not by terror, but by mutual love.\n\"What then? Is not correction sometimes necessary?\" Of course it is; but with discretion, not with anger. For it will not hurt, but will heal under the guise of hurting. Just as we apply the flame to the spear-shaft, not to burn it, but to straighten it, so we correct our fellow-men, not for the sake of hurting them, but to improve them.\n\"But,\" you say, \"anger is useful, because it makes men more ready to fight.\" That is like saying that drunkenness is useful because it makes men bold and reckless, or that madness is useful because it gives men great strength. But these things are not useful; they are merely dangerous. The strength that they give is not the strength of health, but the strength of delirium.\nReason is strong only so long as it stands aloof from the passions; if it once mixes with them, it loses its authority and cannot hold them in check. The mind, if it plunges into anger, love, or the other passions, has no power to check its own impetuosity; its weight and the downward tendency of its vice must needs carry it on and drive it to the bottom.\nTherefore, the best plan is to reject straightway the first incentives to anger, to resist its very beginnings, and to take care not to be betrayed into it: for if once it begins to carry us away, it is hard to stop the course, because, when once the mind has been thrown off its balance, it has no longer any control over itself.", "source": "on_anger_excerpt.txt"}
