Preface

Not only in the world of commerce but also in the world of ideas our age is putting on a veritable clearance sale. Everything is to be had at such a bargain that it is doubtful whether in the end there is anyone who will want to bid. Every speculative price-fixer who conscientiously directs attention to the significant march of modern philosophy, every privat-docent, tutor, and student, every crofter and cottar in philosophy, is not content with doubting everything but goes further. Perhaps it would be untimely and ill-timed to ask them where they are going, but surely it is courteous and unobtrusive to assume that they have doubted everything, since otherwise it would be queer for them to be going further. Having made this preliminary movement, they have thus prepared themselves to follow the straight path of the System, and only when they have arrived at the end of it, only when they have reached the Truth, will they have time to doubt everything—unless by that time they have forgotten how to doubt.

Whatever one may think of this, it is certain that in our time we hear very little about faith. I do not mean to say that it is not preached in the churches, but it is preached in such a way that it seems as if the whole congregation knew what faith is, as if the only thing lacking were a little more fervour, a little more inwardness. But if this is so, then faith must be something very easy, something which perhaps even the most immediate of immediate men has. And yet in the old days it was different; faith was then a task for a whole lifetime, because it was assumed that proficiency in believing is not acquired in a few days or weeks. When the tried old soldier approaches the end of his life, he answers the young man who asks him about the way: "It is long and hard." But nowadays everyone has faith, for everyone is going further.

The Story of Abraham

There was once a man who as a child had heard the beautiful story about how God tempted Abraham, and how he withstood the temptation, kept the faith, and a second time received a son contrary to expectation. When the child became older, he read the same story with even greater admiration, for life had separated what was united in the pious simplicity of the child. The older he became, the more frequently his thoughts turned to that story, his enthusiasm became greater and greater, and yet less and less could he understand the story. At last he forgot everything else in his thoughts of Abraham; his soul had but one wish, to see Abraham, one longing, to have been witness to that event. His desire was not to see the beautiful countries of the Orient, or the earthly glory of the Promised Land, or that god-fearing couple whose old age God had blessed, or the venerable figure of the aged patriarch, or the vigorous youth of Isaac, whom God had bestowed upon Abraham—he wished to be present only when God tempted Abraham. He wished to see how Abraham lifted the knife.

He had not yet learned that there is a difference between the result and the way, and that the result is easier to understand than the way. He did not know that the result is the aesthetic, the way the ethical; that the result is the external, the way the internal; that the result is the finite, the way the infinite.
