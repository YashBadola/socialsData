"The specific character of despair is precisely this: it is unaware of being despair."

"To have a self, to be a self, is the greatest concession made to man, but at the same time it is eternity’s demand upon him."

"The self is a relation that relates itself to itself or is the relation's relating itself to itself in the relation; the self is not the relation but that the relation relates itself to itself.

Considered in this way, a human being is still not a self."
