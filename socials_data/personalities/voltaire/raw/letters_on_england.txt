LETTER I. ON THE QUAKERS.

I thought that the doctrine and history of so extraordinary a people were worthy the attention of the curious. To acquaint myself with them I made a visit to one of the most eminent Quakers in England, who after having traded thirty years had with the wisdom of an honourable retreat to an house near London. I went to him in my crowd of acquaintances, and having no other recommendation than that of my being a foreigner. He received me with his hat on, and advanced towards me without making the least bow; but there was more politeness in the open, humane air of his countenance, than in the custom of drawing one leg behind the other, and carrying that in the hand which is made to cover the head. "Friend," said he to me, "I see thou art a stranger; if I can be of any service to thee, thou hast only to speak." "Sir," said I to him, bowing and gliding one foot towards him, according to our custom, "I flatter myself that my just curiosity will not displease you, and that you will do me the honour to inform me of your religion." "The people of thy country," answered he, "are too full of their bows and compliments; but I have never yet seen one of them who had the same curiosity. Come in, and let us first dine together." I made some more bad compliments, because I could not suddenly divest myself of my general habits; and after a wholesome and frugal meal, which began and ended with a prayer to God, I began to question my plain host. I opened with that which good Catholics have more than once made to Huguenots. "My dear sir," said I, "are you baptized?" "No," said the Quaker, "nor are my brethren." "How, morbleu," replied I, "are you not Christians?" "My friend," said he, "swear not; we are Christians, and endeavour to be good Christians, but we are not of opinion that the sprinkling water on a child's head makes him a Christian." "Christians, and not baptized," said I, "hell is certainly your portion! Do not you know that in the Greek the word baptism signifies washing?" "It does," said he; "but we do not think that the washing the body washes the soul; and we do not choose to be Christians by the half."

LETTER V. ON THE CHURCH OF ENGLAND.

This is the country of sects. An Englishman, as a freeman, goes to heaven by whatever road he pleases.

However, although every one here may serve God in his own way, their true religion, that in which a man makes his fortune, is the sect of Episcopalians or Church of England, or Law Church. No person can possess an employment either in England or Ireland unless he be ranked among the faithful of the Church of England. This reason (which carries mathematical evidence with it) has converted such numbers of dissenters of all persuasions, that not a twentieth part of the nation is out of the pale of the dominant church. The clergy of this church have retained a great number of the Romish ceremonies, and especially that of receiving their tithes with a most scrupulous attention. They also have the pious ambition of being the masters.

Moreover, the real ambition of an English citizen is to be a rich man; and as the church is a very rich and honorable profession, a great number of men of wit and learning are to be found among the clergy.

LETTER VI. ON THE PRESBYTERIANS.

The Church of England is confined almost to the kingdom of England and Ireland, for Presbyterianism is the established religion in Scotland. This Presbyterianism is directly the same with Calvinism, as it was established in France, and is now professed at Geneva. As the priests of this sect receive but very indifferent stipends from their churches, and consequently cannot emulate the splendid luxury of bishops, they exclaim very naturally against honors which they can never attain to. Figure to yourself the haughty Diogenes trampling under foot the pride of Plato. The Scotch Presbyterians are not very unlike that proud though tattered reasoner. Diogenes did not treat Alexander with half the insolence with which these treated King Charles II.; for when they took up arms in his cause in opposition to Cromwell, who had deceived them, they forced that poor monarch to undergo the hearing of three or four sermons every day, would not suffer him to play, reduced him to a state of penance and mortification, so that Charles soon grew sick of these pedants, and escaped from them with as much joy as a youth does from school.
