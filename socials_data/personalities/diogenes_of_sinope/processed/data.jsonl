Diogenes plucked a fowl and brought it into the lecture-room with the words, \"Behold Plato's man!\"\nWhen asked what was the proper time for lunch, he said, \"If a rich man, when you will; if a poor man, when you can.\"\nAlexander the Great found the philosopher looking attentively at a pile of human bones. Diogenes explained, \"I am searching for the bones of your father but cannot distinguish them from those of a slave.\"\nWhen Alexander the Great asked Diogenes if he could do anything for him, Diogenes replied, \"Yes, stand out of my sunlight.\"\nDiogenes was known for carrying a lantern during the day, claiming to be looking for an honest man.\nSomeone took him into a magnificent house and warned him not to spit, whereupon having cleared his throat he spat into the man's face, being unable, he said, to find a meaner receptacle.\nWhen asked where he came from, he said, \"I am a citizen of the world.\"\nHe used to beg of statues, and when asked why he did so, he said, \"To get practice in being refused.\"\nSeeing a child drinking from his hands, he threw away his cup and said, \"A child has beaten me in plainness of living.\"\nWhen asked what was the most beautiful thing in the world, he replied, \"Freedom of speech.\"\nOf what use is a philosopher who doesn't hurt anybody's feelings?\nIt is not that I am mad, it is only that my head is different from yours.\nDiscourse on virtue and they pass by in droves, whistle and dance the shimmy, and you've got an audience.\nI pissed on the man who called me a dog. Why was he so surprised?\nThe art of being a slave is to rule one's master.\nPeople who talk well but do nothing are like musical instruments; the sound is all they have to offer.", "source": "anecdotes.txt"}
