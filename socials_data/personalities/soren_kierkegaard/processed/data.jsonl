{"text": "FEAR AND TREMBLING\nINTRODUCTION II\nNot only in the world of commerce but also in the world of ideas our\nage has arranged a regular clearance-sale. Everything may be had at\nsuch absurdly low prices that very soon the question will arise whether\nany one cares to bid. Every waiter with a speculative turn who\ncarefully marks the significant progress of modern philosophy, every\nlecturer in philosophy, every tutor, student, every sticker-and-quitter\nof philosophy\u2014they are not content with doubting everything, but \"go\nright on.\" It might, possibly, be ill-timed and inopportune to ask them\nwhither they are bound; but it is no doubt polite and modest to take it\nfor granted that they have doubted everything\u2014else it were a curious\nstatement for them to make, that they were proceeding onward. So they\nhave, all of them, completed that preliminary operation and, it would\nseem, with such ease that they do not think it necessary to waste a\nword about how they did it. The fact is, not even he who looked\nanxiously and with a troubled spirit for some little point of\ninformation, ever found one, nor any instruction, nor even any little\ndietetic prescription, as to how one is to accomplish this enormous\ntask. \"But did not Descartes proceed in this fashion?\" Descartes,\nindeed! that venerable, humble, honest thinker whose writings surely no\none can read without deep emotion\u2014Descartes did what he said, and said\nwhat he did. Alas, alas! that is a mighty rare thing in our times! But\nDescartes, as he says frequently enough, never uttered doubts\nconcerning his faith....\nIn our times, as was remarked, no one is content with faith, but \"goes\nright on.\" The question as to whither they are proceeding may be a\nsilly question; whereas it is a sign of urbanity and culture to assume\nthat every one has faith, to begin with, for else it were a curious\nstatement for them to make, that they are proceeding further. In the\nolden days it was different. Then, faith was a task for a whole\nlife-time because it was held that proficiency in faith was not to be\nwon within a few days or weeks. Hence, when the tried patriarch felt\nhis end approaching, after having fought his battles and preserved his\nfaith, he was still young enough at heart not to have forgotten the\nfear and trembling which disciplined his youth and which the mature man\nhas under control, but which no one entirely outgrows\u2014except insofar as\nhe succeeds in \"going on\" as early as possible. The goal which those\nvenerable men reached at last\u2014at that spot every one starts, in our\ntimes, in order to \"proceed further.\"...\nPREPARATION\nThere lived a man who, when a child, had heard the beautiful Bible\nstory of how God tempted Abraham and how he stood the test, how he\nmaintained his faith and, against his expectations, received his son\nback again. As this man grew older he read this same story with ever\ngreater admiration; for now life had separated what had been united in\nthe reverent simplicity of the child. And the older he grew, the more\nfrequently his thoughts reverted to that story. His enthusiasm waxed\nstronger and stronger, and yet the story grew less and less clear to\nhim. Finally he forgot everything else in thinking about it, and his\nsoul contained but one wish, which was, to behold Abraham: and but one\nlonging, which was, to have been witness to that event. His desire was,\nnot to see the beautiful lands of the Orient, and not the splendor of\nthe Promised Land, and not the reverent couple whose old age the Lord\nhad blessed with children, and not the venerable figure of the aged\npatriarch, and not the god-given vigorous youth of Isaac\u2014it would have\nbeen the same to him if the event had come to pass on some barren\nheath. But his wish was, to have been with Abraham on the three days'\njourney, when he rode with sorrow before him and with Isaac at his\nside. His wish was, to have been present at the moment when Abraham\nlifted up his eyes and saw Mount Moriah afar off; to have been present\nat the moment when he left his asses behind and wended his way up to\nthe mountain alone with Isaac. For the mind of this man was busy, not\nwith the delicate conceits of the imagination, but rather with his\nshuddering thought.\nThe man we speak of was no thinker, he felt no desire to go beyond his\nfaith: it seemed to him the most glorious fate to be remembered as the\nFather of Faith, and a most enviable lot to be possessed of that faith,\neven if no one knew it.\nThe man we speak of was no learned exegetist, he did not even\nunderstand Hebrew\u2014who knows but a knowledge of Hebrew might have helped\nhim to understand readily both the story and Abraham.\nI\nAnd God tempted Abraham and said unto him: take Isaac, thine only son,\nwhom thou lovest and go to the land Moriah and sacrifice him there on a\nmountain which I shall show thee.[156][1]\nIt was in the early morning, Abraham arose betimes and had his asses\nsaddled. He departed from his tent, and Isaac with him; but Sarah\nlooked out of the window after them until they were out of sight.\nSilently they rode for three days; but on the fourth morning Abraham\nsaid not a word but lifted up his eyes and beheld Mount Moriah in the\ndistance. He left his servants behind and, leading Isaac by the hand,\nhe approached the mountain. But Abraham said to himself: \"I shall\nsurely conceal from Isaac whither he is going.\" He stood still, he laid\nhis hand on Isaac's head to bless him, and Isaac bowed down to receive\nhis blessing. And Abraham's aspect was fatherly, his glance was mild,\nhis speech admonishing. But Isaac understood him not, his soul would\nnot rise to him; he embraced Abraham's knees, he besought him at his\nfeet, he begged for his young life, for his beautiful hopes, he\nrecalled the joy in Abraham's house when he was born, he reminded him\nof the sorrow and the loneliness that would be after him. Then did\nAbraham raise up the youth and lead him by his hand, and his words were\nfull of consolation and admonishment. But Isaac understood him not. He\nascended Mount Moriah, but Isaac understood him not. Then Abraham\naverted his face for a moment; but when Isaac looked again, his\nfather's countenance was changed, his glance wild, his aspect terrible,\nhe seized Isaac and threw him to the ground and said: \"Thou foolish\nlad, believest thou I am thy father? An idol-worshipper am I. Believest\nthou it is God's command? Nay, but my pleasure.\" Then Isaac trembled\nand cried out in his fear: \"God in heaven, have pity on me, God of\nAbraham, show mercy to me, I have no father on earth, be thou then my\nfather!\" But Abraham said softly to himself: \"Father in heaven, I thank\nthee. Better is it that he believes me inhuman than that he should lose\nhis faith in thee.\"\nWhen the child is to be weaned, his mother blackens her breast; for it\nwere a pity if her breast should look sweet to him when he is not to\nhave it. Then the child believes that her breast has changed; but his\nmother is ever the same, her glance is full of love and as tender as\never. Happy he who needed not worse means to wean his child!\nII\nIt was in the early morning. Abraham arose betimes and embraced Sarah,\nthe bride of his old age. And Sarah kissed Isaac who had taken the\nshame from her\u2014Isaac, her pride, her hope for all coming generations.\nThen the twain rode silently along their way, and Abraham's glance was\nfastened on the ground before him; until on the fourth day, when he\nlifted up his eyes and beheld Mount Moriah in the distance; but then\nhis eyes again sought the ground. Without a word he put the fagots in\norder and bound Isaac, and without a word he unsheathed his knife. Then\nhe beheld the ram God had chosen, and sacrificed him, and wended his\nway home.... From that day on Abraham, grew old. He could not forget\nthat God had required this of him. Isaac flourished as before; but\nAbraham's eye was darkened, he saw happiness no more.\nWhen the child has grown and is to be weaned, his mother will in\nmaidenly fashion conceal her breast. Then the child has a mother no\nlonger. Happy the child who lost not his mother in any other sense!\nIII\nIt was in the early morning. Abraham arose betimes; he kissed Sarah,\nthe young mother, and Sarah kissed Isaac, her joy, her delight for all\ntimes. And Abraham rode on his way, lost in thought\u2014he was thinking of\nHagar and her son whom he had driven out into the wilderness. He\nascended Mount Moriah and he drew the knife.\nIt was a calm evening when Abraham rode out alone, and he rode to Mount\nMoriah. There he cast himself down on his face and prayed to God to\nforgive him his sin in that he had been about to sacrifice his son\nIsaac, and in that the father had forgotten his duty toward his son.\nAnd yet oftener he rode on his lonely way, but he found no rest. He\ncould not grasp that it was a sin that he had wanted to sacrifice to\nGod his most precious possession, him for whom he would most gladly\nhave died many times. But, if it was a sin, if he had not loved Isaac\nthus, then could he not grasp the possibility that he could be\nforgiven: for what sin more terrible?\nWhen the child is to be weaned, the mother is not without sorrow that\nshe and her child are to be separated more and more, that the child who\nhad first lain under her heart, and afterwards at any rate rested at\nher breast, is to be so near to her no more. So they sorrow together\nfor that brief while. Happy he who kept his child so near to him and\nneeded not to sorrow more!\nIV\nIt was in the early morning. All was ready for the journey in the house\nof Abraham. He bade farewell to Sarah; and Eliezer, his faithful\nservant, accompanied him along the way for a little while. They rode\ntogether in peace, Abraham and Isaac, until they came to Mount Moriah.\nAnd Abraham prepared everything for the sacrifice, calmly and mildly;\nbut when his father turned aside in order to unsheathe his knife, Isaac\nsaw that Abraham's left hand was knit in despair and that a trembling\nshook his frame\u2014but Abraham drew forth the knife.\nThen they returned home again, and Sarah hastened to meet them; but\nIsaac had lost his faith. No one in all the world ever said a word\nabout this, nor did Isaac speak to any man concerning what he had seen,\nand Abraham suspected not that any one had seen it.\nWhen the child is to be weaned, his mother has the stronger food ready\nlest the child perish. Happy he who has in readiness this stronger\nfood!\nThus, and in many similar ways, thought the man whom I have mentioned\nabout this event. And every time he returned, after a pilgrimage to\nMount Moriah, he sank down in weariness, folding his hands and saying:\n\"No one, in truth, was great as was Abraham, and who can understand\nhim?\"\nA PANEGYRIC ON ABRAHAM\nIf a consciousness of the eternal were not implanted in man; if the\nbasis of all that exists were but a confusedly fermenting element\nwhich, convulsed by obscure passions, produced all, both the great and\nthe insignificant; if under everything there lay a bottomless void\nnever to be filled\u2014what else were life but despair? If it were thus,\nand if there were no sacred bonds between man and man; if one\ngeneration arose after another, as in the forest the leaves of one\nseason succeed the leaves of another, or like the songs of birds which\nare taken up one after another; if the generations of man passed\nthrough the world like a ship passing through the sea and the wind over\nthe desert\u2014a fruitless and a vain thing; if eternal oblivion were ever\ngreedily watching for its prey and there existed no power strong enough\nto wrest it from its clutches\u2014how empty were life then, and how dismal!\nAnd therefore it is not thus; but, just as God created man and woman,\nhe likewise called into being the hero and the poet or orator. The\nlatter cannot perform the deeds of the hero\u2014he can only admire and love\nhim and rejoice in him. And yet he also is happy and not less so; for\nthe hero is, as it were, his better self with which he has fallen in\nlove, and he is glad he is not himself the hero, so that his love can\nexpress itself in admiration.\nThe poet is the genius of memory, and does nothing but recall what has\nbeen done, can do nothing but admire what has been done. He adds\nnothing of his own, but he is jealous of what has been entrusted to\nhim. He obeys the choice of his own heart; but once he has found what\nhe has been seeking, he visits every man's door with his song and with\nhis speech, so that all may admire the hero as he does, and be proud of\nthe hero as he is. This is his achievement, his humble work, this is\nhis faithful service in the house of the hero. If thus, faithful to his\nlove, he battles day and night against the guile of oblivion which\nwishes to lure the hero from him, then has he accomplished his task,\nthen is he gathered to his hero who loves him as faithfully; for the\npoet is at it were the hero's better self, unsubstantial, to be sure,\nlike a mere memory, but also transfigured as is a memory. Therefore\nshall no one be forgotten who has done great deeds; and even if there\nbe delay, even if the cloud of misunderstanding obscure the hero from\nour vision, still his lover will come some time; and the more time has\npassed, the more faithfully will he cleave to him.\nNo, no one shall be forgotten who was great in this world. But each\nhero was great in his own way, and each one was eminent in proportion\nto the great things he loved. For he who loved himself became great\nthrough himself, and he who loved others became great through his\ndevotion, but he who loved God became greater than all of these.\nEveryone of them shall be remembered, but each one became great in\nproportion to his trust. One became great by hoping for the possible;\nanother, by hoping for the eternal; but he who hoped for the\nimpossible, he became greater than all of these. Every one shall be\nremembered; but each one was great in proportion to the power with\nwhich he strove. For he who strove with the world became great by\novercoming himself; but he who strove with God, he became the greatest\nof them all. Thus there have been struggles in the world, man against\nman, one against a thousand; but he who struggled with God, he became\ngreatest of them all. Thus there was fighting on this earth, and there\nwas he who conquered everything by his strength, and there was he who\nconquered God by his weakness. There was he who, trusting in himself,\ngained all; and there was he who, trusting in his strength sacrificed\neverything; but he who believed in God was greater than all of these.\nThere was he who was great through his strength, and he who was great\nthrough his wisdom, and he who was great through his hopes, and he who\nwas great through his love; but Abraham was greater than all of\nthese\u2014great through the strength whose power is weakness, great through\nthe wisdom whose secret is folly, great through the hope whose\nexpression is madness, great through the love which is hatred of one's\nself.\nThrough the urging of his faith Abraham left the land of his\nforefathers and became a stranger in the land of promise. Ke left one\nthing behind and took one thing along: he left his worldly wisdom\nbehind and took with him faith. For else he would not have left the\nland of his fathers, but would have thought it an unreasonable demand.\nThrough his faith he came to be a stranger in the land of promise,\nwhere there was nothing to remind him of all that had been dear to him,\nbut where everything by its newness tempted his soul to longing. And\nyet was he God's chosen, he in whom the Lord was well pleased! Indeed,\nhad he been one cast off, one thrust out of God's mercy, then might he\nhave comprehended it; but now it seemed like a mockery of him and of\nhis faith. There have been others who lived in exile from the\nfatherland which they loved. They are not forgotten, nor is the song of\nlament forgotten in which they mournfully sought and found what they\nhad lost. Of Abraham there exists no song of lamentation. It is human\nto complain, it is human to weep with the weeping; but it is greater to\nbelieve, and more blessed to consider him who has faith.\nThrough his faith Abraham received the promise that in his seed were to\nbe blessed all races of mankind. Time passed, there was still the\npossibility of it, and Abraham had faith. Another man there was who\nalso lived in hopes. Time passed, the evening of his life was\napproaching; neither was he paltry enough to have forgotten his hopes:\nneither shall he be forgotten by us! Then he sorrowed, and his sorrow\ndid not deceive him, as life had done, but gave him all it could; for\nin the sweetness of sorrow he became possessed of his disappointed\nhopes. It is human to sorrow, it is human to sorrow with the sorrowing;\nbut it is greater to have faith, and more blessed to consider him who\nhas faith.\nNo song of lamentation has come down to us from Abraham. He did not\nsadly count the days as time passed; he did not look at Sarah with\nsuspicious eyes, whether she was becoming old; he did not stop the\nsun's course lest Sarah should grow old and his hope with her; he did\nnot lull her with his songs of lamentation. Abraham grew old, and Sarah\nbecame a laughing-stock to the people; and yet was he God's chosen, and\nheir to the promise that in his seed were to be blessed all races of\nmankind. Were it, then, not better if he had not been God's chosen? For\nwhat is it to be God's chosen? Is it to have denied to one in one's\nyouth all the wishes of youth in order to have them fulfilled after\ngreat labor in old age?\nBut Abraham had faith and steadfastly lived in hope. Had Abraham been\nless firm in his trust, then would he have given up that hope. He would\nhave said to God: \"So it is, perchance, not Thy will, after all, that\nthis shall come to pass. I shall surrender my hope. It was my only one,\nit was my bliss. I am sincere, I conceal no secret grudge for that Thou\ndidst deny it to me.\" He would not have remained forgotten, his example\nwould have saved many a one; but he would not have become the Father of\nFaith. For it is great to surrender one's hope, but greater still to\nabide by it steadfastly after having surrendered it; for it is great to\nseize hold of the eternal hope, but greater still to abide steadfastly\nby one's worldly hopes after having surrendered them.\nThen came the fulness of time. If Abraham had not had faith, then Sarah\nwould probably have died of sorrow, and Abraham, dulled by his grief,\nwould not have understood the fulfillment, but would have smiled about\nit as a dream of his youth. But Abraham had faith, and therefore he\nremained young; for he who always hopes for the best, him life will\ndeceive, and he will grow old; and he who is always prepared for the\nworst, he will soon age; but he who has faith, he will preserve eternal\nyouth. Praise, therefore, be to this story! For Sarah, though advanced\nin age, was young enough to wish for the pleasures of a mother, and\nAbraham, though grey of hair, was young enough to wish to become a\nfather. In a superficial sense it may be considered miraculous that\nwhat they wished for came to pass, but in a deeper sense the miracle of\nfaith is to be seen in Abraham's and Sarah's being young enough to\nwish, and their faith having preserved their wish and therewith their\nyouth. The promise he had received was fulfilled, and he accepted it in\nfaith, and it came to pass according to the promise and his faith;\nwhereas Moses smote the rock with his staff but believed not.\nThere was joy in Abraham's house when Sarah celebrated the day of her\nGolden Wedding.\nBut it was not to remain thus; for once more was Abraham to be tempted.\nHe had struggled with that cunning power to which nothing is\nimpossible, with that ever watchful enemy who never sleeps, with that\nold man who outlives all\u2014he had struggled with Time and had preserved\nhis faith. And now all the terror of that fight was concentrated in one\nmoment. \"And God tempted Abraham, saying to him: take now thine only\nson Isaac, whom thou lovest, and get thee into the land of Moriah; and\noffer him there for a burnt offering upon one of the mountains which I\nwill tell thee off.[157][2]\"\nAll was lost, then, and more terribly than if a son had never been\ngiven him! The Lord had only mocked Abraham, then! Miraculously he had\nrealized the unreasonable hopes of Abraham; and now he wished to take\naway what he had given. A foolish hope it had been, but Abraham had not\nlaughed when the promise had been made him. Now all was lost\u2014the\ntrusting hope of seventy years, the brief joy at the fulfillment of his\nhopes. Who, then, is he that snatches away the old man's staff, who\nthat demands that he himself shall break it in two? Who is he that\nrenders disconsolate the grey hair of old age, who is he that demands\nthat he himself shall do it? Is there no pity for the venerable old\nman, and none for the innocent child? And yet was Abraham God's chosen\none, and yet was it the Lord that tempted him. And now all was to be\nlost! The glorious remembrance of him by a whole race, the promise of\nAbraham's seed\u2014all that was but a whim, a passing fancy of the Lord,\nwhich Abraham was now to destroy forever! That glorious treasure, as\nold as the faith in Abraham's heart, and many, many years older than\nIsaac, the fruit of Abraham's life, sanctified by prayers, matured in\nstruggles\u2014the blessing on the lips of Abraham: this fruit was now to be\nplucked before the appointed time, and to remain without significance;\nfor of what significance were it if Isaac was to be sacrificed? That\nsad and yet blessed hour when Abraham was to take leave from all that\nwas dear to him, the hour when he would once more lift up his venerable\nhead, when his face would shine like the countenance of the Lord, the\nhour when he would collect his whole soul for a blessing strong enough\nto render Isaac blessed all the days of his life\u2014that hour was not to\ncome! He was to say farewell to Isaac, to be sure, but in such wise\nthat he himself was to remain behind; death was to part them, but in\nsuch wise that Isaac was to die. The old man was not in happiness to\nlay his hand on Isaac's head when the hour of death came, but, tired of\nlife, to lay violent hands on Isaac. And it was God who tempted him.\nWoe, woe to the messenger who would have come before Abraham with such\na command! Who would have dared to be the messenger of such dread\ntidings? But it was God that tempted Abraham.\nBut Abraham had faith, and had faith for this life. Indeed, had his\nfaith been but concerning the life to come, then might he more easily\nhave cast away all, in order to hasten out of this world which was not\nhis....\nBut Abraham had faith and doubted not, but trusted that the improbable\nwould come to pass. If Abraham had doubted, then would he have\nundertaken something else, something great and noble; for what could\nAbraham have undertaken but was great and noble! He would have\nproceeded to Mount Moriah, he would have cloven the wood, and fired it,\nand unsheathed his knife\u2014he would have cried out to God: \"Despise not\nthis sacrifice; it is not, indeed, the best I have; for what is an old\nman against a child foretold of God; but it is the best I can give\nthee. Let Isaac never know that he must find consolation in his youth.\"\nHe would have plunged the steel in his own breast. And he would have\nbeen admired throughout the world, and his name would not have been\nforgotten; but it is one thing to be admired and another, to be a\nlode-star which guides one troubled in mind.\nBut Abraham had faith. He prayed not for mercy and that he might\nprevail upon the Lord: it was only when just retribution was to be\nvisited upon Sodom and Gomorrha that Abraham ventured to beseech Him\nfor mercy.\nWe read in Scripture: \"And God did tempt Abraham, and said unto him,\nAbraham: and he said, Behold here I am.[158][3]\" You, whom I am now\naddressing did you do likewise? When you saw the dire dispensations of\nProvidence approach threateningly, did you not then say to the\nmountains, Fall on me; and to the hills, Cover me?[159][4] Or, if you\nwere stronger in faith, did not your step linger along the way, longing\nfor the old accustomed paths, as it were? And when the voice called\nyou, did you answer, then, or not at all, and if you did, perchance in\na low voice, or whispering? Not thus Abraham, but gladly and cheerfully\nand trustingly, and with a resonant voice he made answer: \"Here am I.\"\nAnd we read further: \"And Abraham rose up early in the\nmorning.[160][5]\" He made haste as though for some joyous occasion, and\nearly in the morning he was in the appointed place, on Mount Moriah. He\nsaid nothing to Sarah, nothing to Eliezer, his steward; for who would\nhave understood him? Did not his temptation by its very nature demand\nof him the vow of silence? \"He laid the wood in order, and bound Isaac\nhis son, and laid him on the altar upon the wood. And Abraham stretched\nforth his hand, and took the knife to slay his son.[161][6]\" My\nlistener! Many a father there has been who thought that with his child\nhe lost the dearest of all there was in the world for him; yet\nassuredly no child ever was in that sense a pledge of God as was Isaac\nto Abraham. Many a father there has been who lost his child; but then\nit was God, the unchangeable and inscrutable will of the Almighty and\nHis hand which took it. Not thus with Abraham. For him was reserved a\nmore severe trial, and Isaac's fate was put into Abraham's hand\ntogether with the knife. And there he stood, the old man, with his only\nhope! Yet did he not doubt, nor look anxiously to the left or right,\nnor challenge Heaven with his prayers. He knew it was God the Almighty\nwho now put him to the test; he knew it was the greatest sacrifice\nwhich could be demanded of him; but he knew also that no sacrifice was\ntoo great which God demanded\u2014and he drew forth his knife.\nWho strengthened Abraham's arm, who supported his right arm that it\ndrooped not powerless? For he who contemplates this scene is unnerved.\nWho strengthened Abraham's soul so that his eyes grew not too dim to\nsee either Isaac or the ram? For he who contemplates this scene will be\nstruck with blindness. And yet, it is rare enough that one is unnerved\nor is struck with blindness, and still more rare that one narrates\nworthily what there did take place between father and son. To be sure,\nwe know well enough\u2014it was but a trial!\nIf Abraham had doubted, when standing on Mount Moriah; if he had looked\nabout him in perplexity; if he had accidentally discovered the ram\nbefore drawing his knife; if God had permitted him to sacrifice it\ninstead of Isaac\u2014then would he have returned home, and all would have\nbeen as before, he would have had Sarah and would have kept Isaac; and\nyet how different all would have been! For then had his return been a\nflight, his salvation an accident, his reward disgrace; his future,\nperchance, perdition. Then would he have borne witness neither to his\nfaith nor to God's mercy, but would have witnessed only to the terror\nof going to Mount Moriah. Then Abraham would not have been forgotten,\nnor either Mount Moriah. It would be mentioned, then, not as is Mount\nArarat on which the Ark landed, but as a sign of terror, because it was\nthere Abraham doubted.\nVenerable patriarch Abraham! When you returned home from Mount Moriah\nyou required no encomiums to console you for what you had lost; for,\nindeed, you did win all and still kept Isaac, as we all know. And the\nLord did no more take him from your side, but you sate gladly at table\nwith him in your tent as in the life to come you will, for all times.\nVenerable patriarch Abraham! Thousands of years have passed since those\ntimes, but still you need no late-born lover to snatch your memory from\nthe power of oblivion, for every language remembers you\u2014and yet do you\nreward your lover more gloriously than any one, rendering him blessed\nin your bosom, and taking heart and eyes captive by the marvel of your\ndeed. Venerable patriarch Abraham! Second father of the race! You who\nfirst perceived and bore witness to that unbounded passion which has\nbut scorn for the terrible fight with the raging elements and the\nstrength of brute creation, in order to struggle with God; you who\nfirst felt that sublimest of all passions, you who found the holy,\npure, humble expression for the divine madness which was a marvel to\nthe heathen\u2014forgive him who would speak in your praise, in case he did\nit not fittingly. He spoke humbly, as if it concerned the desire of his\nheart; he spoke briefly, as is seemly; but he will never forget that\nyou required a hundred years to obtain a son of your old age, against\nall expections; that you had to draw the knife before being permitted\nto keep Isaac; he will never forget that in a hundred and thirty years\nyou never got farther than to faith.\nPRELIMINARY EXPECTORATION\nAn old saying, derived from the world of experience, has it that \"he\nwho will not work shall not eat.[162][7]\" But, strange to say, this\ndoes not hold true in the world where it is thought applicable; for in\nthe world of matter the law of imperfection prevails, and we see, again\nand again, that he also who will not work has bread to eat\u2014indeed, that\nhe who sleeps has a greater abundance of it than he who works. In the\nworld of matter everything belongs to whosoever happens to possess it;\nit is thrall to the law of indifference, and he who happens to possess\nthe Ring also has the Spirit of the Ring at his beck and call, whether\nnow he be Noureddin or Aladdin,[163][8] and he who controls the\ntreasures of this world, controls them, howsoever he managed to do so.\nIt is different in the world of spirit. There, an eternal and divine\norder obtains, there the rain does not fall on the just and the unjust\nalike, nor does the sun shine on the good and the evil alike;[164][9]\nbut there the saying does hold true that he who will not work shall not\neat, and only he who was troubled shall find rest, and only he who\ndescends into the nether world shall rescue his beloved, and only he\nwho unsheathes his knife shall be given Isaac again. There, he who will\nnot work shall not eat, but shall be deceived, as the gods deceived\nOrpheus with an immaterial figure instead of his beloved\nEuridice,[165][10] deceived him because he was love-sick and not\ncourageous, deceived him because he was a player on the cithara rather\nthan a man. There, it avails not to have an Abraham for one's\nfather,[166][11] or to have seventeen ancestors. But in that world the\nsaying about Israel's maidens will hold true of him who will not work:\nhe shall bring forth wind;[167][12] but he who will work shall give\nbirth to his own father.\nThere is a kind of learning which would presumptuously introduce into\nthe world of spirit the same law of indifference under which the world\nof matter groans. It is thought that to know about great men and great\ndeeds is quite sufficient, and that other exertion is not necessary.\nAnd therefore this learning shall not eat, but shall perish of hunger\nwhile seeing all things transformed into gold by its touch. And what,\nforsooth, does this learning really know? There were many thousands of\ncontemporaries, and countless men in after times, who knew all about\nthe triumphs of Miltiades; but there was only one whom they rendered\nsleepless.[168][13] There have existed countless generations that knew\nby heart, word for word, the story of Abraham; but how many has it\nrendered sleepless?\nNow the story of Abraham has the remarkable property of always being\nglorious, in however limited a sense it is understood; still, here also\nthe point is whether one means to labor and exert one's half. Now\npeople do not care to labor and exert themselves, but wish nevertheless\nto understand the story. They extol Abraham, but how? By expressing the\nmatter in the most general terms and saying: \"the great thing about him\nwas that he loved God so ardently that he was willing to sacrifice to\nHim his most precious possession.\" That is very true; but \"the most\nprecious possession\" is an indefinite expression. As one's thoughts,\nand one's mouth, run on one assumes, in a very easy fashion, the\nidentity of Isaac and \"the most precious possession\"\u2014and meanwhile he\nwho is meditating may smoke his pipe, and his audience comfortably\nstretch out their legs. If the rich youth whom Christ met on his\nway[169][14] had sold all his possessions and given all to the poor, we\nwould extol him as we extol all which is great\u2014aye, would not\nunderstand even him without labor; and yet would he never have become\nan Abraham, notwithstanding his sacrificing the most precious\npossessions he had. That which people generally forget in the story of\nAbraham is his fear and anxiety; for as regards money, one is not\nethically responsible for it, whereas for his son a father has the\nhighest and most sacred responsibility. However, fear is a dreadful\nthing for timorous spirits, so they omit it. And yet they wish to speak\nof Abraham.\nSo they keep on speaking, and in the course of their speech the two\nterms Isaac and \"the most precious thing\" are used alternately, and\neverything is in the best order. But now suppose that among the\naudience there was a man who suffered with sleeplessness\u2014and then the\nmost terrible and profound, the most tragic, and at the same time the\nmost comic, misunderstanding is within the range of possibility. That\nis, suppose this man goes home and wishes to do as did Abraham; for his\nson is his most precious possession. If a certain preacher learned of\nthis he would, perhaps, go to him, he would gather up all his spiritual\ndignity and exclaim: \"Thou abominable creature, thou scum of humanity,\nwhat devil possessed thee to wish to murder thy son?\" And this\npreacher, who had not felt any particular warmth, nor perspired while\nspeaking about Abraham, this preacher would be astonished himself at\nthe earnest wrath with which he poured forth his thunders against that\npoor wretch; indeed, he would rejoice over himself, for never had he\nspoken with such power and unction, and he would have said to his wife:\n\"I am an orator, the only thing I have lacked so far was the occasion.\nLast Sunday, when speaking about Abraham, I did not feel thrilled in\nthe least.\"\nNow, if this same orator had just a bit of sense to spare, I believe he\nwould lose it if the sinner would reply, in a quiet and dignified\nmanner: \"Why, it is on this very same matter you preached, last\nSunday!\" But however could the preacher have entertained such thoughts?\nStill, such was the case, and the preacher's mistake was merely not\nknowing what he was talking about. Ah, would that some poet might see\nhis way clear to prefer such a situation to the stuff and nonsense of\nwhich novels and comedies are full! For the comic and the tragic here\nrun parallel to infinity. The sermon probably was ridiculous enough in\nitself, but it became infinitely ridiculous through the very natural\nconsequence it had. Or, suppose now the sinner was converted by this\nlecture without daring to raise any objection, and this zealous divine\nnow went home elated, glad in the consciousness of being effective, not\nonly in the pulpit, but chiefly, and with irresistible power, as a\nspiritual guide, inspiring his congregation on Sunday, whilst on Monday\nhe would place himself like a cherub with flaming sword before the man\nwho by his actions tried to give the lie to the old saying that \"the\ncourse of the world follows not the priest's word.\"\nIf, on the other hand, the sinner were not convinced of his error his\nposition would become tragic. He would probably be executed, or else\nsent to the lunatic asylum\u2014at any rate, he would become a sufferer in\nthis world; but in another sense I should think that Abraham rendered\nhim happy; for he who labors, he shall not perish.\nNow how shall we explain the contradiction contained in that sermon? Is\nit due to Abraham's having the reputation of being a great man\u2014so that\nwhatever he does is great, but if another should undertake to do the\nsame it is a sin, a heinous sin? If this be the case I prefer not to\nparticipate in such thoughtless laudations. If faith cannot make it a\nsacred thing to wish to sacrifice one's son, then let the same judgment\nbe visited on Abraham as on any other man. And if we perchance lack the\ncourage to drive our thoughts to the logical conclusion and to say that\nAbraham was a murderer, then it were better to acquire that courage,\nrather than to waste one's time on undeserved encomiums. The fact is,\nthe ethical expression for what Abraham did is that he wanted to murder\nIsaac; the religious, that he wanted to sacrifice him. But precisely in\nthis contradiction is contained the fear which may well rob one of\none's sleep. And yet Abraham were not Abraham without this fear. Or,\nagain, supposing Abraham did not do what is attributed to him, if his\naction was an entirely different one, based on conditions of those\ntimes, then let us forget him; for what is the use of calling to mind\nthat past which can no longer become a present reality?\u2014Or, the speaker\nhad perhaps forgotten the essential fact that Isaac was the son. For if\nfaith is eliminated, having been reduced to a mere nothing, then only\nthe brutal fact remains that Abraham wanted to murder Isaac\u2014which is\neasy for everybody to imitate who has not the faith\u2014the faith, that is,\nwhich renders it most difficult for him....\nLove has its priests in the poets, and one hears at times a poet's\nvoice which worthily extols it. But not a word does one hear of faith.\nWho is there to speak in honor of that passion? Philosophy \"goes right\non.\" Theology sits at the window with a painted visage and sues for\nphilosophy's favor, offering it her charms. It is said to be difficult\nto understand the philosophy of Hegel; but to understand Abraham, why,\nthat is an easy matter! To proceed further than Hegel is a wonderful\nfeat, but to proceed further than Abraham, why, nothing is easier!\nPersonally, I have devoted a considerable amount of time to a study of\nHegelian philosophy and believe I understand it fairly well; in fact, I\nam rash enough to say that when, notwithstanding an effort, I am not\nable to understand him in some passages, it is because he is not\nentirely clear about the matter himself. All this intellectual effort I\nperform easily and naturally, and it does not cause my head to ache. On\nthe other hand, whenever I attempt to think about Abraham I am, as it\nwere, overwhelmed. At every moment I am aware of the enormous paradox\nwhich forms the content of Abraham's life, at every moment I am\nrepulsed, and my thought, notwithstanding its passionate attempts,\ncannot penetrate into it, cannot forge on the breadth of a hair. I\nstrain every muscle in order to envisage the problem\u2014and become a\nparalytic in the same moment.\nI am by no means unacquainted with what has been admired as great and\nnoble, my soul feels kinship with it, being satisfied, in all humility,\nthat it was also my cause the hero espoused; and when contemplating his\ndeed I say to myself: \"jam tua causa agitur.[170][15]\" I am able to\nidentify myself with the hero; but I cannot do so with Abraham, for\nwhenever I have reached his height I fall down again, since he\nconfronts me as the paradox. It is by no means my intention to maintain\nthat faith is something inferior, but, on the contrary, that it is the\nhighest of all things; also that it is dishonest in philosophy to offer\nsomething else instead, and to pour scorn on faith; but it ought to\nunderstand its own nature in order to know what it can offer. It should\ntake away nothing; least of all, fool people out of something as if it\nwere of no value. I am not unacquainted with the sufferings and dangers\nof life, but I do not fear them, and cheerfully go forth to meet\nthem.... But my courage is not, for all that, the courage of faith, and\nis as nothing compared with it. I cannot carry out the movement of\nfaith: I cannot close my eyes and confidently plunge into the absurd\u2014it\nis impossible for me; but neither do I boast of it....\nNow I wonder if every one of my contemporaries is really able to\nperform the movements of faith. Unless I am much mistaken they are,\nrather, inclined to be proud of making what they perhaps think me\nunable to do, viz., the imperfect movement. It is repugnant to my soul\nto do what is so often done, to speak inhumanly about great deeds, as\nif a few thousands of years were an immense space of time. I prefer to\nspeak about them in a human way and as though they had been done but\nyesterday, to let the great deed itself be the distance which either\ninspires or condemns me. Now if I, in the capacity of tragic hero\u2014for a\nhigher flight I am unable to take\u2014if I had been summoned to such an\nextraordinary royal progress as was the one to Mount Moriah, I know\nvery well what I would have done. I would not have been craven enough\nto remain at home; neither would I have dawdled on the way; nor would I\nhave forgot my knife\u2014just to draw out the end a bit. But I am rather\nsure that I would have been promptly on the spot, with every thing in\norder\u2014in fact, would probably have been there before the appointed\ntime, so as to have the business soon over with. But I know also what I\nwould have done besides. In the moment I mounted my horse I would have\nsaid to myself: \"Now all is lost, God demands Isaac, I shall sacrifice\nhim, and with him all my joy\u2014but for all that, God is love and will\nremain so for me; for in this world God and I cannot speak together, we\nhave no language in common.\"\nPossibly, one or the other of my contemporaries will be stupid enough,\nand jealous enough of great deeds, to wish to persuade himself and me\nthat if I had acted thus I should have done something even greater than\nwhat Abraham did; for my sublime resignation was (he thinks) by far\nmore ideal and poetic than Abraham's literal-minded action. And yet\nthis is absolutely not so, for my sublime resignation was only a\nsubstitute for faith. I could not have made more than the infinite\nmovement (of resignation) to find myself and again repose in myself.\nNor would I have loved Isaac as Abraham loved him. The fact that I was\nresolute enough to resign is sufficient to prove my courage in a human\nsense, and the fact that I loved him with my whole heart is the very\npresupposition without which my action would be a crime; but still I\ndid not love as did Abraham, for else I would have hesitated even in\nthe last minute, without, for that matter, arriving too late on Mount\nMoriah. Also, I would have spoiled the whole business by my behavior;\nfor if I had had Isaac restored to me I would have been embarrassed.\nThat which was an easy matter for Abraham would have been difficult for\nme, I mean, to rejoice again in Isaac; for he who with all the energy\nof his soul proprio motu et propriis auspiciis[171][16] has made the\ninfinite movement of resignation and can do no more, he will retain\npossession of Isaac only in his sorrow.\nBut what did Abraham? He arrived neither too early nor too late. He\nmounted his ass and rode slowly on his way. And all the while he had\nfaith, believing that God would not demand Isaac of him, though ready\nall the while to sacrifice him, should it be demanded of him. He\nbelieved this on the strength of the absurd; for there was no question\nof human calculation any longer. And the absurdity consisted in God's,\nwho yet made this demand of him, recalling his demand the very next\nmoment. Abraham ascended the mountain and whilst the knife already\ngleamed in his hand he believed\u2014that God would not demand Isaac of him.\nHe was, to be sure, surprised at the outcome; but by a double movement\nhe had returned at his first state of mind and therefore received Isaac\nback more gladly than the first time....\nOn this height, then, stands Abraham. The last stage he loses sight of\nis that of infinite resignation. He does really proceed further, he\narrives at faith. For all these caricatures of faith, wretched lukewarm\nsloth, which thinks: \"Oh, there is no hurry, it is not necessary to\nworry before the time comes\"; and miserable hopefulness, which says:\n\"One cannot know what will happen, there might perhaps\u2014,\" all these\ncaricatures belong to the sordid view of life and have already fallen\nunder the infinite scorn of infinite resignation.\nAbraham, I am not able to understand; and in a certain sense I can\nlearn nothing from him without being struck with wonder. They who\nflatter themselves that by merely considering the outcome of Abraham's\nstory they will necessarily arrive at faith, only deceive themselves\nand wish to cheat God out of the first movement of faith\u2014it were\ntantamount to deriving worldly wisdom from the paradox. But who knows,\none or the other of them may succeed in doing this; for our times are\nnot satisfied with faith, and not even with the miracle of changing\nwater into wine\u2014they \"go right on\" changing wine into water.\nIs it not preferable to remain satisfied with faith, and is it not\noutrageous that every one wishes to \"go right on\"? If people in our\ntimes decline to be satisfied with love, as is proclaimed from various\nsides, where will we finally land? In worldly shrewdness, in mean\ncalculation, in paltriness and baseness, in all that which renders\nman's divine origin doubtful. Were it not better to stand fast in the\nfaith, and better that he that standeth take heed lest he\nfall;[172][17] for the movement of faith must ever be made by virtue of\nthe absurd, but, note well, in such wise that one does not lose the\nthings of this world but wholly and entirely regains them.\nAs far as I am concerned, I am able to describe most excellently the\nmovements of faith; but I cannot make them myself. When a person wishes\nto learn how to swim he has himself suspended in a swimming-belt and\nthen goes through the motions; but that does not mean that he can swim.\nIn the same fashion I too can go through the motions of faith; but when\nI am thrown into the water I swim; to be sure (for I am not a wader in\nthe shallows), but I go through a different set of movements, to-wit,\nthose of infinity; whereas faith does the opposite, to-wit, makes the\nmovements to regain the finite after having made those of infinite\nresignation. Blessed is he who can make these movements, for he\nperforms a marvelous feat, and I shall never weary of admiring him,\nwhether now it be Abraham himself or the slave in Abraham's house,\nwhether it be a professor of philosophy or a poor servant-girl: it is\nall the same to me, for I have regard only to the movements. But these\nmovements I watch closely, and I will not be deceived, whether by\nmyself or by any one else. The knights of infinite resignation are\neasily recognized, for their gait is dancing and bold. But they who\npossess the jewel of faith frequently deceive one because their bearing\nis curiously like that of a class of people heartily despised by\ninfinite resignation as well as by faith\u2014the philistines.\nLet me admit frankly that I have not in my experience encountered any\ncertain specimen of this type; but I do not refuse to admit that as far\nas I know, every other person may be such a specimen. At the same time\nI will say that I have searched vainly for years. It is the custom of\nscientists to travel around the globe to see rivers and mountains, new\nstars, gay-colored birds, misshapen fish, ridiculous races of men. They\nabandon themselves to a bovine stupor which gapes at existence and\nbelieve they have seen something worth while. All this does not\ninterest me; but if I knew where there lived such a knight of faith I\nwould journey to him on foot, for that marvel occupies my thoughts\nexclusively. Not a moment would I leave him out of sight, but would\nwatch how he makes the movements, and I would consider myself provided\nfor life, and would divide my time between watching him and myself\npracticing the movements, and would thus use all my time in admiring\nhim.\nAs I said, I have not met with such a one; but I can easily imagine\nhim. Here he is. I make his acquaintance and am introduced to him. The\nfirst moment I lay my eyes on him I push him back, leaping back myself,\nI hold up my hands in amazement and say to myself: \"Good Lord! that\nperson? Is it really he\u2014why, he looks like a parish-beadle!\" But it is\nreally he. I become more closely acquainted with him, watching his\nevery movement to see whether some trifling incongruous movement of his\nhas escaped me, some trace, perchance, of a signaling from the\ninfinite, a glance, a look, a gesture, a melancholy air, or a smile,\nwhich might betray the presence of infinite resignation contrasting\nwith the finite.\nBut no! I examine his figure from top to toe to discover whether there\nbe anywhere a chink through which the infinite might be seen to peer\nforth. But no! he is of a piece, all through. And how about his\nfooting? Vigorous, altogether that of finiteness, no citizen dressed in\nhis very best, prepared to spend his Sunday afternoon in the park,\ntreads the ground more firmly. He belongs altogether to this world, no\nphilistine more so. There is no trace of the somewhat exclusive and\nhaughty demeanor which marks off the knight of infinite resignation. He\ntakes pleasure in all things, is interested in everything, and\nperseveres in whatever he does with the zest characteristic of persons\nwholly given to worldly things. He attends to his business, and when\none sees him one might think he was a clerk who had lost his soul in\ndoing double bookkeeping, he is so exact. He takes a day off on\nSundays. He goes to church. But no hint of anything supernatural or any\nother sign of the incommensurable betrays him, and if one did not know\nhim it would be impossible to distinguish him in the congregation, for\nhis brisk and manly singing proves only that he has a pair of good\nlungs.\nIn the afternoon he walks out to the forest. He takes delight in all he\nsees, in the crowds of men and women, the new omnibuses, the Sound\u2014if\none met him on the promenade one might think he was some shopkeeper who\nwas having a good time, so simple is his joy; for he is not a poet, and\nin vain have I tried to lure him into betraying some sign of the poet's\ndetachment. Toward evening he walks home again, with a gait as steady\nas that of a mail-carrier. On his way he happens to wonder whether his\nwife will have some little special warm dish ready for him, when he\ncomes home\u2014as she surely has\u2014as, for instance, a roasted lamb's head\ngarnished with greens. And if he met one minded like him he is very\nlikely to continue talking about this dish with him till they reach the\nEast Gate, and to talk about it with a zest befitting a chef. As it\nhappens, he has not four shillings to spare, and yet he firmly believes\nthat his wife surely has that dish ready for him. If she has, it would\nbe an enviable sight for distinguished people, and an inspiring one for\ncommon folks, to see him eat, for he has an appetite greater than\nEsau's. His wife has not prepared it\u2014strange, he remains altogether the\nsame.\nAgain, on his way he passes a building lot and there meets another man.\nThey fall to talking, and in a trice he erects a building, freely\ndisposing of everything necessary. And the stranger will leave him with\nthe impression that he has been talking with a capitalist\u2014the fact\nbeing that the knight of my admiration is busy with the thought that if\nit really came to the point he would unquestionably have the means\nwherewithal at his disposal.\nNow he is lying on his elbows in the window and looking over the square\non which he lives. All that happens there, if it be only a rat creeping\ninto a gutter-hole, or children playing together\u2014everything engages his\nattention, and yet his mind is at rest as though it were the mind of a\ngirl of sixteen. He smokes his pipe in the evening, and to look at him\nyou would swear it was the green-grocer from across the street who is\nlounging at the window in the evening twilight. Thus he shows as much\nunconcern as any worthless happy-go-lucky fellow; and yet, every moment\nhe lives he purchases his leisure at the highest price, for he makes\nnot the least movement except by virtue of the absurd; and yet,\nyet\u2014indeed, I might become furious with anger, if for no other reason\nthan that of envy\u2014and yet, this man has performed, and is performing\nevery moment, the movement of infinity... He has resigned everything\nabsolutely, and then again seized hold of it all on the strength of the\nabsurd...\nBut this miracle may so easily deceive one that it will be best if I\ndescribe the movements in a given case which may illustrate their\naspect in contact with reality; and that is the important point.\nSuppose, then, a young swain falls in love with a princess, and all his\nlife is bound up in this love. But circumstances are such that it is\nout of the question to think of marrying her, an impossibility to\ntranslate his dreams into reality. The slaves of paltriness, the frogs\nin the sloughs of life, they will shout, of course: \"Such a love is\nfolly, the rich brewer's widow is quite as good and solid a match.\" Let\nthem but croak. The knight of infinite resignation does not follow\ntheir advice, he does not surrender his love, not for all the riches in\nthe world. He is no fool, he first makes sure that this love really is\nthe contents of his life, for his soul is too sound and too proud to\nwaste itself on a mere intoxication. He is no coward, he is not afraid\nto let his love insinuate itself into his most secret and most remote\nthoughts, to let it wind itself in innumerable coils about every fiber\nof his consciousness\u2014if he is disappointed in his love he will never be\nable to extricate himself again. He feels a delicious pleasure in\nletting love thrill his every nerve, and yet his soul is solemn as is\nthat of him who has drained a cup of poison and who now feels the virus\nmingle with every drop of his blood, poised in that moment between life\nand death.\nHaving thus imbibed love, and being wholly absorbed in it, he does not\nlack the courage to try and dare all. He surveys the whole situation,\nhe calls together his swift thoughts which like tame pigeons obey his\nevery beck, he gives the signal, and they dart in all directions. But\nwhen they return, every one bearing a message of sorrow, and explain to\nhim that it is impossible, then he becomes silent, he dismisses them,\nhe remains alone; and then he makes the movement. Now if what I say\nhere is to have any significance, it is of prime importance that the\nmovement be made in a normal fashion. The knight of resignation is\nsupposed to have sufficient energy to concentrate the entire contents\nof his life and the realization of existing conditions into one single\nwish. But if one lacks this concentration, this devotion to a single\nthought; if his soul from the very beginning is scattered on a number\nof objects, he will never be able to make the movement\u2014he will be as\nworldly-wise in the conduct of his life as the financier who invests\nhis capital in a number of securities to win on the one if he should\nlose on the other; that is, he is no knight. Furthermore, the knight is\nsupposed to possess sufficient energy to concentrate all his thought\ninto a single act of consciousness. If he lacks this concentration he\nwill only run errands in life and will never be able to assume the\nattitude of infinite resignation; for the very minute he approaches it\nhe will suddenly discover that he forgot something so that he must\nremain behind. The next minute, thinks he, it will be attainable again,\nand so it is; but such inhibitions will never allow him to make the\nmovement but will, rather, tend to let him sink ever deeper into the\nmire.\nOur knight, then, performs the movement\u2014which movement? Is he intent on\nforgetting the whole affair, which, too, would presuppose much\nconcentration? No, for the knight does not contradict himself, and it\nis a contradiction to forget the main contents of one's life and still\nremain the same person. And he has no desire to become another person;\nneither does he consider such a desire to smack of greatness. Only\nlower natures forget themselves and become something different. Thus\nthe butterfly has forgotten that it once was a caterpillar\u2014who knows\nbut it may forget altogether that it once was a butterfly, and turn\ninto a fish! Deeper natures never forget themselves and never change\ntheir essential qualities. So the knight remembers all; but precisely\nthis remembrance is painful. Nevertheless, in his infinite resignation\nhe has become reconciled with existence. His love for the princess has\nbecome for him the expression of an eternal love, has assumed a\nreligious character, has been transfigured into a love for the eternal\nbeing which, to be sure, denied him the fulfillment of his love, yet\nreconciled him again by presenting him with the abiding consciousness\nof his love's being preserved in an everlasting form of which no\nreality can rob him....\nNow, he is no longer interested in what the princess may do, and\nprecisely this proves that he has made the movement of infinite\nresignation correctly. In fact, this is a good criterion for detecting\nwhether a person's movement is sincere or just make-believe. Take a\nperson who believes that he too has resigned, but lo! time passed, the\nprincess did something on her part, for example, married a prince, and\nthen his soul lost the elasticity of its resignation. This ought to\nshow him that he did not make the movement correctly, for he who has\nresigned absolutely is sufficient unto himself. The knight does not\ncancel his resignation, but preserves his love as fresh and young as it\nwas at the first moment, he never lets go of it just because his\nresignation is absolute. Whatever the princess does, cannot disturb\nhim, for it is only the lower natures who have the law for their\nactions in some other person, i.e. have the premises of their actions\noutside of themselves....\nInfinite resignation is the last stage which goes before faith, so that\nevery one who has not made the movement of infinite resignation cannot\nhave faith; for only through absolute resignation do I become conscious\nof my eternal worth, and only then can there arise the problem of again\ngrasping hold of this world by virtue of faith.\nWe will now suppose the knight of faith in the same case. He does\nprecisely as the other knight, he absolutely resigns the love which is\nthe contents of his life, he is reconciled to the pain; but then the\nmiraculous happens, he makes one more movement, strange beyond\ncomparison, saying: \"And still I believe that I shall marry her\u2014marry\nher by virtue of the absurd, by virtue of the act that to God nothing\nis impossible.\" Now the absurd is not one of the categories which\nbelong to the understanding proper. It is not identical with the\nimprobable, the unforeseen, the unexpected. The very moment our knight\nresigned himself he made sure of the absolute impossibility, in any\nhuman sense, of his love. This was the result reached by his\nreflections, and he had sufficient energy to make them. In a\ntranscendent sense, however, by his very resignation, the attainment of\nhis end is not impossible; but this very act of again taking possession\nof his love is at the same time a relinquishment of it. Nevertheless\nthis kind of possession is by no means an absurdity to the intellect;\nfor the intellect all the while continues to be right, as it is aware\nthat in the world of finalities, in which reason rules, his love was\nand is, an impossibility. The knight of faith realizes this fully as\nwell. Hence the only thing which can save him is recourse to the\nabsurd, and this recourse he has through his faith. That is, he clearly\nrecognizes the impossibility, and in the same moment he believes the\nabsurd; for if he imagined he had faith, without at the same time\nrecognizing, with all the passion his soul is capable of, that his love\nis impossible, he would be merely deceiving himself, and his testimony\nwould be of no value, since he had not arrived even at the stage of\nabsolute resignation....\nThis last movement, the paradoxical movement of faith, I cannot make,\nwhether or no it be my duty, although I desire nothing more ardently\nthan to be able to make it. It must be left to a person's discretion\nwhether he cares to make this confession; and at any rate, it is a\nmatter between him and the Eternal Being, who is the object of his\nfaith, whether an amicable adjustment can be affected. But what every\nperson can do is to make the movement of absolute resignation, and I\nfor my part would not hesitate to declare him a coward who imagines he\ncannot perform it. It is a different matter with faith. But what no\nperson has a right to, is to delude others into the belief that faith\nis something of no great significance, or that it is an easy matter,\nwhereas it is the greatest and most difficult of all things.\nBut the story of Abraham is generally interpreted in a different way.\nGod's mercy is praised which restored Isaac to him\u2014it was but a trial!\nA trial. This word may mean much or little, and yet the whole of it\npasses off as quickly as the story is told: one mounts a winged horse,\nin the same instant one arrives on Mount Moriah, and presto one sees\nthe ram. It is not remembered that Abraham only rode on an ass which\ntravels but slowly, that it was a three days' journey for him, and that\nhe required some additional time to collect the firewood, to bind\nIsaac, and to whet his knife.\nAnd yet one extols Abraham. He who is to preach the sermon may sleep\ncomfortably until a quarter of an hour before he is to preach it, and\nthe listener may comfortably sleep during the sermon, for everything is\nmade easy enough, without much exertion either to preacher or listener.\nBut now suppose a man was present who suffered with sleeplessness and\nwho went home and sat in a corner and reflected as follows: \"The whole\nlasted but a minute, you need only wait a little while, and then the\nram will be shown and the trial will be over.\" Now if the preacher\nshould find him in this frame of mind, I believe he would confront him\nin all his dignity and say to him: \"Wretch that thou art, to let thy\nsoul lapse into such folly; miracles do not happen, all life is a\ntrial.\" And as he proceeded he would grow more and more passionate, and\nwould become ever more satisfied with himself; and whereas he had not\nnoticed any congestion in his head whilst preaching about Abraham, he\nnow feels the veins on his forehead swell. Yet who knows but he would\nstand aghast if the sinner should answer him in a quiet and dignified\nmanner that it was precisely this about which he preached the Sunday\nbefore.\nLet us then either waive the whole story of Abraham, or else learn to\nstand in awe of the enormous paradox which constitutes his significance\nfor us, so that we may learn to understand that our age, like every\nage, may rejoice if it has faith. If the story of Abraham is not a mere\nnothing, an illusion, or if it is just used for show and as a pastime,\nthe mistake cannot by any means be in the sinner's wishing to do\nlikewise; but it is necessary to find out how great was the deed which\nAbraham performed, in order that the man may judge for himself whether\nhe has the courage and the mission to do likewise. The comical\ncontradiction in the procedure of the preacher was his reduction of the\nstory of Abraham to insignificance whereas he rebuked the other man for\ndoing the very same thing.\nBut should we then cease to speak about Abraham? I certainly think not.\nBut if I were to speak about him I would first of all describe the\nterrors of his trial. To that end leech-like I would suck all the\nsuffering and distress out of the anguish of a father, in order to be\nable to describe what Abraham suffered whilst yet preserving his faith.\nI would remind the hearer that the journey lasted three days and a\ngoodly part of the fourth\u2014in fact, these three and a half days ought to\nbecome infinitely longer than the few thousand years which separate me\nfrom Abraham. I would remind him, as I think right, that every person\nis still permitted to turn about-before trying his strength on this\nformidable task; in fact, that he may return every instant in\nrepentance. Provided this is done, I fear for nothing. Nor do I fear to\nawaken great desire among people to attempt to emulate Abraham. But to\nget out a cheap edition of Abraham and yet forbid every one to do as he\ndid, that I call ridiculous.", "source": "fear_and_trembling.txt"}
