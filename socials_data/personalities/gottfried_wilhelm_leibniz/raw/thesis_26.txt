26. The memory furnishes a sort of consecutiveness which imitates
   reason but is to be distinguished from it. We see that animals when
   they have the perception of something which they notice and. of which
   they have had a similar previous perception, are led by the
   representation of their memory to expect that which was associated in
   the preceding perception, and they come to have feelings like those
   which they had before. For instance, if a stick be shown to a dog, he
   remembers the pain which it has caused him and he whines or runs away.
