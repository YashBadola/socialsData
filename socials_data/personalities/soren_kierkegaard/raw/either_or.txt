DIAPSALMATA

What is a poet? An unhappy man who in his heart harbors a deep anguish, but whose lips are so fashioned that the sighs and cries which pass over them are transformed into ravishing music. His fate is like that of the victims whom Phalaris imprisoned in his brazen bull, who were slowly tortured over a slow fire; their cries could not reach the tyrant's ears so as to strike terror into his heart; when they reached his ears they sounded like sweet music.

People misunderstand me. I am not like them. I am not a part of their world. I am a stranger here.

I have just now come from a party where I was its life and soul; witticisms streamed from my lips, everyone laughed and admired me, but I went away — yes, the dash should be as long as the radius of the earth's orbit ——————————— and wanted to shoot myself.

Marry, and you will regret it. Do not marry, and you will also regret it. Marry or do not marry, you will regret it either way.
Laugh at the world’s follies, you will regret it, weep over them, you will also regret that. Laugh at the world’s follies or weep over them, you will regret it either way.
Believe a woman, you will regret it, believe her not, you will also regret that. Believe a woman or believe her not, you will regret it either way.
Hang yourself, you will regret it; do not hang yourself, and you will also regret that. Hang yourself or do not hang yourself, you will regret it either way.
This, gentlemen, is the sum and substance of all philosophy.

My life is like an eternal night.

The present state of the world and the whole of life is diseased. If I were a doctor and were asked for my advice, I should reply: Create silence! Bring men to silence. The word of God cannot be heard in the noisy world of today. And even if it were blazoned forth with all the panoply of noise so that it could be heard in the midst of all the other noise, then it would no longer be the word of God. Therefore create silence.

I divide my time as follows: half the time I sleep, the other half I dream. I never dream when I sleep, for that would be a pity, for sleeping is the highest genius.

Let others complain that the age is wicked; my complaint is that it is paltry; for it lacks passion. Men’s thoughts are thin and flimsy like lace, they are themselves pitiable like the lacemakers. The thoughts of their hearts are too paltry to be sinful. For a worm it might be regarded as a sin to harbor such thoughts, but not for a being made in the image of God. Their lusts are dull and sluggish, their passions sleepy. They do their duty, these shopkeeping souls, but they permit themselves, like the Jews, to trim the coins a little. They think that even if the Lord keeps a careful set of books, they may still cheat Him a little. Out upon them! This is the reason my soul always turns back to the Old Testament and to Shakespeare. There one still feels that those who speak are human beings; there they hate, there they love, there they murder their enemies, and curse their descendants throughout all generations, there they sin.
