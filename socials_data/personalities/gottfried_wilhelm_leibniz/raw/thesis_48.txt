48. In God are present: power, which is the source of everything;
   knowledge, which contains the details of the ideas; and, finally, will,
   which changes or produces things in accordance with the principle of
   the greatest good. To these correspond in the created monad, the
   subject or basis, the faculty of perception, and the faculty of
   appetition. In God these attributes are absolutely infinite or perfect,
   while in the created monads or in the entelechies (perfectihabies, as
   Hermolaus Barbarus translates this word), they are imitations
   approaching him in proportion to the perfection.
