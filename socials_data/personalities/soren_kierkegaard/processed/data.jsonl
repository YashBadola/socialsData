{"text": "The Sickness Unto Death is Despair.\nThis sickness is not unto death. But this must not be understood in the sense that the sickness does not lead to death, for it does indeed lead to death. The torment of despair is precisely this: not to be able to die. So it has much in common with the situation of the agonizingly dying, who tosses and turns and cannot find a position which brings relief. Thus to be sick unto death is to be unable to die, but not as if there were hope of life; no, the hopelessness is that there is not even the ultimate hope, death. When death is the greatest danger, one hopes for life; but when one becomes acquainted with an even more dreadful danger, one hopes for death. So when the danger is so great that death has become one\u2019s hope, despair is the disconsolateness of not being able to die.\nIt is in this last sense that despair is the sickness unto death, this agonizing contradiction, this sickness in the self, everlastingly to die, to die and yet not to die, to die death. For to die signifies that it is all over, but to die the death means to experience dying; and if one experiences it, one must thereby survive it. If one were to die of despair as one dies of a sickness, then the eternal in him, the self, must be capable of dying in the same sense as the body dies of sickness. But this is an impossibility; the dying of despair transforms itself constantly into a living. The despairing man cannot die; no more than \"the dagger can slay thoughts\" can despair consume the eternal thing, the self, which is the ground of despair, whose worm dieth not, and whose fire is not quenched.\nA human being is spirit. But what is spirit? Spirit is the self. But what is the self? The self is a relation that relates itself to itself or is the relation's relating itself to itself in the relation; the self is not the relation but that the relation relates itself to itself. A human being is a synthesis of the infinite and the finite, of the temporal and the eternal, of freedom and necessity, in short, a synthesis. A synthesis is a relation between two. Considered in this way, a human being is still not a self.", "source": "sickness_unto_death.txt"}
{"text": "Preface\nNot only in the world of commerce but also in the world of ideas our age is putting on a veritable clearance sale. Everything can be had so dirt cheap that one begins to wonder whether in the end anyone will want to make a bid. Every speculative price-fixer who conscientiously directs attention to the significant march of modern philosophy, every Privat-docent, tutor, and student, every crofter and cottar in philosophy, is not content with doubting everything but goes further. Perhaps it would be untimely and ill-timed to ask them where they are going, but surely it is courteous and not without humble regard for individual subjects to assume that they have doubted everything, since otherwise it would be queer to say that they are going further. Having made this preliminary movement, they have probably made it in such a way that they do not need to make it again, and so presumably they have also understood that to doubt everything is not an easy thing to do, that it is not a task one can undertake in an off-hand manner\u2014unless one is prepared to look as foolish as the person who would attempt to weave with a heavy hand.\nFaith is precisely this paradox, that the single individual as the particular is higher than the universal, is justified before it, not as inferior to it but as superior\u2014yet in such a way, please note, that it is the single individual who, after being subordinate as the particular to the universal, now through the universal becomes the individual who as the particular is superior to the universal, that the single individual as the single individual stands in an absolute relation to the absolute. This position cannot be mediated, for all mediation comes about precisely by virtue of the universal; it is and remains to all eternity a paradox, inaccessible to thought. And yet faith is this paradox\u2014or else (these are the logical deductions which I would beg the reader to have in mind at every point, though it would be too prolix for me to cite them on every occasion)\u2014or else there never has been faith...\nThe Knight of Faith is the only happy man, the heir to the finite, while the Knight of Resignation is a stranger and a foreigner. To get the princess, to live with her joyfully and happily day by day (for it is also conceivable that the knight of resignation might get the princess, but that his soul had discerned the impossibility of their future happiness), to express the sublime in the pedestrian\u2014that only the knight of faith can do, and this is the one and only prodigy.", "source": "fear_and_trembling.txt"}
{"text": "Diapsalmata\nWhat is a poet? An unhappy man who in his heart harbors a deep anguish, but whose lips are so fashioned that the sighs and cries which pass over them are transformed into ravishing music. His fate is like that of the unfortunate victims whom the tyrant Phalaris imprisoned in a brazen bull, and slowly tortured over a slow fire; their cries could not reach the tyrant's ears so as to strike terror into his heart; when they reached him they sounded like sweet music.\nI have just now come from a party where I was its life and soul; witticisms streamed from my lips, everyone laughed and admired me, but I went away \u2014 yes, the dash should be as long as the radius of the earth's orbit \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 and wanted to shoot myself.\nMy life is like an eternal night... when I look at the stars, I think of the little hole in the prison wall...\nI divide my time as follows: half the time I sleep, the other half I dream. I never dream when I sleep, for that would be a pity, for sleeping is the highest genius.\nThe result of my life is simply nothing, a mood, a single color. My result is like the painting of the artist who was to paint the Israelites crossing the Red Sea. To this end, he painted the whole wall red, explaining that the Israelites had already crossed over, and that the Egyptians were drowned.\nLet others complain that the age is wicked; my complaint is that it is paltry; for it lacks passion. Men's thoughts are thin and flimsy like lace, they are themselves pitiable like the lacemakers. The thoughts of their hearts are too paltry to be sinful. For a worm it might be regarded as a sin to harbor such thoughts, but not for a being made in the image of God. Their lusts are dull and sluggish, their passions sleepy. They do their duty, these shopkeeper-souls, but they permit themselves, like the Jews, a slight clipping of the coin...", "source": "either_or.txt"}
