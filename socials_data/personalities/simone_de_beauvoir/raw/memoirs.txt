MEMOIRS OF A DUTIFUL DAUGHTER

I was born at four o'clock in the morning on the 9th of January 1908, in a room fitted with white-lacquered furniture, which overlooked the Boulevard Raspail.

I remember. I am sitting in a high chair at a table. In front of me there is a white plate with a picture of a dog on it. My mother is feeding me soup. I turn my head away. The spoon follows my mouth. I begin to cry.
The taste of the soup, the smell of the room, the sound of my mother's voice: these are the first things I remember.

As a child, I was very religious. I believed in God, in the angels, in the saints. I went to Mass every Sunday. I confessed my sins. I prayed. But as I grew older, I began to question my faith. I read books that my parents would not have approved of. I began to think for myself.

One day, I realized that I no longer believed in God. It was a terrifying realization, but also a liberating one. I was alone in the universe, but I was also free.

I had a friend named Zaza. She was everything I was not: lively, spontaneous, rebellious. We were inseparable. We shared our secrets, our dreams, our fears. But Zaza was also a victim of her environment. She was stifled by the conventions of her family, by the expectations of society. She died young, and her death haunted me for years. It was a reminder of the fragility of life, and of the price that one must pay for freedom.

My father was a man of letters. He loved books, the theater, the arts. He encouraged me to read, to learn, to think. But he was also a man of his time. He believed that women were inferior to men, that their place was in the home. He was disappointed that I was not a boy. "Simone has a man's brain," he used to say. It was a compliment, but it was also a burden. It meant that I had to prove myself, that I had to be better than a woman.

I decided early on that I would not be a housewife. I wanted to write. I wanted to travel. I wanted to live my own life. And so I studied. I passed my exams. I became a teacher. I met Sartre. And I began to write.

Writing was my way of existing. It was my way of making sense of the world, of giving meaning to my life. "If I were to succeed in explaining myself," I thought, "I should have explained everything."
