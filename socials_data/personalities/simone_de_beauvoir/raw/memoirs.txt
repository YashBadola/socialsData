I was born at four o'clock in the morning on the 9th of January 1908, in a room fitted with white-lacquered furniture and overlooking the Boulevard Raspail. In the family photographs taken the following summer, one sees young ladies in long dresses and ostrich-feather hats, and gentlemen wearing straw boaters, all smiling at a baby: they are my parents, my grandfather, uncles, aunts; and I am the baby. My father was thirty, my mother twenty-one, and I was their first child. I turn the page: here is a photograph of Mama holding in her arms a baby who isn't me; I am wearing a plaid skirt and a beret, and I am two and a half years old. I was jealous of my sister.

I was a dutiful daughter. I accepted the values of my environment: God, country, family. I went to a Catholic school, the Cours Désir. I was a good student. I loved to learn. But very early on, I felt a certain detachment. I observed the adults around me, their contradictions, their hypocrisies.

When I was about fifteen, I lost my faith. It was not a sudden crisis, but a slow erosion. I realized that God was an hypothesis I no longer needed. The world was enough for me. But this loss of faith left a void. If God did not exist, everything was permitted, said Ivan Karamazov. But if everything is permitted, is anything important? I had to find my own values, create my own meaning.

I decided that I would be a writer. I wanted to tell the truth about my life, about the lives of women. I wanted to leave a mark on the world. I met Sartre at the Sorbonne. He was ugly, brilliant, and small. He was the first person who fully understood me, who challenged me intellectually. We made a pact: our love would be essential, but we would also have contingent loves. We would tell each other everything.

My youth was ending. I was becoming an adult. I was discovering the weight of the world, the reality of history. I was learning that freedom is a heavy burden, but the only one worth carrying.
